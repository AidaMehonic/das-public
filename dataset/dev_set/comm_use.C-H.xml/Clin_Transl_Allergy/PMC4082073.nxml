Asthma UK charity predicts that more than 75% of hospital visits are preventable by better recognition of symptoms and early management. Hence, education and empowerment of children is a valuable key in reducing hospital visits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>A paediatric Consultant trained five senior medical students in conjunction with their Speak Up For Asthma (SUFA) programme. The medical students delivered an interactive presentation to schoolchildren aged 7-14 years. The effectiveness of the programme was measured by comparing results of an asthma awareness test before and after interactive presentation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Asthma awareness test had 11 questions with combination of true/false and descriptive statements.</p><p>1. The mean score increased from 55% to 93% after the teaching across all ages (p&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>2. Girls pre-course scores were lower than boys but improved to a similar level of &#x0003e;90% after teaching.</p><p>3. Nine and ten year olds showed highest improvement in scores in comparison to other age groups.</p><p>4. The greatest increases were seen in the questions concerning the use of inhalers, asthma attack triggers and correct asthma attack response.</p><p>5. Teachers and school nurses gave positive feedback on asthma update.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Results are encouraging from many viewpoints.</p><p>1. SUFA programme represents a cost effective, low investment opportunity to engage curiosity of schoolchildren.</p><p>2. Although, in the short-term there was significant improvement in the asthma knowledge of schoolchildren, it would be crucial to establish long-term efficacy of the programme by administering similar test at three and six months.</p><p>3. Our results suggest that in its current format the programme confers the most benefit to children aged nine to ten. Alternative ways to engage wider age groups should be studied.</p></sec></body></article>
