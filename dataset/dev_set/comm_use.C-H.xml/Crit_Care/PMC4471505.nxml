All patients were screened on admittance for nasal MRSA, intestinal VRE and ESBL-GN carriage. Patients admitted with any localization of infections due to these organisms were excluded. Patients were monitored for developing nosocomial infections due to MDRO during hospitalization. We evaluated previous colonization as a risk factor for future infections. We used bioMerieux selective chromogenic media for MDRO for screening and Vitek2Compact for identification. Statistical analysis was performed with chi-square test and univariate analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>From 119 screened adult patients, 65 women (54.6%), average age 67 years, we had at screening on admittance into the ICU: 14 positive MRSA (11.8%), 63 positive ESBL-GN (52.9% - 41 strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 26 strains of <italic>Klebsiella </italic>sp., 11 strains of <italic>Proteus mirabilis </italic>and one strain of <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>) and 35 positive VRE (29.4% - 33 strains of <italic>Enterococcus faecium </italic>and two strains of <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>) without concomitant infection with these MDRO. The average duration of ICU stay was 7.32 days. During hospitalization, 14 patients (11.8%) developed nosocomial infections due to MDRO. Colonization with MDRO has preceded nosocomial infections in: one of four patients with MRSA-positive blood cultures (<italic>P </italic>= 0.96), seven of eight patients with ESBL-GN infections (<italic>P </italic>= 0.10) and three of four patients with VRE urinary tract infections (<italic>P </italic>= 0.14). Although not statistically significant, owing to the low number, most patients who developed infections with ESBL-GN had previous intestinal colonization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The carriage of MDRO in ICU-admitted patients is important, especially for ESBL-GN. The incidence of nosocomial infections with MDRO in the ICU is high. ESBL-GN intestinal colonization could be a risk factor for nosocomial infections but further studies are needed to confirm this.</p></sec></body></article>
