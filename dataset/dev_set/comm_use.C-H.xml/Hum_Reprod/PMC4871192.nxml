These observations suggest that malfunction of K<sup>+</sup> channels in human spermatozoa might contribute significantly to the occurrence of subfertility in men. However, remarkably little is known of the nature of K<sup>+</sup> channels in human spermatozoa or the incidence and functional consequences of K<sup>+</sup> channel defects.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION</title><p>Spermatozoa were obtained from healthy volunteer research donors and subfertile IVF and ICSI patients attending a hospital assisted reproductive techniques clinic between May 2013 and December 2015. In total, 40 IVF patients, 41 ICSI patients and 26 normozoospermic donors took part in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS</title><p>Samples were examined using electrophysiology (whole-cell patch clamping). Where abnormal electrophysiological characteristics were identified, spermatozoa were further examined for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced by progesterone and penetration into viscous media if sufficient sample was available. Full exome sequencing was performed to specifically evaluate potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M &#x003b1; 1 (<italic>KCNMA1),</italic> potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily U member 1 <italic>(KCNU1)</italic> and leucine-rich repeat containing 52 (<italic>LRRC52)</italic> genes and others associated with K<sup>+</sup> signalling. In IVF patients, comparison with fertilization rates was done to assess the functional significance of the electrophysiological abnormalities.</p></sec><sec><title>MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE</title><p>Patch clamp electrophysiology was used to assess outward (K<sup>+</sup>) conductance and resting membrane potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) and signalling/motility assays were used to assess functional characteristics of sperm from IVF and ICSI patient samples. The mean <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and outward membrane conductance in sperm from IVF and ICSI patients were not significantly different from those of control (donor) sperm prepared under the same conditions, but variation between individuals was significantly greater (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.02) with a large number of outliers (&#x0003e;25%). In particular, in &#x02248;10% of patients (7/81), we observed either a negligible outward conductance (4 patients) or an enhanced inward current (3 patients), both of which caused depolarization of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>. Analysis of clinical data from the IVF patients showed significant association of depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (&#x02265;0 mV) with low fertilization rate (<italic>P</italic>= 0.012). Spermatozoa with electrophysiological abnormities (conductance and <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) responded normally to progesterone with elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and penetration of viscous medium, indicating retention of cation channel of sperm (CatSper) channel function.</p></sec><sec><title>LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION</title><p>For practical, technical, ethical and logistical reasons, we could not obtain sufficient additional semen samples from men with conductance abnormalities to establish the cause of the conductance defects. Full exome sequencing was only available in two men with conductance defects.</p></sec><sec><title>WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS</title><p>These data add significantly to the understanding of the role of ion channels in human sperm function and its impact on male fertility. Impaired potassium channel conductance (Gm) and/or <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> regulation is both common and complex in human spermatozoa and importantly is associated with impaired fertilization capacity when the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> of cells is completely depolarized.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)</title><p>The majority of the data were obtained using funding from MRC project grants (#MR/K013343/1, MR/012492/1).

In spermatozoa, as in many cell types, <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> modulates the activity of membrane ion channels and transporters, including the sperm-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channel CatSper and voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 (<xref rid="DEW056C5" ref-type="bibr">Darszon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="DEW056C6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="DEW056C11" ref-type="bibr">Lishko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Maintenance and modulation of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> is therefore pivotal to sperm function and characterizing the expression and regulation of membrane K<sup>+</sup> channels is potentially crucial to understanding the function of spermatozoa from both normal and subfertile men.</p><p>Mammalian sperm potassium channels are formed by proteins of the potassium calcium-activated channel (<italic>KCN</italic>) family. In mouse, sperm slowpoke homologue 3 (Slo3), a sperm-specific protein, forms the primary K<sup>+</sup> channel. The pharmacology and biophysical properties of mouse sperm K<sup>+</sup> channels are accurately reconstituted by co-expression of recombinant Slo3 [approved name potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily U member 1 (KCNU1)] and the auxiliary subunit LRRC52 [leucine-rich-repeat-containing protein (<xref rid="DEW056C18" ref-type="bibr">Navarro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="DEW056C21" ref-type="bibr">Santi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="DEW056C25" ref-type="bibr">Zeng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="DEW056C26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="DEW056C27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>)].

This unique approach has allowed us to assess (i) the proportion of men undergoing treatment whose sperm show abnormalities of K<sup>+</sup> channel expression/regulation of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (compared with sperm from normal, &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; donors) and (ii) the association between abnormalities of K<sup>+</sup> channel expression/regulation of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and fertilizing capacity in IVF.

This was also the case for the majority of the ICSI patients; however, in some cases, patients were recruited as part of an IVF failed fertilization research clinic. Patch-clamp electrophysiology has been employed to characterize sperm membrane currents under quasi-physiological conditions (<xref rid="DEW056C15" ref-type="bibr">Mansell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). We employed the identical strategy in order to maximize the information obtained from each patient cell. Outward potassium currents were evoked by imposing a depolarizing voltage ramp from &#x02212;92 to 68 mV. To assess the functional consequences of channel function, comparison with IVF fertilization rates was made. In specific patients of interest (those with channel conductance abnormalities) and, where sufficient semen sample was available, patient samples were also assessed for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in response to progesterone and viscous media penetration test. Additionally, genetic screening was performed only on patient samples with conductance abnormalities who also provided informed consent.</p><p>Patients displaying significant electrophysiological abnormalities and/or examined in more detail are referred to by a single letter (A, C, D, K, X, Y).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Experimental solutions</title><p>Standard extracellular solution: NaCl, 135 mM; KCl, 5 mM; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM; MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM; HEPES, 20 mM; glucose, 5 mM; Na pyruvate, 1 mM; lactic acid, 10 mM; pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH which brought [Na<sup>+</sup>] to 154 mM.

This is by far the most extensive such study ever undertaken. In both IVF and ICSI patients, the mean <italic>I</italic>&#x02013;<italic>V</italic> relationship was similar to that for donor controls. However, the variability of biophysical characteristics (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and Gm) between individuals was much greater among patients than controls (donors) and in a significant minority of patients (20&#x02013;40%), one or more biophysical characteristics were abnormal. In patients recommended for ICSI treatment, multiple abnormalities of spermatogenesis are common, manifested as reduced sperm count, morphology and/or motility (<xref rid="DEW056C20" ref-type="bibr">Sakkas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The detection of ion channel malfunction in these men is therefore perhaps not surprising, although the high incidence of biophysical abnormalities is nevertheless striking. However, patients selected for IVF had effectively &#x02018;normal&#x02019; semen parameters (<xref rid="DEW056C28" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2010</xref>) and the occurrence of biophysical abnormalities in up to 20% of these men supports the hypothesis that ion channel malfunction may contribute significantly to idiopathic male infertility.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Characteristics of currents in patient spermatozoa</title><p>Although the occurrence of greater biophysical variability in spermatozoa of patients must reflect, in part, the presence of some patients with clear abnormalities of current characteristics (see below), there also appeared to be an &#x02018;exaggeration&#x02019; of the innate variability in conductance and reversal potential that was present in the control (donor) group. Outward currents recorded under the quasi-physiological conditions used here are carried primarily by flux through a conductance that is poorly K<sup>+</sup> selective with <italic>G</italic><sub>K</sub>:<italic>G</italic><sub>Na</sub> &#x02248;7 (<xref rid="DEW056C15" ref-type="bibr">Mansell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). This channel shows &#x0003c;25% activation when <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> &#x0003c; 0 mV and although reversal potentials for cells prepared under both capacitating and non-capacitating conditions are closer to <italic>E</italic><sub>K</sub> (&#x02212;79 mV) than <italic>E</italic><sub>Na</sub> (+69 mV), it is clear that the flux of ions other than K<sup>+</sup> contributes to resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>. Since incubating cells under IVF capacitating conditions results in a change in current characteristics, it is possible that uncoupling and/or poor regulation of the changes in channel function that occur during capacitation may result in the observed increase in biophysical variability in the patient population.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Patients with abnormal currents</title><p>Examination of <italic>I</italic>&#x02013;<italic>V</italic> records revealed at least two types of significant current abnormality. In four patients (ICSI patients X, Y, K and IVF Patient D), outward conductance was very low or negligible. Cells in these samples were depolarized and in Patients D and K (13 cells and 8 cells, respectively), the mean <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> was markedly positive (+25 and +6 mV, respectively), resembling <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> after block of K<sup>+</sup> conductance with quinidine or bupivacaine (<xref rid="DEW056C15" ref-type="bibr">Mansell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In spermatozoa from Patient K, we investigated the effect of elevating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to 50 &#x003bc;M, which enhances K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref rid="DEW056C14" ref-type="bibr">Mannowetz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DEW056C3" ref-type="bibr">Brenker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). This manipulation did not &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> or outward conductance. It is noteworthy that although most of these patients are in the ICSI group, Patients X and Y had basic semen characteristics (&#x02265;15 million cells/ml and &#x02265;25% motility) that would be classed as close to normal by WHO standards (WHO, 2010). We conclude that in these four patients, expression and/or function of K<sup>+</sup> conductance is severely impaired.</p><p>A second, characteristic abnormality (seen in two IVF patients and one ICSI patient) was the occurrence of an increased inward current such that <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> was depolarized, despite the presence of outward conductance within the normal range. In IVF Patient C, where recordings from five cells were obtained, inward current at <italic>E</italic><sub>K</sub> (&#x02212;79 mV; where there is no net K<sup>+</sup> flux) was highly variable and significantly greater than in controls. It appears that an inward leak conductance (probably Na<sup>+</sup>) contributed excessively to determination of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> in these patients. Evidence for expression of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>) in human spermatozoa has been reported (<xref rid="DEW056C9" ref-type="bibr">Kong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DEW056C19" ref-type="bibr">Pinto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DEW056C8" ref-type="bibr">Escoffier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DEW056C4" ref-type="bibr">Cejudo-Roman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), but to date, no such currents have been shown in electrophysiological examination of ejaculated cells. If these channels function primarily in spermatogenic cells, incomplete and/or impaired spermatogenesis (or epididymal maturation) might result in over-expression of these conductances in ejaculated cells of these patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Biophysical abnormalities and failure of sperm at IVF</title><p>A key question is, what are the functional consequences of these abnormalities? Fertilization rates of IVF patients were distributed bi-modally with a &#x02018;normal&#x02019; group which typically achieved 70&#x02013;80% oocyte fertilization and a subset where fertilization was 0&#x02013;25%. Of the 19 IVF patients where currents were recorded from &#x02265;3 cells (allowing assessment of population characteristics), only Patients C and D fell in the low fertility group (20% and 12.5% IVF fertilization rate, respectively). Spermatozoa from these patients differed fundamentally from control donor spermatozoa in their biophysical characteristics. Both were strongly depolarized, with the mean <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> &#x0003e; 0 mV, but whereas Patient D was effectively devoid of outward current, in Patient C, the positive <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> reflected the presence of a large inward (probably Na<sup>+</sup>) leak (see above). <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> analysis showed that this association of positive membrane potential with the low IVF fertilization rate was non-random (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02). These data suggest that a strongly depolarized membrane potential (&#x02265;0 mV), irrespective of the underlying lesion(s), has a significant adverse effect on fertilizing ability.</p><p>A surprising finding was that although major, functionally significant (poor fertilizing potential) abnormalities of outward conductance and membrane potential regulation were detected in sperm from some patients, these sperm appeared normal in other assessments employed in this study. For instance, it has been hypothesized that sperm membrane potential and its regulation might be expected to influence CatSper function (<xref rid="DEW056C3" ref-type="bibr">Brenker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), yet the progesterone-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> signal in patients (C, D and K) resembled those of controls (donors) both in &#x02018;normal&#x02019; patients (as described previously; <xref rid="DEW056C1" ref-type="bibr">Alasmari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013a</xref>) and in patients with significantly abnormal conductance and/or depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>. This implies that there is only a weak interaction between <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and CatSper function. Similarly, sperm from Patient C penetrated viscous media to the same degree as controls (donor spermatozoa) both in an unstimulated state and stimulated with the CatSper agonist progesterone. Additionally, despite the apparent loss of K<sup>+</sup> conductance and positive <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> recorded from cells of Patient D, kinematic parameters of sperm motility from this patient (assessed by CASA; data not shown) appeared normal, both in terms of mean value and distribution of single-cell values. Why might these spermatozoa perform normally in these tests even with highly abnormal <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>? One possibility is that the assays employed here are inadequate to detect the subtle interactions between membrane potential, CatSper activity and K<sup>+</sup> channel function (<xref rid="DEW056C3" ref-type="bibr">Brenker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). For instance, CatSper conductance in the absence of progesterone is low even at very depolarized potentials (<xref rid="DEW056C10" ref-type="bibr">Lishko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), but the saturating concentrations of progesterone used here may produce robust [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> signals in human sperm irrespective of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>. Consequently, future studies on sperm with impaired regulation of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> should address more subtle aspects of sperm function such as dose-dependence of the action of progesterone, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the K<sup>+</sup> channel in human spermatozoa and its potential interplay with CatSper (<xref rid="DEW056C3" ref-type="bibr">Brenker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). It will be interesting specifically to investigate long-term patterns of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and motility following CatSper activation in K<sup>+</sup>-channel null/impaired cells.</p><p>We can only speculate as to the nature of the abnormalities(s) that result in altered currents reported here. The characteristics of Patient C and D with reduced fertilization rate are similar to the abnormalities shown in <italic>LRRC52</italic> KO mice with significantly reduced but not absent fertilization rates (<xref rid="DEW056C27" ref-type="bibr">Zeng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). No genetic abnormalities in <italic>SLO1</italic>, <italic>SLO3</italic> or <italic>LRCC52</italic> genes were shown in Patient D (Patient C did not give permission for genetic analysis). It is possible that in the absence of any overt genetic abnormality, a defect(s) in testicular and/or epididymal sperm maturation and/or potential processing in the mature cell during capacitation may be present. However, although impaired localization and/or assembly of the SLO1/SLO3/LRCC52 complex is a likely explanation for loss of function, detailed proteomic studies combined with high quality co-localization and imaging will be required to address this.</p><p>In this study, we assessed the presence and prevalence of abnormalities in membrane conductance and maintenance of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> in spermatozoa from 81 patients attending for IVF (normal in their semen characteristics, WHO, 2010) and ICSI treatment. In most cases, these spermatozoa had a <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and current profile similar to that seen in healthy volunteer donors, although there was greater variation in both outward conductance and <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>. This is consistent with a shift in channel regulation due to changes in spermatogenesis and/or epididymal maturation. In a surprisingly large number of patients, <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and/or conductance were significantly abnormal, including a subset (5&#x02013;10% of both IVF and ICSI patients) where currents were grossly abnormal. Where these abnormalities resulted in a strongly depolarized (+ve) <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>, the cells were functionally compromised. Overall, these data suggest that (i) impaired K<sup>+</sup> conductance and/or regulation of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> in spermatozoa is a relatively common feature both in ICSI patients and in men classified as suitable for IVF and (ii) such lesions, particularly when they cause loss or reversal of membrane polarization, may contribute to a significant loss of fertilizing potential. This knowledge could be helpful for the development of novel diagnostic tools to assess semen quality using membrane permeable voltage-sensitive dyes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/humrep/dew056/-/DC1" xlink:show="new">Supplementary data are available at http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/.</ext-link></p>
