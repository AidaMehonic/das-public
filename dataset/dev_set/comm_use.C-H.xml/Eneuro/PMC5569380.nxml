In contrast, the properties of the flanking CA2 pyramidal neurons (PNs), important for social memory, and lacking CA1-like plasticity, remain relatively understudied. In particular, little is known regarding the expression of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> (Kv) channels and the contribution of these channels to the distinct properties of intrinsic excitability, action potential (AP) waveform, firing patterns and neurotransmission between CA1 and CA2 PNs. In the present study, we used multiplex fluorescence immunolabeling of mouse brain sections, and whole-cell recordings in acute mouse brain slices, to define the role of heterogeneous expression of Kv2 family Kv channels in CA1 versus CA2 pyramidal cell excitability. Our results show that the somatodendritic delayed rectifier Kv channel subunits Kv2.1, Kv2.2, and their auxiliary subunit AMIGO-1 have region-specific differences in expression in PNs, with the highest expression levels in CA1, a sharp decrease at the CA1-CA2 boundary, and significantly reduced levels in CA2 neurons. PNs in CA1 exhibit a robust contribution of Guangxitoxin-1E-sensitive Kv2-based delayed rectifier current to AP shape and after-hyperpolarization potential (AHP) relative to that seen in CA2 PNs. Our results indicate that robust Kv2 channel expression confers a distinct pattern of intrinsic excitability to CA1 PNs, potentially contributing to their different roles in hippocampal network function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Kv2 channel</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>CA1</kwd><kwd>CA2</kwd><kwd>AMIGO-1</kwd><kwd>RGS14

Determining the molecular mechanisms that regulate excitability of CA1 versus CA2 PNs is important in understanding their distinct plasticity, and their different roles in spatial and contextual versus social memory, respectively. Here, we show that specific characteristics of action potential (AP) firing properties in CA1 versus CA2 PNs can be attributed to voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> (Kv)2 channels, with higher expression levels and functional contributions in CA1 versus CA2. Our results suggest that Kv2 channel expression is an important determinant of specific aspects of AP firing properties in CA1 versus CA2 PNs, and that regulation of membrane excitability by Kv2 channels may contribute to the robust synaptic plasticity of CA1 PNs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>Possibly the most studied neurons in the brain, CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs) receive and integrate input from area CA3 along their dendritic arbor, and then communicate information to cortical and subcortical regions. The CA1 region is a major component of the hippocampal tri-synaptic circuit and allows the formation of spatial and contextual memory. In contrast, the role of region CA2 has been more difficult to decipher. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies have demonstrated that CA2 PNs do not encode spatial information in the same way as CA3 and CA1 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mankin et al., 2015</xref>). CA2 PNs are necessary for social recognition memory (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Stevenson and Caldwell, 2014</xref>) and act to control hippocampal excitability on a global scale (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Boehringer et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, CA2 PNs form the crux of a hippocampal-wide network that encodes spatial information during immobility (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Kay et al., 2016</xref>). Molecular profiling studies have identified distinct mRNA expression patterns across the CA regions in the hippocampus, clearly demonstrating the sharp border that exists between CA1 and CA2 that is detectible with a growing number of molecular markers (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Talley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lein et al., 2005</xref>). However, little is known of the expression levels of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> (Kv) channels, the key determinants of intrinsic excitability, action potential (AP) wave form, firing patterns, and neurotransmission between CA1 and CA2 PNs.</p><p>The Kv2 family of Kv channels, which includes the Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 principal or &#x003b1; subunits, and the AMIGO-1 auxiliary subunit, are abundantly expressed in the soma, proximal dendrites and axon initial segment of many types of brain neurons (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Trimmer, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Maletic-Savatic et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kuja-Panula et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Rhodes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Mandikian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>). In the hippocampus, CA1 PNs express high levels of Kv2 channels (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Maletic-Savatic et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Rhodes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Speca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>), which underlie &#x0223c;60&#x02013;80% of the delayed rectifier current recorded from PN somata (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Murakoshi and Trimmer, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Bean, 2014</xref>). In CA1 PNs, studies using antisense oligonucleotide knockdown approaches (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2000</xref>) or employing the selective Kv2 blocking neurotoxin Guangxitoxin-1E or GxTX (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Bean, 2014</xref>) showed that Kv2 channels contribute to controlling the excitability of CA1 PNs. These channels, with their relatively slow activation kinetics (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2007</xref>), regulate repetitive firing, AP width and trough voltage after a spike. The regulation of membrane excitability by these channels likely contributes to the robust synaptic plasticity of CA1 PNs.</p><p>Clearly, regions CA1 and CA2 are distinct, with contrasting molecular compositions and roles in hippocampal function. However, many questions remain concerning the significance of the distinct molecular profiles across areas CA1 and CA2. Given the dynamic regulation of Kv2 channels, and their pertinence in disease (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Torkamani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Thiffault et al., 2015</xref>) and their influence on neuronal and behavioral excitability (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Speca et al., 2014</xref>), a detailed understanding of their expression across regions of the hippocampus, and how this impacts cellular excitability, would further our understanding of hippocampal function. In the present study we used antibodies against the CA2 PN marker RGS14, an accepted molecular marker for CA2 PNs (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>), and genetically encoded <italic>Amigo-2/Cre</italic> mice expressing GFP in CA2 PNs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>), with a panel of highly validated Kv2 channel subunit antibodies in multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry experiments on mouse brain sections to determine the cellular expression of Kv2 channel principal and auxiliary subunit polypeptides across hippocampal regions CA1 and CA2. We combined this with electrophysiological studies on the role of Kv2 channel function on AP characteristics in CA1 versus CA2 PNs by blocking Kv2 channels with GxTX, a selective blocker of Kv2 channels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3A"><title>Antibodies</title><p>See details of antibodies used on <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Antibodies used in this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antibody name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Species/isotype/immunogen</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Manufacturer information</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Concentration used</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AMIGO-1, anti-AMIGO-1 rabbit pAb</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Raised against aa 394&#x02013;492 of mouse AMIGO-1 (cytoplasmic C-terminus).</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trimmer Lab.

Linescans were 18 &#x000b5;m (28 pixels) thick, and data points reflected the mean intensity values (mean of 28 pixels) per area unit. Linescans were drawn across CA1 to CA2 to CA3 in stratum pyramidale (s.p.). Values from multiple immunolabels and of Hoechst dye were simultaneously measured from the same linescan. Background levels for individual labels were measured from no primary controls and mathematically subtracted from linescan values. Intensity values for each linescan and for individual antibody labels were normalized to their own average intensity in the CA region with the highest level of immunolabeling. Linescans from different brain sections (and from different animals) were aligned based on RGS14 labeling and the normalized values across different linescans were averaged. Mean fluorescence intensity values in high-magnification (63&#x000d7;) images were quantified by ROI selections. Individual neurons were identified by Hoechst staining. CA2 PNs were identified by RGS14 labeling. ROI selections were drawn in single optical sections, which show signal from only one neuronal layer in the Z plane. Each ROI was drawn around the Kv2-labeled area clearly seen in the periphery of the neurons using the &#x0201c;polygon selection tool&#x0201d; in ImageJ. Intensity values were normalized to the average value of CA1 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3G"><title>Electrophysiology slice preparation</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were housed and euthanized in accordance with Universit&#x000e9; Paris Descartes ethics committee approval.

Kv2.1 immunolabeling is highest in s.p., in accordance with its restricted subcellular localization on the soma, proximal dendrites and axon initial segment. The highest Kv2.1 immunolabeling intensity corresponds to region CA1, with a pronounced decrease at the CA1-CA2 boundary, as demarcated by the site of the sharp increase in RGS14 labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The lower immunolabeling levels of Kv2.1 in CA2 were preserved across CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

In our experiments, we found that the density of Hoechst nuclear labeling is indeed lower in CA2 compared to CA1. As such, it is possible that the differences in the overall intensity of immunolabeling for Kv2 channel subunits seen at the CA1-CA2 border is simply a reflection of the lower density of PNs in CA2, as opposed to lower expression of these Kv2 &#x003b1; and auxiliary subunits in individual PNs of region CA2. To address this, we next performed high-magnification imaging with optical sectioning to define the immunolabeling on a cell-by-cell basis, and determine differences in expression between RGS14 positive and negative neurons within the CA regions. As shown in the representative images depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, the RGS14 negative PNs in CA1 proper and at the CA1-CA2 boundary have the highest labeling intensity for Kv2.1, Kv2.2, and AMIGO-1, whereas RGS14 positive neurons within the CA1-CA2 boundary zone, and within CA2 proper, have relatively low levels of such immunolabeling.

That similar results were obtained with at least two monoclonal antibodies with independent non-overlapping binding sites on each subunit, and also with polyclonal antibody preparations, strongly supports that this immunolabeling reflects the levels of expression of the individual subunits in these neurons. The cellular pattern of immunolabeling obtained here is generally consistent with previously published immunolabeling results, and with <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization studies posted by the Allen Brain Atlas. However, our results provide higher resolution information that this change in Kv2 channel subunit expression occurs precisely at the CA1:CA2 boundary, which these other sources could not provide due to the lack of specific molecular definition of region CA2.</p><p>Consistent with these immunolabeling results is the overall lack of an effect of GxTX on AP characteristics in CA2 PNs, relative to the robust and diverse effects of this neurotoxin on APs in CA1 neurons. The results presented here, obtained from CA1 PNs in intact hippocampal slice preparations, are in good agreement with previous results from acutely dissociated CA1 neurons (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Bean, 2014</xref>). Our results demonstrate a prominent role for Kv2 channels in CA1 PNs, where they are highly expressed on the soma, proximal dendrites, and axon initial segment, in determining membrane excitability, and the shape and frequency of APs. In contrast, we show that unlike in CA1 PNs, APs in CA2 PNs lack any demonstrable response to GxTX treatment, consistent with the significantly reduced expression of Kv2 channels observed in these PNs relative to those in CA1. CA2 PNs are distinct in lacking the afterhyperpolarizing trough seen in CA1 neurons (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>), a characteristic that has been attributed to Kv2 channels (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Bean, 2014</xref>). The substantially reduced expression of Kv2 channels likely confers a distinct input-output relationship to CA2 neurons, that, when combined with their unique network connectivity, would underlie their fundamentally different function in hippocampal information processing.</p><p>Our experiments show that Kv2 currents clearly contribute to the AP width and AHP of CA1 PNs. Thus, in CA1 PNs, by controlling the AP width, these channels are likely acting to control neuronal excitability during periods of high activity by limiting calcium influx during AP firing, as has been demonstrated in hippocampal slice cultures treated with antisense oligonucleotides targeting Kv2.1 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2000</xref>). Presynaptic neurotransmitter release paired with AP firing is a central component of long-term potentiation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Magee and Johnston, 1997</xref>). By their contribution to the AHP, we postulate that Kv2 currents may be contributing to CA1 PN repetitive firing and induction of long-term plasticity, as indicated by intact acute slice recordings of the scaeffer-collateral-CA1 synapse in Kv2.1 knockout mice (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Speca et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, these channels both prevent hyperexcitability while simultaneously permitting plasticity in region CA1, a hippocampal area well established to central for memory formation and learning.</p><p>In contrast, it has been demonstrated by multiple groups that CA2 PNs are highly resistant to postsynaptic long-term potentiation (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>). While the consequence of this lack of plasticity in CA2 PNs is not fully understood, differences in intracellular signaling cascades (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) as well as calcium buffering (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Simons et al., 2009</xref>) have been proposed to underlie this unusual property. Furthermore, differences in expression of numerous ion channels, including the absence of Kv2 channels, gives CA2 PNs very different properties compared to neighboring CA1. For instance, CA2 PNs have more hyperpolarized membrane potential and much lower R<sub>M</sub> that CA1 PNs, likely due to the expression of voltage-gated and leak channels, making these cells less excitable than CA1 PNs in general. The integrative properties of CA2 PN dendrites have shown to be unique, allowing the propagation of distal dendritic input in a manner that is strikingly different from CA1 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Srinivas et al., 2017</xref>). It is clear that <italic>in vivo</italic>, CA2 PNs do not behave like CA1 PNs, with rapidly re-mapping place cells (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mankin et al., 2015</xref>) and the ability to encode location during immobility (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Kay et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, there remains much to be learned about CA2 PN physiology and function.</p><p>We also note that there is a gradient of Kv2.2 and AMIGO-1, but not Kv2.1, from low in the distal region of CA3 (adjacent to CA2) and progressively higher toward the proximal region of CA3 (closer to the dentate gyrus). The elevated expression of Kv2.2, but not Kv2.1, in proximal CA3 may confer on these neurons properties distinct from distal CA3 and CA2, which lack prominent Kv2 channel expression, and CA1, which expresses high levels of both Kv2.1 and Kv2.2. This may impact the plasticity of Kv2 channel function in these neurons, given the robust phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Kv2.1 but not Kv2.2 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>). Gradients in gene expression, connectivity and functionality across CA3 have been reported (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 2013</xref>). Several Kv channels, such as Kv3.1, Kv3.2, Kv4.3, Kv5.1, and Kv10.1 have been shown to have a gradient of expression across CA3 at the mRNA level (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Vega-Saenz de Miera, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>). The differences in ion channel expression across region CA3 presumably support the observed differences in intrinsic excitability and firing patterns in distal versus proximal CA3 PNs (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bragdon et al., 1986</xref>). Future studies employing GxTX may be useful to defining the specific role of the gradient of Kv2.2-containing delayed rectifier channels in these differences across region CA3, as shown here for the distinctions between PNs in regions CA1 and CA2.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Acknowledgements: Most of the antibodies used in this study are available from the UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility (neuromab.ucdavis.edu).</p></ack><ref-list content-type="nameDate"><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Bishop</surname>

Although the recommendations from those reviews to use additional KV2 blockers and provide a voltage clamp assessment of blocker effects on KV2 currents were not heeded, the provided correlative data is strong and the hesitancy to expend more effort on examining a current that is evidently absent in CA2 neurons is understandable. </p><p>In light of this, the reviewing editor can recommend that the manuscript be accepted without further review, provided that a revision addresses some additional minor clarifications/corrections (listed below).</p><p>1. There seems to be some confusion with respect to the repetitive firing data presented in Fig. 6, and described on p. 15. </p><p>First, the exemplar record of Fig. 6A shows that GxTX increased firing frequency in the CA1 neuron (i.e., the APs in the yellow trace are, consistently and increasingly, left-shifted relative to the corresponding AP in the black trace, at least until they fade out). Yet, the data are described in the text (p. 15) as demonstrating that "application of GxTX substantially decreased the AP firing frequency in CA1 PNs." </p><p>This characterization appears to derive from the analysis presented in Fig. 6D, but this analysis also seems to be confused. How does one calculate an instantaneous frequency for each AP? Instantaneous frequency is typically derived from the reciprocal of the interspike interval, and thus requires two APs (as described in Liu &#x00026; Bean, 2014, who used the first two spikes to calculate an initial firing rate during the step.) </p><p>So, in Fig. 6D, why does the normalized instantaneous frequency decrease more in GxTX through the pulse when in Fig. 6A the interspike intervals remain more closely spaced in GxTX (until the APs finally fade out)? </p><p>Moreover, the expectation is that a reduced AHP (more depolarized trough) would allow faster firing -- it would favor a shorter interspike interval, at least until progressive inactivation of sodium channels yields a fade-out. This is what the data in your exemplar trace indicates (Fig. 6A) ... but it is opposite of both the instantaneous frequency analysis (Fig. 6D) and the description in the text (p. 15). </p><p>This should be clarified. </p><p>2. The significance statement is overstated. It is not the case that "the differences in action potential firing properties in CA1 versus CA2 PNs can be attributed to Kv2 channels," at least not solely to Kv2 channels. Likewise, it is not possible to conclude that "Kv2 channel expression is the primary determinant of the distinct firing properties in CA1 versus CA2 PNs." These claims should be tempered. </p><p>3. I concur with the previous Reviewers point #9 regarding the awkward phrasing with the use of decrease, reduced, changes, etc. - there remain a few places in the manuscript where this should be corrected. </p><p>p. 12: "these patterns of immunolabeling were reflective of changes in expression levels ..." might better be "reflective of differences in expression levels" </p><p>"as opposed to a reduction in the expression of these Kv2 ..." to "as opposed to lower expression of these Kv2 ..." </p><p>"and determine changes in expression between RGS14 positive and negative neurons" to "and determine differences in expression between RGS14 positive and negative neurons" </p><p>p. 13: "Moreover, the CA2 boundary demarcated by GFP expression corresponds well to the region in which the changes in Kv2.1, Kv2.2 and AMIGO-1 immunolabeling differ across the CA regions." could instead say "Moreover, the CA2 boundary demarcated by GFP expression corresponds well to the region in which the differences in Kv2.1, Kv2.2 and AMIGO-1 immunolabeling are observed across the CA regions." </p><p>p. 14: "Our immunolabeling results indicate that the expression levels of Kv2 channel subunits are substantially reduced in CA2 PNs relative to those in CA1" to "Our immunolabeling results indicate that the expression levels of Kv2 channel subunits are substantially lower in CA2 PNs relative to those in CA1" </p><p>4.
