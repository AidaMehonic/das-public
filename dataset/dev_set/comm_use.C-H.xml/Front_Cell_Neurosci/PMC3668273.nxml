Multiple lines of evidence have indicated that a critical pathogenic factor causing PD is enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which reacts readily with polyunsaturated fatty acids to cause lipid peroxidation (LPO). LPO products have been shown to facilitate assembly of toxic &#x003b1;-syn oligomers in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Since DA is prone to autoxidation and cause ROS, it has been suggested that interactions among DA, LPO, and &#x003b1;-syn play an important role in neuronal loss in PD. However, the exact mechanism(s) remains unclear. We addressed this issue using a neuronal cell model which inducibly expresses human wild-type &#x003b1;-syn by the tetracycline off (Tet-Off) mechanism and stably expresses high levels of DA transporter. Under retinoic acid elicited neuronal differentiation, cells with or without overexpressing &#x003b1;-syn and with or without exposure to LPO inducer-arachidonic acid (AA), plus 0&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;M of DA were assessed for the levels of LPO, &#x003b1;-syn accumulation, cell viability, and autophagy. AA exposure elicited similar LPO levels in cells with and without &#x003b1;-syn overexpression, but significantly enhanced the accumulation of &#x003b1;-syn oligomers and monomers only in cultures with Tet-Off induction and decreased cell survival in a LPO-dependent manner. Surprisingly, DA at low concentrations (&#x0003c;50 &#x003bc;M) protected cells from AA cytotoxicity and &#x003b1;-syn accumulation. Such effects were attributed to the ability of DA to preserve autophagic-lysosomal function compromised by the AA exposure. At high concentrations (&#x0003e;100 &#x003bc;M), DA exposure enhanced the toxic effects of AA. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing biphasic effects of DA on neuronal survival and &#x003b1;-syn accumulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>&#x003b1;-synuclein</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>aggregation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="64"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) is characterized by accumulation of neuronal inclusions containing &#x003b1;-synuclein (&#x003b1;-syn), degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and deficiency of dopamine (DA) in substantia nigra and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Dauer and Przedborski, 2003</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence have indicated that enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a critical pathogenic factor causing PD and that ROS can be generated via autoxidation of DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Jenner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Fahn and Cohen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Lotharius and Brundin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Tieu et al., 2003</xref>). ROS react readily with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are enriched in brain phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Rapoport, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Whelan, 2008</xref>), to generate peroxyl radical and cause lipid peroxidation (LPO) via propagation and chain reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Young and McEneny, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Farooqui and Farooqui, 2011</xref>).

It has been reported that presence of LPO products such as 4-hydroxynonenal, 4-oxo-2-nonenal or oxidized DA can facilitate <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly of &#x003b1;-syn oligomers, but not that of &#x003b1;-syn filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Cappai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Qin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Nasstrom et al., 2009</xref>). There are also evidences suggesting a role of soluble oligomeric &#x003b1;-syn species in cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Winner et al., 2011</xref>). These aforementioned findings along with information derived from many other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Hattoria et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Ruiperez et al., 2010</xref>) highlight a likely role of DA and LPO in PD pathogenesis, hence it is important to investigate this issue further.</p><p>In present study, we used a neuronal cell model of PD to investigate interplays among DA, LPO, &#x003b1;-syn assembly and cell survival. The model, referred to as 3D5/DAT, was generated from stable transfection of 3D5 cells with human DA transporter (DAT) genes to increase DA uptake. Cells of 3D5 are derived from a human neuroblastoma cell line inducible to express human wild-type &#x003b1;-syn via the tetracycline off (Tet-Off) mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). While the expression of &#x003b1;-syn is inducible, expression of hDAT in 3D5/DAT cells is not. It has previously been demonstrated that 3D5 cells upon Tet-Off induction and neuronal differentiation via retinoic acid (RA) treatment are capable to accumulate small amounts of &#x003b1;-syn oligomers and this process has very little impacts on cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Ko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>). In current cell-based studies, we focused on examining cultures with and without (i) overexpressing &#x003b1;-syn, (ii) exposure to a LPO inducer arachidonic acid (AA), which is a major PUFA in the brain and (iii) treatment with DA. These cells were assessed as to the extent of LPO, &#x003b1;-syn accumulation, autophagy, and cell viability.</p><p>We found that induced &#x003b1;-syn expression had no effect on the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of LPO. However, AA treatment affected MDA levels in a time-dependent manner, regardless whether there was &#x003b1;-syn overexpression or not. Exposure of 3D5/DAT cells with induced &#x003b1;-syn to AA caused accumulation of &#x003b1;-syn oligomers and decrease of cell survival when compared to non-induced controls. These changes were accompanied with alteration of autophagy marker levels and that of lysosomal membrane permeability. Such impacts could be significantly reduced by co-treatment of cultures with DA at physiological concentration or rapamycin (Rapa) which is an autophagy inducer. Importantly, the co-treatment prevented cells from changes of lysosomal membrane permeability. Treatment of cells to DA at higher concentrations led to cell death and enhanced &#x003b1;-syn oligomer accumulation. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing biphasic effects of DA on neuronal cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>REAGENTS</title><p>Arachidonic acid, bovine serum albumin (BSA), DA, Rapa, wortmannin (WM), Trolox (TX), and Triacsin C (TC) were purchased from Sigma.

After treatment with or without AA for up to 60 h these cells were analyzed by LPO assay and western blotting. Similar to what was observed in 3D5/DAT cells without &#x003b1;-syn induction, significant increases of LPO were detected in samples from cultures that have been exposed to AA for 48 h or longer durations. The extents of LPO increase were comparable between the AA-treated cultures with and without &#x003b1;-syn induction. However, more &#x003b1;-syn accumulation were detected in cultures with AA treatment than without, and more in those with longer durations of AA exposure (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>). Such increase of &#x003b1;-syn accumulation was contributed not only by increasing the level of monomeric &#x003b1;-syn but also that of different sizes oligomeric &#x003b1;-syn species (&#x02265;33kDa;<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">C</xref></bold>). We noted that cultures with 60 h of AA treatment contained far more large sizes &#x003b1;-syn oligomers (&#x0003e;75 kDa) than those with shorter treatment, and some of the large oligomers were too large to enter the separation gel (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">C</xref></bold>). Moreover, small oligomers of size consistent with that of &#x003b1;-syn dimer (~30 kDa) were less abundant in cultures with 60 h of AA exposure than those with shorter periods of treatment. Such shifting of &#x003b1;-syn gel electrophoretic profiles indicates that the assembly of &#x003b1;-syn in these cultures is AA-elicited and time-dependent.

We speculated that the changes of LC3-II/GAPDH ratio may reflect decrease of autophagy flux via disturbance of lysosomes, since the treated cells have more &#x003b1;-syn accumulation (i.e., monomers in non-induced and monomers plus oligomers in induced), and &#x003b1;-syn can be degraded by lysosomal proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Sevlever et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Mak et al., 2010</xref>).

Although it remains uncertain if a certain pathway was affected before others, it is reasonably to consider that abnormalities displayed at different stages of PD likely reflect the cross-talks among different pathways. Oxidative stress has been placed as a key component in PD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Jenner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Fahn and Cohen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Tieu et al., 2003</xref>), since it is known to link ROS production to a variety of metabolic outcomes, including oxidative modification of proteins and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Danielson and Andersen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Radak et al., 2011</xref>), which in brain tissue are enriched in PUFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Rapoport, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Whelan, 2008</xref>). Polyunsaturated acyl chains of phospholipids or PUFAs such as AA, docosahexaenoic acid, and linoleic acid are highly susceptible to peroxidation and breakdown to form a variety of lipid-derived aldehydes and ketones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Frankel, 1984</xref>). In this regard, it has been reported that at very early stages of PD (stages 1 and 2), before the appearance of &#x003b1;-syn aggregates, neurons in substantia nigra display signs of oxidative damage to lipid, and this brain region at stage 3 displays punctate aggregates containing &#x003b1;-syn modified by oxidization among other types of posttranslational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Ferrer et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that modification of &#x003b1;-syn by LPO products (e.g., 4-hydroxynonenal) leads to<italic/>inhibition of &#x003b1;-syn fibrillization and formation of soluble oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Qin et al., 2007</xref>). Addition of 4-hydroxynonenal modified &#x003b1;-syn oligomers to neuronal cell cultures caused cell death, suggesting the oligomers are cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Qin et al., 2007</xref>). It has long been considered that a significant contributing factor rendering dopaminergic neurons more susceptible to degeneration than other neurons is the high susceptibility of DA to undergo autoxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Miyazaki and Asanuma, 2008</xref>). Cell-based studies have shown that increase the steady-state levels of DA can inhibit formation of &#x003b1;-syn aggregates and induce the formation of innocuous oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Yamakawa et al., 2010</xref>) and exposure to DA at non-physiological concentrations caused cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Gomez-Santos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Benchoua et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To understand further the role of lipid oxidation, DA and &#x003b1;-syn and their interactions in PD, we performed a series of studies using cultured cells of human origin generated in present studies. The cells, regarded as 3D5/DAT, are inducible to express human wild-type &#x003b1;-syn and express DAT stably. They displayed neuronal phenotype in response to RA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Ko et al., 2008</xref>). We employed AA exposure as a mean to promote LPO in these cells and have demonstrated that the magnitude of LPO is AA exposure time- (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>) and concentration-dependent as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Canuto et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Schonberg et al., 2006</xref>). In our cultures, a minimum 2 days of exposure to 250 &#x003bc;M AA was required to cause a significant elevation of LPO levels (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>), and longer durations of exposure were required to achieve the same effect if lower AA concentrations were used (data not shown). This is due to the fact that LPO is a free radical-mediated chain reaction, involving initiation, propagation, and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Young and McEneny, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Farooqui and Farooqui, 2011</xref>) and that products of LPO are highly reactive to make covalent modifications of macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Grimsrud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Gueraud et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Although it has been reported that overexpression of &#x003b1;-syn can increase intracellular ROS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Junn and Mouradian, 2002</xref>) in other cell types, our previous studies have shown that the level of ROS in 3D5 cells is not significantly affected by &#x003b1;-syn overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, during the course of AA treatment (i.e., up to 72 h), cells with &#x003b1;-syn induction displayed LPO at the extent comparable to that detected in corresponding samples without the induction. Therefore, that &#x003b1;-syn overexpression has no influence on LPO in present study. We also demonstrated that AA exposure can cause caspase 3 activation as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Vento et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Saitoh et al., 2003</xref>). The increase of active caspase 3 by AA treatment is time-dependent and the pattern of changes parallels that of AA-elicited LPO, showing marked and sustained elevation in cultures treated for 60 h or longer. Moreover, cells with &#x003b1;-syn induction contained more active caspase 3 and exhibited less viability than their non-induced counterparts. The changes of caspase activation and cell viability probably are linked to LPO, since they were significantly reduced in cells co-treated either with AA plus LPO scavenger (TX) or AA plus its uptake inhibitor (TC; <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). It is worth noting that cells expressing more &#x003b1;-syn are more responsive to activation of caspase 3 and to decrease of viability elicited by AA exposure, which is consistent with previous studies that &#x003b1;-syn overexpression increases the sensitivity of neuronal cells to different insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Orth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Nieto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bisaglia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2013</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying that &#x003b1;-syn modulates the level of active caspase 3 in AA-treated cultures is unclear. Since the increase of active caspase 3 is concomitant with that of LPO and oligomeric &#x003b1;-syn, it is possible that in present study LPO induced &#x003b1;-syn oligomers have &#x003b1;-syn dose-dependent toxicity, thus trigger the activation of caspase 3 in a stronger manner than LPO alone, and render cells bearing more &#x003b1;-syn more vulnerable to LPO insults. The exact mechanism remains further investigations.</p><p>Another consequence of AA exposure to cells with &#x003b1;-syn induction is enhanced accumulation of &#x003b1;-syn monomers and different sizes oligomers. Such responses were also detected in cells without the induction, but the magnitude is much smaller and more apparent for monomers (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). The AA-elicited &#x003b1;-syn oligomers are detectable by SDS-PAGE, hence are deemed as SDS-resistant. Accumulation of these oligomers are results of either acceleration of &#x003b1;-syn assembly and/or decrease of its degradation. The latter possibility was tested by examining the levels of LC3-II/GAPDH, p-mTOR versus total mTOR, and the integrity of lysosome membranes. Although western blot studies showed that AA treatment affects the ratio of LC3-II/GAPDH and that of p-mTOR/total mTOR, these changes do not guarantee autophagic degradation, since protein degradation via autophagy-lysosome system requires fusion of autophagosomes to functional lysosomes. LysoTracker labeling of 3D5/DAT cells demonstrated that the integrity of lysosomes was compromised by AA treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>). Therefore, AA-elicited &#x003b1;-syn accumulation is a result of decreased protein degradation and changes of autophagy markers detected in the AA-treated cells reflects likely the inhibition of autophagic degradation of LC3-II (i.e., accumulation of autophagosomes).</p><p>We have demonstrated that addition of DA at physiological concentrations to AA-treated 3D5/DAT cells leads to not only a marked decrease of oligomeric &#x003b1;-syn, decrease of LPO and active caspase 3, but also increase of cell viability. Opposite results were obtained from similar analysis of cells with exposure to DA at higher concentration. Together the results indicate that DA treatment has biphasic effects; pro and against cell survival at low and high concentrations, respectively. How DA exerts the opposite effects observed in our studies is an issue of interest. We explored the possibility that at low concentrations DA treatment may activate autophagy to degrade &#x003b1;-syn and other proteins susceptible to modification by LPO products, some which can be cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Camandola et al., 2000</xref>). This is supported by data from studies of cells with or without co-treatment with Rapa or WM (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>). Rapa exposure has the same impacts as low DA on blocking the changes elicited by AA, whereas WM exposure countered the impacts of DA. Similar to what was demonstrated in the AA-treated, cells with exposure to DA alone or DA plus AA have a higher ratio of LC3-II/GAPDH and lower ratio of p-mTOR/total mTOR than controls. However, it was revealed by LysoTracker labeling that those treated with 50 &#x003bc;M DA, or 50 &#x003bc;M DA plus AA are comparable to untreated controls or those treated with Rapa or WM in respect to lysosome integrity, suggesting that at low concentration DA can protect cells from AA-induced cytotoxicity by maintaining normal lysosomal functions. It is worth noting that increase the steady-state levels of DA via overexpression of tyrosine hydroxylase has been shown to inhibit formation of &#x003b1;-syn aggregates in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing A53T mutant or wild-type &#x003b1;-syn without causing additional cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Mazzulli et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>A previous study had exposed rat primary embryonic striatal neurons to different concentration of DA (100, 200, 300, 400, 500 &#x003bc;M) and found that only those exposing to more than 200 &#x003bc;M DA showed loss of cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Benchoua et al., 2008</xref>). Later, another study showed that exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to 100 or 500 &#x003bc;M DA resulted in a DA dose-dependent increase of LC3-II, and cell death occurred only in 500 &#x003bc;M DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Gimenez-Xavier et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with those studies, our results also showed DA dose-dependent increase of LC3-II and that only high concentrations of DA (&#x0003e;300 &#x003bc;M) cause decrease of viability in cells co-exposed to AA. The association between LC3-II increase, protein clearance and cell apoptosis is an issue of interest. As we discussed earlier, and reported previously by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Mizushima and Yoshimori, 2007</xref>), increase of LC3-II/LC3-I alone are not sufficient to support whether autophagy activation leading to successful clearance of proteins/subcellular organelles has occurred or not. Based on our LysoTracker labeling, DA at high concentrations could not protect cells from AA-elicited damages of lysosomal membranes but exacerbate the damage to some extent. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that enhanced &#x003b1;-syn accumulation and reduced cell viability observed in our cultures exposing to high concentration of DA plus AA are due to further blockage of lysosomal degradation of &#x003b1;-syn and other proteins. However, we noted that cells treated with high concentrations of DA alone were comparable to those treated with low DA with respect to LysoTracker labeling intensity and cathepsin D activities (unpublished data). Therefore, additional mechanisms are likely involved in caspase activation/cell death heightened by treatment of cells to AA plus high concentration of DA.</p><p>Exposure to DA at high concentrations has previously been reported to cause (i) impairment of proteasomes, (ii) increase in hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha, (HIF-1) (iii) accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and proteins regulated by HIF-1 alpha and involved in apoptosis and/or autophagy (e.g., p53, Puma and Bnip3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Keller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Gomez-Santos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Benchoua et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Gimenez-Xavier et al., 2009</xref>). Abnormal protein accumulation, in turn, can affect cell survival via activation of caspases to result in apoptotic/autophagic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Qiu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Gomez-Santos et al., 2003</xref>). This is supported by our findings of increased levels of active caspase 3 cells treated with high concentrations of DA and decrease of this form of caspase in those treated with low concentrations of DA. We do not know what mechanisms are involved to maintain lysosomal membrane integrity upon exposure to low concentrations of DA. This issue will be pursued in future investigation.</p><p>Besides preserving lysosome membrane integrity, low concentration of DA may protect AA-elicited cytotoxicity via other mechanisms. In this regard it has been reported that binding of agonists to D2/D3 receptors can lead to induction of bcl2 and suppression of cytochrome c release from mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Kihara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Park et al., 2011</xref>). However, in our cell model, the possibility of this pathway playing a significant role in protecting cells from AA toxicity by low concentration of DA is low. This is in view of the results obtained from our recent studies, in which an additional transfectant derived from 3D5 cells (i.e., 3D5 cells transfected with pVgRXR and pIND-DAT sequentially) was used. Expression of &#x003b1;-syn and DAT in this new transfectant is inducible by removing tetracycline and adding muristerone, respectively. This transfectant differs from 3D5/DAT, which expresses &#x003b1;-syn and DAT with and without induction, respectively. We found that upon induction of &#x003b1;-syn and DAT expression this new transfectant responded to AA and low concentration of DA in a manner comparable to that of 3D5/DAT cells. We also found that in the absence of induced DAT expression the presence of low DA offered no protective effects on AA toxicity. These findings suggest that DA uptake via DAT rather than its binding to D2/D3 receptors is critical for DA&#x02019;s protective effects.</p><p>Regardless, our results support the possibility that physiological levels of DA has role in maintaining autophagy-lysosomal function. It is worth noting that Rapa has been reported to protect against neuronal death in PD animal models generated from treatment with neurotoxins such MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine), and to prevent<sc>L</sc>-DOPA (<sc>L</sc>-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine)-induced dyskinesia in 6-OHDA lesioned animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Malagelada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Feyder et al., 2011</xref>). Together with the findings from our cell-based studies, highlight the potential of mTOR signaling cascade as a promising target for development of PD therapeutics.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the National Institute of Health (P50-NS40256), the Mayo Foundation (Yen), and the Mangurian&#x02019;s Foundation (Yen).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Benchoua</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Trioulier</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Diguet</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Malgorn</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gaillard</surname><given-names>M.
