Both animal model and epidemiological investigations have indicated that these impairments in a majority of GW veterans are linked to exposures to chemicals such as pyridostigmine bromide (PB, an antinerve gas drug), permethrin (PM, an insecticide) and DEET (a mosquito repellant) encountered during the Persian Gulf War-1. Our previous study in a rat model has shown that combined exposures to low doses of GWI-related (GWIR) chemicals PB, PM, and DEET with or without 5-min of restraint stress (a mild stress paradigm) causes hippocampus-dependent spatial memory dysfunction in a water maze test (WMT) and increased depressive-like behavior in a forced swim test (FST). In this study, using a larger cohort of rats exposed to GWIR-chemicals and stress, we investigated whether the memory deficiency identified earlier in a WMT is reproducible with an alternative and stress free hippocampus-dependent memory test such as the object location test (OLT). We also ascertained the possible co-existence of hippocampus-independent memory dysfunction using a novel object recognition test (NORT), and alterations in mood function with additional tests for motivation and depression. Our results provide new evidence that exposure to low doses of GWIR-chemicals and mild stress for 4 weeks causes deficits in hippocampus-dependent object location memory and perirhinal cortex-dependent novel object recognition memory. An open field test performed prior to other behavioral analyses revealed that memory impairments were not associated with increased anxiety or deficits in general motor ability. However, behavioral tests for mood function such as a voluntary physical exercise paradigm and a novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT) demonstrated decreased motivation levels and depression. Thus, exposure to GWIR-chemicals and stress causes both hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent memory impairments as well as mood dysfunction in a rat model.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>Gulf War illness</kwd><kwd>hippocampus dysfunction</kwd><kwd>novelty suppressed feeding test</kwd><kwd>open field test</kwd><kwd>object location test</kwd><kwd>object recognition test</kwd><kwd>voluntary exercise</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="8184"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gulf War illness (GWI) afflicts ~30% of the 700,000 military personnel who served in the Persian Gulf War-1 (PGW-1). Central nervous system (CNS) impairments are the most ubiquitous among the various symptoms of GWI (Amato et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Haley et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2000a</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Golomb, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Parihar et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These mainly comprise memory dysfunction, depression, concentration problems and insomnia (Haley et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2000a</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Steele, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Odegard et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Although the exact causes of GWI are yet to be ascertained, it is widely believed that these enduring clinical symptoms are linked to a combination of exposures encountered by the service personnel during the PGW-1. These include significant exposures to the antinerve gas drug pyridostigmine bromide (PB), pesticides such as permethrin (PM, an insecticide), and N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET, an insect repellant) and war related stress. Exposure to PB occurred because veterans who were stationed in the battlefield areas (i.e., stationed within a mile of an exploding SCUD missile) believed to have consumed pyridostigmine bromide (PB) pills daily during the war for variable periods, as an antidote against the potential exposure to chemical weapons such as organophosphate nerve agents (Steele et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Exposure to pesticides such as PM and DEET occurred because preparations for the PGW-1 comprised measures to offset the threat associated with infectious diseases transmitted via insects and ticks such as the use of pesticides for the area protection and uniforms and application of insect repellants on the skin.</p><p>Thus, veterans who served in the PGW-1 were significantly exposed to pesticide sprays and fogs used to kill flying insects, and insect repellants (Haley and Kurt, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; van Haaren et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Institute of Medicine, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) in the period of their PB intake and war. Furthermore, a report by the research advisory committee (RAC) on GWI implies that the overall prevalence of GWI is greater in veterans who used higher amounts of pesticides than veterans who had limited exposure to pesticides during the PGW-1 (Binns et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In some veterans, higher level of exposure to pesticides was also associated with a higher consumption of PB pills (Schumm et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Abdullah et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Other hypothesized causes of GWI include exposure to chemical weapons (for those veterans who were stationed near the chemical weapon depot demolitions), depleted uranium and oil well fires etc. However, based on both animal model and epidemiological studies, it is widely believed that GWI in a significant fraction of PGW-1 veterans is a consequence of synergistic interaction of PB with pesticides such as PM and DEET (Friedman et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Hyams et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Everson et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Binns et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Abdullah et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Torres-Altoro et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Steele et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ojo et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Considering the above, analyses of the long-term effects of such combined exposures using animal models have received significant attention (Abdel-Rahman et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Abdullah et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Our recent study in a rat model has shown that combined exposure to low doses of GWI-related (GWIR) chemicals such as PB, PM, and DEET (for 4 weeks) with or without stress (5 min of restraint stress) is detrimental for hippocampus function (Parihar et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Such exposures caused spatial memory dysfunction in a water maze test (WMT) and increased depressive-like behavior in a forced swim test (FST). Interestingly, these memory and mood deficits were linked with several pathological changes in the hippocampus, which comprise chronic inflammation typified by the presence of ED-1+ activated microglial cells and hypertrophy of astrocytes, persistently decreased neurogenesis (a substrate important for hippocampal-dependent cognitive and mood function) and some loss of neurons in hippocampal principal cell layers (Parihar et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In the current study, by performing both object location test (OLT) and novel object recognition test (NORT), we examined whether a larger cohort of animals exposed to GWIR-chemicals would display deficits for both hippocampus-dependent memory (measured through an OLT) and hippocampus-independent or partially hippocampus-dependent memory function (measured through an NORT). Furthermore, we determined whether increased depressive-like behavior observed earlier with an FST would be detectable in alternative tests for mood function such as voluntary exercise paradigm involving housing of rats in cages fitted with running wheels and novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Three-months old Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN).

Following an inter-trial interval of 60 min, third trial was performed for 5 min through placement of the rat in the center of the same open field box with one of the objects remaining in the same location as in trial 2 and the second object moved to a new location in the open field box (i.e., the testing phase of OLT, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

The apparatus was cleaned with 70% alcohol and air-dried prior to the commencement of each trial for every rat. Data such as times spent in exploring the object moved to a novel place, the object remaining in the familiar place, and total time spent in the object exploration were measured.

Anxiety-related behavior was measured by the degree to which the rat avoided entering the central zone of the open field. Comparison of multiple parameters (such as the latency to the first entry into central zone, number of entries into the central zone; dwell time in sides and corners) demonstrated that GWI-rats did not exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior, in comparison to naive control rats (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;E</xref>).

Additional studies revealed that these memory impairments were associated with decreased motivation levels for voluntary physical exercise as well as depression but not anxiety or deficits in general motor ability.</p><p>Our earlier study has shown that similar exposure to low doses of GWIR-chemicals and stress results in hippocampus-dependent spatial memory dysfunction in rats when measured through a WMT (Parihar et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). As WMT causes some amount of stress to rats (as a consequence of 28 swimming trials over a period of 7 days), we pondered whether memory deficits observed in WMT be reproducible with other hippocampus-dependent cognitive tests that are considered relatively stress free. To resolve this, we examined a larger cohort of animals with OLT at 3 months after their exposure regimen in a stress-free environment in this study. Each rat first explored two identical objects in the acquisition phase of the OLT. An hour later, the rat explored the objects again with one of the objects moved to a new location. Naive rats spent more time in exploring the moved object than the object that remained in the same position as per expectation, which confirmed their ability for remembering which spatial locations have or have not been engaged earlier (Warburton et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, GWI-rats showed no preference for the moved object as they spent nearly equivalent amounts of time with the object in a novel place and the object in the familiar place, which confirmed that these rats have object location memory dysfunction. Previous lesion studies have demonstrated that positive functioning of this task critically requires the hippocampus but not the perirhinal cortex or the medial prefrontal cortex (Ennaceur et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Bussey et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Barker and Warburton, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Warburton et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This is consistent with the well-accepted notion that the hippocampus supports a cognitive map of the external world and that the hippocampus is part of a memory system that stores information about places in the organism's environment, their spatial relations, and the existence of specific objects in specific places (O'Keefe and Conway, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>; Manns and Eichenbaum, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). From this perspective, the findings confirm that animals exposed to low doses of GWIR-related chemicals and stress indeed exhibit hippocampus-dependent memory dysfunction. This could be due to several alterations in the hippocampus that were discovered in our previous study such as greatly decreased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, inflammation in the form of hypertrophied astrocytes and activated microglial cells, and partial loss of principal neurons in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus (Parihar et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This is because, adequate amounts of hippocampal neurogenesis is widely believed to be important for making new memories (van Praag et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Deng et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Parihar et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and partial neurodegeneration and inflammation can interfere with hippocampus function (Krishnadas and Cavanagh, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kohman and Rhodes, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>It is of great interest to note that the hippocampus dependent memory impairment observed in our rat model is consistent with the hippocampus dysfunction noted in veterans with GWI. Initially, a large number of veterans with GWI have self-reported cognitive deficits and memory problems. Following this, MR spectroscopy and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) analyses in veterans with GWI have suggested hippocampus dysfunction (Haley et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2000a</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Menon et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Furthermore, hippocampal dysfunction in veterans with GWI has been confirmed with measures of left and right hippocampal function assessed through arterial spin labeling, which involved intravenous infusions of physostigmine and measurement of the regional cerebral blood flow in hippocampi (Li et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). More importantly, a recent study using a face-name associative recall test (an objective measure of memory directly linked to hippocampus function) in association with measurements through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) demonstrated memory deficits in ill GW veterans (Odegard et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In this study, GW veterans with or without illness completed a face-name memory paradigm for which they were to connect two distinct pieces of data such as faces and names (Odegard et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). They were shown the studied faces afterward and queried to ascertain if a face had been allied with a name at study and whether they could recall the name if it was associated with a particular face. The fMRI data showed that performance on the memory test was directly related to the amount of activation in the left hippocampus observed during study (Odegard et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether GWI-rats also exhibit memory impairments that are not dependent on the hippocampus, we examined these rats for object recognition memory function using another stress free test. For this, we employed an NORT comprising exploration of two identical objects in the acquisition phase and comparison of the exploration of a familiar and a novel object an hour later in the test phase. This test does not involve the hippocampus but critically requires the integrity of the perirhinal cortex (Bussey et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Langston et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Naive rats spent more time in exploring the novel object than the familiar object, which confirmed their ability for object recognition memory. However, GWI-rats showed no preference for the novel object as they spent nearly equivalent amounts of time with the novel and familiar objects, implying that these rats have object recognition memory dysfunction. These results are different from our previous study where GWI-rats demonstrated normal object recognition memory function when minimal inter-trial interval (5 min) was maintained between the acquisition and test phases. This suggests that GWI-rats display deficits for long-term object recognition memory function. This is likely due to alterations in the function of the perirhinal cortex (such as the expression of plasticity associated with recognition memory), as studies have shown that changes in the NMDA receptor neurotransmission in the perirhinal cortex can impair object recognition memory (Griffiths et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Warburton et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Hence, studies on changes in the structure and function of the perirhinal cortex will be needed in the future to recognize mechanisms underlying object recognition memory dysfunction in GWI-rats. While the human perirhinal cortex (Brodman areas 35 and 36) involved in both visual perception and memory (Murray et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) has not been specifically examined in veterans with GWI, a study suggests general cortical atrophy and baseline working memory compensation in the basal ganglia of a subset of veterans with GWI (Rayhan et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>We also examined whether object location and object recognition memory deficits were associated with anxiety or changes in motivation levels for voluntary physical exercise and depression. Analyses of various parameters in a 10-min OFT did not show increased anxiety in GWI-rats. Furthermore, in both OLT and NORT, GWI-rats traveled distances and displayed velocities that are highly comparable to naive control animals. These results suggest that exposure to GWIR-chemicals did not induce anxiety. These OFT results are however different from our previous findings in a 5-min elevated plus maze test (EPMT) where animals treated with GWIR-chemicals and stress exhibited signs of anxiety in the form of reduced entries to open arms and reduced dwell time in open arms (Parihar et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This discrepancy likely reflects differences in the duration of test (5 min in EPMT vs. 10 min in OFT) and the less complex environment encountered in an OFT. Thus, GWI-rats do not seem to exhibit a major anxiety disorder but show a tendency for increased fear when they encounter a complex environment such as in an EPMT. However, these animals clearly showed decreased motivation for leisure activity (a sign of depression), which was evidenced in this study through significantly reduced motivation for voluntary exercise using running wheels incorporated in their cages. Moreover, depression analyses using an NSFT clearly revealed increased depressive-like behavior in these rats, which is also consistent with our earlier findings using an FST (Parihar et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Depression is likely also linked to some of the alterations observed in the hippocampus in our previous study such as greatly waned neurogenesis, inflammation, partial loss of principal neurons and reduced volume (Parihar et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Particularly, reduced hippocampal neurogenesis may be having a major role in the pathophysiology of depression in this model, as multiple previous studies have showed evidence that mood function depends on the extent of hippocampal neurogenesis (Santarelli et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Snyder et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Eisch and Petrik, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kheirbek et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>)</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study reinforce that exposure to GWIR-chemicals and stress causes both hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent memory dysfunction as well as mood impairments. From this viewpoint, this animal model recapitulates the major CNS symptoms seen in veterans with GWI, as memory and mood deficits being the most common of symptoms (Odegard et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Smith et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, this is an ideal animal model for testing drugs that have promise for treating GWI. Considering the underlying hippocampal pathology identified in our earlier study (Parihar et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), future studies need to examine drugs that have promise for enhancing memory and mood function through increased neurogenesis and reducing inflammation in the hippocampus.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>Bharathi Hattiangady and Vikas Mishra contributed equally to this work.
