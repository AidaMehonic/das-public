Recently, polysaccharide based hydrogels have become especially attractive as matrices for the repair and regeneration of a wide variety of tissues and organs. The incorporation of inorganic minerals as hydroxyapatite nanoparticles can modulate the performance of the scaffolds with potential applications in tissue engineering. The aim of this study was to verify the osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) cultured on a carboxymethyl cellulose&#x02014;hydroxyapatite hybrid hydrogel. Human DPSCs were seeded on carboxymethyl cellulose&#x02014;hydroxyapatite hybrid hydrogel and on carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel for 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 days. Cell viability assay and ultramorphological analysis were carried out to evaluate biocompatibility and cell adhesion. Real Time PCR was carried out to demonstrate the expression of osteogenic and odontogenic markers. Results showed a good adhesion and viability in cells cultured on carboxymethyl cellulose&#x02014;hydroxyapatite hybrid hydrogel, while a low adhesion and viability was observed in cells cultured on carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel. Real Time PCR data demonstrated a temporal up-regulation of osteogenic and odontogenic markers in dental pulp stem cells cultured on carboxymethyl cellulose&#x02014;hydroxyapatite hybrid hydrogel. In conclusion, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data confirms the ability of DPSCs to differentiate toward osteogenic and odontogenic lineages in presence of a carboxymethyl cellulose&#x02014;hydroxyapatite hybrid hydrogel. Taken together, our results provide evidence that DPSCs and carboxymethyl cellulose&#x02014;hydroxyapatite hybrid hydrogel could be considered promising candidates for dental pulp complex and periodontal tissue engineering.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>osteogenic differentiation</kwd><kwd>odontogenic differentiation</kwd><kwd>dental pulp stem cells</kwd><kwd>hydrogel</kwd><kwd>tissue engineering</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Fondazione del Monte di Bologna e Ravenna<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004740</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="6977"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The goal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is to improve or restore the functions of diseased tissues and organs. Tissue engineering strategies require main elements such as stem cells, scaffold or matrix, and growth factors (Kabir et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to renew themselves for long periods through cell division and, under certain physiological or experimental conditions, they can be induced to become specialized cells (Verma et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Potdar and Jethmalani, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Five types of MSCs have been isolated from dental tissues and demonstrated to have high proliferative and multilineage differentiation properties: dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs; Gronthos et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Tirino et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Pisciotta et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; La Noce et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs; Miura et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs; Seo et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), dental follicle progenitor stem cells (DFPCs; Morsczeck et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs; Sonoyama et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>Dental pulp is considered a rich source of DPSCs, suitable for tissue engineering applications (La Noce et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). It has been shown that DPSCs can be differentiated by modulation with growth factors, transcriptional factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and receptor molecules into different cell types including odontoblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, cardiomyocytes, neuron cells, adipocytes, corneal epithelial cells, melanoma cells, and insulin secreting Beta cells (Pisciotta et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; La Noce et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Paino et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Potdar and Jethmalani, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>DPSCs isolated from dental pulp co-express typical MSCs markers such as CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD271, and STRO-1, while negative markers are CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR (La Noce et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Verma et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Potdar and Jethmalani, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Pisciotta et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) recently demonstrated the co-existence of two subpopulations of adult stem cells derived from human DPSCs, one of mesodermal origin and a second of neural crest derivation, increasing the potential application of DPSCs in regenerative medicine. However, there is no specific or strict marker characterizing DPSCs, which are considered a heterogeneous population.</p><p>Recent attention has been focused on the utilization of DPSCs in tissue engineering (d'Aquino et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>; Verma et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Several scaffolds have been used to promote 3-D tissue formation and studies have demonstrated that DPSCs show good adherence and bone tissue formation on microconcavity surface textures (Graziano et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Naddeo et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In oro-maxillo-facial bone repair DPSCs have been seeded on collagen sponge scaffolds, producing an optimal biocomplex for regeneration of DSPCs for bone repair (d'Aquino et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>). A 3-year follow-up demonstrated the synthesis of adult bone tissue with good vascularization (Giuliani et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), showing the powerful application of DPSCs in periodontal and dental pulp tissue engineering.</p><p>In tissues engineering strategies, the choice of an appropriate scaffold is a crucial step (Galler et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Hydrogels have been employed as an emerging and promising tool in regenerative medicine but also as an injectable filler material (Varma et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Vashist and Ahmad, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A variety of natural and synthetic polymers have been used to fabricate hydrogels. Collagen, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, fibrin, fibronectin, alginate, agarose, chitosan, and silk have been the most commonly used natural polymers (Geckil et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Cellulose is one of the most ubiquitous and abundant of biopolymers produced in the biosphere. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine researchers have shown an interest in cellulose because it has a low density and an excellent biodegradability associated with low ecotoxicological risks (Domingues et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). One of the main drawbacks of cellulose-based hydrogels is the lack of good mechanical proprieties (Pasqui et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a semisynthetic natural polymer obtained from the carboxymethylation of natural cellulose, named carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was developed with hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals to generate a new hybrid hydrogel for bone tissue engineering (Pasqui et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Although the chemical and mechanical proprieties were well described (Pasqui et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), data on the biological performance of CMC-HA hydrogels on stem cells differentiation is lacking.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the <italic>in vitro</italic> osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs seeded on a CMC-HA hydrogel. DPSCs were seeded on a CMC-HA hydrogel in presence of osteogenic factors for a period of up to 21 days. Biocompatibility was measured by MTT assay, while electron microscopy analyses were carried out to demonstrate cell adhesion on the scaffold surface.</p><p>The markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), type I collagen and osteonectin (SPARC) were chosen for the examination of osteogenic differentiation, while the markers dentin matrix protein I (DMP1), and dentin sialophospho protein (DSPP) were chosen for the examination of odontogenic differentiation. Gene expression was tested by Real Time PCR. Results were compared to DPSCs seeded on CMC-based hydrogels and to DPSCs seeded on 2D system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Scaffold synthesis and characterization</title><p>CMC-based hydrogels without and with hydroxyapatite (HA) were synthesized and characterized as already described in Pasqui et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Briefly, the crosslinking agent 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) was added to the mixture at a molar ratio of 0.5 with respect to the moles of carboxylic acid of the polymers and to the activating agents 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethyl-amino)propyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) moles. The molar ratio of EDC and NHS mole is 1 to 1. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 4.75 by the addition of HCl 1M solution and the reaction was allowed to go on under stirring overnight at room temperature. Once formed, the hydrogel was purified by dipping it in water for 4&#x02013;5 days until no traces of free EDC or NHS were revealed by UV spectrophotometry and finally freeze-dried. To load HA inside CMC hydrogel, an exactly weighted amount of freeze-dried hydrogel was dipped in a five solutions containing increasing amounts of HA in a range from 0.5 to 2.5 mg mL. Above this concentration, HA crystals form aggregates which precipitate. The hydrogel was let to swell under moderate stirring for 48 h that is a sufficient time to allow it to reach the maximum swelling degree. Finally, the hydrogel was removed from the solution washed with deionized water until no trace of HA was revealed in the washing solution and freeze-dried again.</p></sec><sec><title>Human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) isolation</title><p>DPSCs were obtained from healthy permanent premolars extracted during orthodontic treatment, under informed consent. Cells were isolated from dental pulp as described in a previous study (Teti et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).

These results suggest that DPSCs can be successfully utilized for dental pulp complex and periodontal tissue engineering.</p><p>In such strategies, the interaction between stem cells and the material applied as scaffold plays a critical role in the generation of a cell-friendly microenvironment, which must be conducive to the regeneration of dental structures (Conde et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The two categories of materials that are most commonly used in tissue engineering are synthetic polymers such as poly(lactic) acid (PLA) and poly(glycolic) acid (PGA) (Galler et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and matrices derived from biological sources such as reconstituted collagen (Falconi et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Focaroli et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ivanovski et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In the last years, hydrogel systems were proposed as new biomaterials for minimally invasive surgery, repair of bone defects with irregular shape, such as periodontal defects, filling materials and <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery of bioactive signals or cells (Barbucci et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Pasqui et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Cellulose based hydrogels are well-known for their low toxicity, high biocompatibility, and low degradation rates. The main drawback is the lack of good mechanical proprieties. The presence of HA crystals in the scaffold offers suitable mechanical proprieties, and roughness which can increase cell adhesion (Geckil et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Pasqui et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The aim of this study was to evaluate the osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs cultured on a CMC-HA hydrogel and to verify the biological proprieties of this biomaterial which can subsequently be utilized in tissue regeneration. To our knowledge, the present experimental study is the first report demonstrating a favorable biological performance of CMC-HA hydrogels toward stem cell osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation.</p><p>Our cell viability assay of DPSCs seeded on CMC-HA showed a good biocompatibility of the material in agreement with previous studies on cellulose-based scaffolds (Pasqui et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The MTT assay in particular demonstrated a slight increase in cell proliferation the first day of culture and a peak of proliferation at day 7, suggesting a period of adaption for the cells on scaffold surface prior to the proliferation phase. This behavior was already demonstrated for mesenchymal stem cells separated by bone marrow (Teti et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and cultured on collagen-based scaffold (Focaroli et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). On the other end, cells seeded on CMC based hydrogel, although showing an increased metabolic activity up to day 7, had values of cell viability always lower than CMC-HA samples. Considering that the number of cells seeded on both materials was initially the same, we concluded that in CMC samples there was a weaker adhesion of cells to the scaffold surface and less proliferation during the time of incubation. These findings reflect one of the common problems associated with non-human polysaccharide based hydrogels (carboxymethylcellulose, chitosan, alginates, etc.) utilized for tissue engineering applications, characterized by a lack of bioactivity, which usually limits cell adhesion to biomaterials and further tissue integration (Shin et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Jing et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). One approach to promote polysaccharide biomaterials interactions with surrounding tissue has been to tether cell-binding peptides to the biomaterial, through physical or chemical modification methods, to provide biological cues to mimic cell&#x02013;extracellular matrix protein interactions (Jing et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Polysaccharide based hydrogels, designed for bone tissue engineering, need stronger mechanical proprieties to regenerate hard tissues (Pasqui et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mattei et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Michel et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). To this aim, it has been demonstrated that the combination of hydroxyapatite with natural or synthetic hydrogels improves bioactivity, osteoinductivity, and osteoconductivity (Michel et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>A previous investigation reports that the CMC-HA hybrid hydrogel showed the presence of HA crystal homogenously distributed inside and on the hydrogel surface, improving inherent mechanical and adhesive proprieties (Pasqui et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>HR-SEM analysis confirmed a poor adhesion of DPSCs on the CMC surface. At the end of day 21, no cells were detected on the hydrogel surface. This result is apparently in contrast with cell viability data, where at day 7 a peak of cell viability was observed. We speculate that during the preparation of the sample for electron microscopy analysis, cells were lost due to a weak adhesion on the CMC scaffold.</p><p>HR-SEM images of the CMC-HA scaffold showed a good adhesion of cells after 1 day of culture. By the end of day 21, the cells covered the scaffold surface, showing a fibroblast-like morphology and several secretory vesicles on the cellular membrane, suggesting intense protein synthesis mainly connected with the differentiation process (Venugopal et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Teti et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). TEM images demonstrated the presence of extracellular matrix fibrils resembling type I collagen protein at day 14 and 21, in agreement with the commitment of MSCs toward the osteogenic and odontogenic lineage (Riccio et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Teti et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>To fully confirm the osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs cultured on CMC-HA hydrogel, a Real Time PCR analysis was carried out to test mRNA expression of osteogenic markers such as ALP, RUNX2, COL1A1, and SPARC. RUNX2 is a transcription factor involved in osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis. It has been shown to affect the expression of type I collagen and SPARC by binding to the promoters of these genes. RUNX2 and COL1A1 are known to be early markers of osteoblastic differentiation while SPARC is involved in initiating mineralization and promoting mineral crystal formation during bone formation. ALP appears to be intimately related to pre-osseous cellular metabolism and to the elaboration of a calcifying bone matrix (Siffert, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1951</xref>).</p><p>The data obtained showed the expected expression profiles of the osteoblast phenotype. Results showed an up-regulation of all osteogenic markers after day 14 and 21, compared to control DPSCs. These data are in agreement with the temporal gene expression demonstrated during osteogenesis (Kulterer et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Raggatt and Partridge, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Fakhry et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). An up-regulation of RUNX2 was evident during the whole period of differentiation. COL1A1 reached a maximum of expression on day 21 in agreement with TEM images that showed the presence of extracellular fibrillary structures, resembling type I collagen protein. Also SPARC showed a nearly constant, up-regulated expression level with a peak on day 21 of differentiation.</p><p>To demonstrate odontogenic differentiation, the mRNA expression of DMP1 and DSPP genes was investigated by Real Time PCR. DMP1 plays crucial roles in the formation of dentin mineralized tissues (Ye et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). DSPP is a large protein which subsequently undergoes cleavage to generate two products: dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) (Yamakoshi et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). DPP is thought to play a role during the nucleation of calcium phosphate while DSP has little or no effect on mineralization; its real function remains unclear (Yamakoshi et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Our data demonstrated an upregulation of both odontogenic markers during the process of differentiation reaching peak levels at D14 and D21, corresponding to the phase of deposition of extracellular matrix and mineralization (Kulterer et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrated that the CMC-HA hybrid hydrogel has suitable proprieties in supporting DPSCs adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation. This novel biomaterial could be a promising candidate for periodontal and dental pulp tissue engineering.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Each author substantially contributed to experimental procedures.
