is a persistently active PKC isoform proposed to maintain late-LTP and long-term memory. But late-LTP and memory are maintained without PKM&#x003b6; in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice. Two hypotheses can account for these findings. First, PKM&#x003b6; is unimportant for LTP or memory. Second, PKM&#x003b6; is essential for late-LTP and long-term memory in wild-type mice, and PKM&#x003b6;-null mice recruit compensatory mechanisms. We find that whereas PKM&#x003b6; persistently increases in LTP maintenance in wild-type mice, PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;, a gene-product closely related to PKM&#x003b6;, persistently increases in LTP maintenance in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice. Using a pharmacogenetic approach, we find PKM&#x003b6;-antisense in hippocampus blocks late-LTP and spatial long-term memory in wild-type mice, but not in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice without the target mRNA. Conversely, a PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;-antagonist disrupts late-LTP and spatial memory in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice but not in wild-type mice. Thus, whereas PKM&#x003b6; is essential for wild-type LTP and long-term memory, persistent PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; activation compensates for PKM&#x003b6; loss in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

The formation of memories is believed to depend on the strengthening of connections between neurons. During learning, neurons produce an enzyme called PKMzeta (or PKM&#x003b6;), which is thought to be responsible for maintaining the newly strengthened connections. Inhibitors of PKMzeta, such as a drug called ZIP, disrupt long-term memories. This suggests that the brain may be like a computer hard disc in that its stored information &#x02014; its memories &#x02014; could be erased.</p><p>However, recent experiments on genetically engineered mice have thrown the role of PKMzeta into question. Knockout mice that lack the gene for PKMzeta can still strengthen connections between neurons and can still learn and remember. Moreover, ZIP still works to reverse the strengthening and to erase long-term memories. This indicates that ZIP can act on something other than the PKMzeta enzyme. These results have led many neuroscientists to doubt that PKMzeta has anything to do with memory.</p><p>Yet there are two possible explanations for the normal memory in PKMzeta knockout mice. First, PKMzeta is not required for memory, so getting rid of it has no effect. Second, PKMzeta is essential for long-term memory in <italic>normal</italic> mice. However, knockout mice recruit a back-up mechanism for long-term memory storage, which is also sensitive to the effects of ZIP.</p><p>To test these possibilities, Tsokas et al. used a modified piece of DNA that prevents neurons with the gene for PKMzeta from producing the enzyme. The DNA blocked memory formation in normal mice, consistent with a role for PKMzeta in memory. However, it had no effect in knockout mice &#x02014; the DNA had nothing to work on. This suggests that another molecule does indeed act as a back-up for PKMzeta in these animals. Further experiments revealed that an enzyme closely related to PKMzeta, called PKCiota/lambda (PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;), substitutes for PKMzeta during memory storage in the knockout mice.</p><p>These findings restore PKMzeta to its early promise. They show that PKMzeta is crucial for long-term memory in normal mice, but that something as important as memory storage has a back-up mechanism should PKMzeta fail. Future work may reveal when and how this back-up becomes engaged.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

Induction is thought to rely solely on post-translational modifications. Maintenance requires new protein synthesis soon after strong synaptic stimulation or learning, and these newly synthesized proteins are believed to sustain the synaptic potentiation or behavioral modification (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kandel and Schwartz, 1982</xref>). Although numerous signal transduction molecules are important for LTP and long-term memory, most have been implicated in induction, with many participating in either the initial transient potentiation or the mechanisms for upregulating new protein synthesis (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>). In contrast, few molecules have been implicated in maintenance. Such a maintenance molecule would be both: 1) a product of de&#x000a0;novo protein synthesis sufficient to enhance synaptic transmission and 2) a necessary component of the mechanism sustaining synaptic potentiation and long-term memory, as shown by&#x000a0;inhibition of the molecule reversing sustained&#x000a0;synaptic potentiation and erasing long-term memory.</p><p>One hypothesis for a molecular mechanism of maintenance involves the persistent increase in an autonomously active PKC isoform, PKM&#x003b6; (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sacktor, 2011</xref>). LTP and long-term memory maintenance may depend upon the function of PKM&#x003b6; because data suggest the kinase possesses the two essential properties of a maintenance molecule. First, PKM&#x003b6; is produced in LTP by new protein synthesis and is sufficient to potentiate synaptic transmission. PKM&#x003b6; is generated from a PKM&#x003b6; mRNA, but this mRNA is translationally repressed in the basal state of neurons (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez et al., 2003</xref>). During LTP, strong afferent synaptic stimulation derepresses the mRNA and rapidly increases the de&#x000a0;novo synthesis of PKM&#x003b6; (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez et al., 2003</xref>). The newly synthesized kinase, unlike most other protein kinases, is autonomously active without the requirement for second messenger stimulation (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sacktor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez et al., 2003</xref>), and the autonomous activity of PKM&#x003b6; is sufficient to enhance synaptic transmission (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2008</xref>). Second, multiple inhibitors of PKM&#x003b6;&#x000a0;and a&#x000a0;dominant-negative mutated form of&#x000a0;PKM&#x003b6;&#x000a0;reverse established LTP maintenance or disrupt long-term memory storage (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Serrano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pastalkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Shema et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recently, this proposed function of PKM&#x003b6; has been challenged by new findings that LTP and long-term memory appear normal in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Volk et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the PKM&#x003b6;-inhibitor ZIP, which disrupts the maintenance of LTP and long-term memory in wild-type animals, disrupts these same processes in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Volk et al., 2013</xref>). Two hypotheses can account for these findings (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Frankland and Josselyn, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Matt and Hell, 2013</xref>). First, in a straightforward hypothesis, PKM&#x003b6; is unnecessary for LTP or long-term memory, and therefore genetically deleting PKM&#x003b6; has no effect on these processes (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Volk et al., 2013</xref>). Second, PKM&#x003b6; is essential for late-LTP and long-term memory in wild-type mice, and compensatory mechanisms emerge in the mutant mice to substitute for PKM&#x003b6;, which are also inhibited by ZIP. Here, we used a pharmacogenetic approach to distinguish between the 'PKM&#x003b6; is unnecessary hypothesis' and the 'PKM&#x003b6; is compensated hypothesis'.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZIP reverses late-LTP maintenance in both wild-type and PKM&#x003b6;-null mice and blocks synaptic potentiation produced by PKM&#x003b6; and PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;</title><p>We first confirmed the previously published findings that late-LTP appears similar in PKM&#x003b6;-null and wild-type mice, and that ZIP (5 &#x000b5;M) applied to the bath 3&#x02009;hr after tetanization reverses late-LTP in both wild-type mice (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Serrano et al., 2005</xref>) and PKM&#x003b6;-null mice (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Volk et al., 2013</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

After 4 days of training, the PKM&#x003b6;-null mice acquire the normal avoidance response moving to the quadrant furthest from the shock.<fig id="fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14846.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>With a weaker training protocol, PKM&#x003b6;-null mice show inefficient spatial learning and deficits in spatial memory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Above, schematic diagram of 5-day training protocol.

Whereas the asymptote for wild-type mice is over 500 s, it is about half that for PKM&#x003b6;-null mice. The main effects and interactions are all significant (genotype: F<sub>1,255</sub> = 22.4, p = 3.67 X 10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup>,&#x000a0;&#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.053; trial: F<sub>16,255</sub> = 7.3, p = 2.35 X 10<sup>&#x02013;14</sup>, &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.28; interaction: F<sub>16,255</sub> = 1.8, p = 0.031, &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.068). Post-hoc tests do not distinguish PKM&#x003b6;-null memory on any trial from the pretraining and first training trials when there is no avoidance memory, whereas wild-type memory is significantly better as early as day 3, trial 3, and is superior to pretraining and PKM&#x003b6;-null estimates of 1-day memory from day 4 through the final retention test on day 6.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

After entering the shock zone, shocks are repeated every 1.5 s until the mouse leaves the zone. The ability to escape shock is estimated by counting the number of shocks the mouse received before it left the shock zone. Within the first training trial both the wild-type and PKM&#x003b6;-null mice learn to leave the shock zone so they only rarely receive more than 1 shock. This indicates good and equivalent ability to escape in the two groups throughout the training. These observations are confirmed by a significant genotype X trial interaction (F<sub>16,255</sub> = 4.8, p = 1.54 X 10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup>, &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.11). Post-hoc test detects that for both genotypes during pretraining with shock off, the number of shocks the mice would have received for each shock zone entrance (had the shock been on) is greater than during all the training sessions with shock on, as expected. During retention with the shock off, post-hoc test detects that&#x000a0;the PKM&#x003b6;-null animals would have received more shocks for each entrance into the shock zone than the wild-type mice. This difference is consistent with worse retention of avoidance memory in the PKM&#x003b6;-null mice and may indicate that the place avoidance memory is less persistent in the PKM&#x003b6;-null mice because it rapidly extinguishes (n&#x02019;s = 10).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

But a second hypothesis that could account for these data is that the mechanisms of LTP and long-term memory in wild-type and PKM&#x003b6;-null mice are not the same, and that PKM&#x003b6; is essential for these processes in wild-type mice and compensatory mechanisms are recruited in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice. We used a pharmacogenetic approach to distinguish between these hypotheses. ZIP and chelerythrine are PKM&#x003b6;-inhibitors but cannot easily be used in a pharmacogenetic approach because they can block the action of both PKM&#x003b6; and PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C&#x02013;E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref>). But when &#x003b6;- and &#x003b9;/&#x003bb;-selective inhibitors are examined, experiments reveal a double dissociation between the mechanisms of LTP and spatial long-term memory in PKM&#x003b6;-null and wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Thus, the data indicate that the mechanisms of LTP and spatial long-term memory in wild-type and PKM&#x003b6;-null mice are not the same, and the PKM&#x003b6; is unnecessary hypothesis by which the function of PKM&#x003b6; in wild-type mice can be inferred from the results obtained from PKM&#x003b6;-null mice is erroneous.</p><p>To selectively block the action of PKM&#x003b6; we took advantage of the specific nucleotide sequence of the PKM&#x003b6;-mRNA translation start site to develop PKM&#x003b6;-antisense oligodeoxynucleotides that suppress the activity-dependent de&#x000a0;novo synthesis of PKM&#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast to applications of inhibitors of PKM&#x003b6;&#x02019;s phosphotransferase activity that disrupt LTP and long-term memory after PKM&#x003b6; has already been synthesized (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Serrano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pastalkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Shema et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2011</xref>), we applied the PKM&#x003b6;-antisense during the critical temporal window of new protein synthesis during late-LTP and long-term memory formation when general protein synthesis inhibitors such as anisomycin are effective (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Frey and Morris, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Squire, 1984</xref>), and when PKM&#x003b6; is formed (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Osten et al., 1996</xref>). Acute application of the PKM&#x003b6;-antisense suppresses the new synthesis of PKM&#x003b6; and blocks late-LTP without reducing basal levels of the kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the crucial pool of PKM&#x003b6; protein sustaining synaptic potentiation in wild-type mice is synthesized de&#x000a0;novo in response to tetanization, rather than through the recruitment of pre-existing PKM&#x003b6; that had been synthesized before the tetanus.</p><p>To examine the mechanism maintaining late-LTP in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice, we focused on the kinase most closely related to PKM&#x003b6;, the other ZIP-sensitive atypical PKC, PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;. We found that whereas the increase in PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; after tetanization is transient in wild-type mice (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Osten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kelly et al., 2007</xref>), the increase in PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; persists in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In wild-type mice, PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; is important for early-LTP, and if PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; is inhibited at the time of afferent synaptic tetanization, neither early- nor late-LTP is formed (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;-null mice, which can only be partially compensated by PKC&#x003b6;, are embryonically lethal (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Seidl et al., 2013</xref>), and therefore studies of LTP using null mutations in which both atypical PKCs are completely eliminated are not feasible. Therefore, to test for a possible role of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; in LTP maintenance, we acutely suppressed the activity of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; after late-LTP and spatial long-term memory had been established. We used ICAP that selectively blocks PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; and not &#x003b6; kinase activities and which was developed based upon data from the crystal structure of the PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; catalytic domain (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pillai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sajan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). ICAP is designed to convert in cells to a compound that targets and binds to a docking site present in the PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; catalytic domain, but not in the very closely related PKC/PKM&#x003b6; catalytic domain, thus competing for binding of substrate proteins to &#x003b9;/&#x003bb; and not &#x003b6; (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pillai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sajan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;-inhibitor disrupts LTP maintenance and established long-term memory in the PKM&#x003b6;-null mice but not in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). But there is little information on ICAP on other kinases. Therefore, it is possible that ICAP may block the action of other molecules that may contribute to the maintenance of late-LTP and long-term memory in the PKM&#x003b6;-null mice (e.g. PKC&#x003b2;I, which also increases in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although off-target effects of ICAP are thus possible, nonetheless, the specificity of the agent in reversing LTP and spatial memory maintenance in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice and not in wild-type mice demonstrates that the mechanisms of maintenance in the two mouse genotypes are distinct and is predicted by the PKM&#x003b6;-compensation hypothesis.</p><p>The effects of ICAP on LTP maintenance only in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>) are thus consistent with the effects of ZIP on LTP in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Volk et al., 2013</xref>), because ZIP blocks the synaptic potentiation produced by both atypical PKCs, PKM&#x003b6; and PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). ZIP does not block the ability of the conventional and novel PKCs to mediate synaptic potentiation, indicating selectivity of the inhibitor towards atypical PKC isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1A</xref>). Specificity of ZIP toward atypical PKCs is further supported by evidence that ZIP&#x02019;s effects on LTP reversal and memory disruption in wild-type animals are completely blocked by preventing the reversal of PKM&#x003b6;&#x02019;s action on AMPAR-trafficking, indicating the absence of additional, off-target effects of ZIP in brain slices or in vivo (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Migues et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Pauli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Evuarherhe et al., 2014</xref>). These results conflict with the non-specific toxic effects of ZIP reported on in vitro cultured neurons or at high concentrations in slices (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sadeh et al., 2015</xref>). We observed, however, that ZIP causes no membrane perturbation at the lower doses used to block atypical PKCs, but not conventional/novel PKCs, and to specifically reverse potentiated, but not basal synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1B</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>How PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; transforms from a transiently increasing kinase in wild-type mice into a persistently increasing kinase in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice is not known, but likely involves additional compensatory mechanisms that sustain PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;&#x02019;s synthesis or decrease its degradation during LTP. A possible role for new synthesis of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; in PKM&#x003b6;-null-LTP is consistent with data that a&#x000a0;general protein synthesis inhibitor blocks the formation of late-LTP in PKM&#x003b6;-null mice (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Volk et al., 2013</xref>). Our results suggest the possibility that in wild-type mice PKM&#x003b6; suppresses the persistent increase of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; and that in the PKM&#x003b6;-null mice without this repression the increase of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; is sustained. PKM&#x003b6; and PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; compete for protein binding partners in developing neurons, suggesting that the loss of PKM&#x003b6; may allow for increased binding of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; to these proteins that might augment its stability and function (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2013</xref>). Whereas PKM&#x003b6;-null mice produce compensatory increases in PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 1A</xref>), the acute suppression of PKM&#x003b6; synthesis by antisense does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref>). Conditional PKM&#x003b6; knockdown mice, which show LTP like PKM&#x003b6;-null mice (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Volk et al., 2013</xref>), have not yet been examined for compensation by PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; or other molecules. Like the antisense, shRNA knockdown of PKM&#x003b6; has been found not to induce compensation by PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;, and to disrupt both late-LTP and long-term memory formation (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, further work will be required to determine when and how the loss of PKM&#x003b6; induces compensation by PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; or other PKCs.</p><p>Persistently increased atypical PKC activity by either PKM&#x003b6; or PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; may thus be a common molecular mechanism for maintaining late-LTP and spatial long-term memory in wild-type and PKM&#x003b6;-null mice, but when the cognitive demands of memory tasks increase, differences in performance emerge. When active place avoidance is made more difficult to acquire, for the first few days of conditioning wild-type mice explore the arena to find the safest location to avoid the shock, but PKM&#x003b6;-null mice avoid in the least safe position adjacent to the shock zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). After several more days of training, the PKM&#x003b6;-null mice switch to the wild-type strategy, but nonetheless perform poorly compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>). These differences in conditioned behavior may be a sign that the PKM&#x003b6;-null mice are defective in learning and memory or in integrating information about the relative safety of multiple areas of the arena. Likewise, during unreinforced novel object placement tasks, both mice with and without PKM&#x003b6; remember a single object-location association discrimination, but when the number of object location-association discriminations is increased to two, wild-type mice remember well, but PKM&#x003b6;-null mice express no memory for the learned information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that some of the differences in memory expression between wild-type and PKM&#x003b6;-null mice could be due to the fundamental molecular differences between PKM&#x003b6; and PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;. In contrast to the second messenger-independent PKM&#x003b6;, PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; can respond to second messengers that might be generated by short-term experiences (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Akimoto et al., 1994</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, in tasks with high cognitive demand, wild-type animals that express both isoforms can use PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; and PKM&#x003b6; for separate functions&#x02014;PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; for encoding information about short-term experiences, and PKM&#x003b6; for encoding information derived from these short-term experiences to be stored in long-term memory. But when PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; is used for both short-term memory and as a 'back-up' mechanism for long-term memory in the PKM&#x003b6;-null mice, its continued responsiveness to second messengers produced by short-term experiences may interfere with its function in long-term memory. For example, during active place avoidance, when PKM&#x003b6;-null mice attempt to find the safest location in an arena, information from one recently visited place might interfere with the integration of information from multiple places required for forming the optimal avoidance strategy. Likewise, in novel object placement, short-term memories of recently visited single object locations may suppress the encoding of multiple object-place associations in a single scheme. Further study of PKM&#x003b6;-null mutant mice might thus reveal fundamental insights into how PKM&#x003b6; encodes and stores information in long-term memory under physiological conditions in normal animals.</p><boxed-text id="B1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14846.019</object-id><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>Does PKM&#x003b6; play a role in maintaining long-term memories for a lifetime?</title></caption><p>The relationship between the persistent increased activity of PKM&#x003b6; and the persistent changes in synaptic morphology proposed to sustain long-term memory for a lifetime is an important question for future research. The persistent action of PKM&#x003b6; could function to launch or to sustain for a period the structural changes such as new synaptic connections (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), which once established become independent of PKM&#x003b6;. Many of the remote long-term memories lasting a lifetime are thought to be stored in neocortex. Therefore, this hypothesis could be tested experimentally by examining when a long-term memory that can be erased by PKM&#x003b6; inhibition in neocortex becomes resistant to this inhibition. So far, PKM&#x003b6;-dependence has been tested for up to 1-3 months. In the published experiments on remote memory in neocortex, intracranial injections of ZIP disrupt 1-month-old fear memories in visual, auditory, and olfactory cortices (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sacco and Sacchetti, 2010</xref>), and 3-month-old conditioned taste aversion memories in insular cortex (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Shema et al., 2009</xref>). Future studies should examine even older memories.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

Retention testing was a 10&#x02009;min trial without shock on the 6th day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Novelty-preference object spatial memory tests</title><p>Unreinforced hippocampus-dependent long-term memory was tested using adaptations of the object/context mismatch, the object/place mismatch, and the novel object location tests of novelty-preference (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mumby et al., 1999</xref>).&#x000a0;The behavioral task, protocol, and analysis are described in more detail at Bio-protocol (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lesburgu&#x000e8;res et al., 2017</xref>). Three open plastic boxes (42 x 42 x 20 cm) were placed at the center of the experimental room. The visual appearance of each box was unique and customized with different patterns on three of the four walls to make distinct spatial contexts, denoted A, B, and C (green, yellow, blue, respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The fourth wall was transparent and faced south to provide orientation cues. Unique objects (toys, flasks, jars) were placed 5 cm away from the walls and were fixed to the floor. The apparatus, boxes, and objects were cleaned with 70% ethanol between subjects to eliminate odor cues. A video tracking system (Tracker, Bio-Signal Group, Acton, MA) monitored and recorded the exploratory activity of the animals for offline analysis.</p><p>Each day, the mice were placed in the experimental room 30&#x02009;min before beginning the behavioral experiments. Each mouse was trained and tested in the object/context mismatch and the object/place mismatch tasks first, followed by the object-location task. Each task had three phases: pretraining, training, and the retention test. Pretraining (Day 1): the animals were allowed to explore each environment for 10&#x02009;min with no objects present. Training (Days 2&#x02013;4): the mice were allowed to explore a pair of environments, Contexts A and B, each during two 5&#x000a0;min trials/day, separated by a 1&#x000a0;hr intertrial interval. This allowed the mice to learn the spatial arrangement of the four objects in each box. Retention testing (Days 5 and 6): retention of spatial memory was evaluated on subsequent days by the object/context mismatch and the object/place mismatch tests. In the object/context mismatch test, two of the four objects from one context replace two of the objects in the other context, whereas in the object/place mismatch test, the positions of two objects were exchanged within one context. Each mouse was allowed to explore the altered environment for 3&#x02009;min, and the time spent exploring each object was recorded. On day 5, an hour after the retention test, the mice received additional training (5&#x02009;min exploration in contexts A and B with the original arrangement of objects). This additional training was intended to avoid extinction that could be induced by the retention test. The second retention test was on day 6, to test the mismatch task that was not tested on day 5. The order of the retention tests on days 5 and 6, the order of exposure to the boxes during training, the objects and the places were all counterbalanced between the animals and groups. Novel location test pretraining (Day 7): the mice explored the third environment, Context C, for 10&#x02009;min. Novel location test training (Day 8): two objects were placed in this environment, and the mice explored for 5&#x02009;min. During three 5&#x000a0;min training sessions, with 1&#x000a0;hr intertrial intervals, the mice could learn the locations of the pair of objects. Novel location retention test (Day 9): one object was relocated to a novel unoccupied place, and the time spent exploring each object was recorded. The relocated object, the location, and the specific environment were counterbalanced between animals and genotypes.</p><p>Offline analysis of the video identified exploration when the mouse&#x02019;s nose was &#x0003c;2 cm away and oriented toward the object. Memory performance was quantified using a discrimination index calculated as the absolute difference in time spent exploring the changed (i.e. incorrect, misplaced, or relocated) and the unchanged objects divided by the total time spent exploring all the objects. Good memory retention corresponds to a positive discrimination index, which reflects that the animal spent more time exploring the incorrect (object/context mismatch), displaced (object/place mismatch), or relocated (object-location) objects compared to the objects that were not changed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>Sample sizes vary for the different experimental approaches (biochemistry, in vitro intracellular current and extracellular field potential physiology, and behavior). The PKM&#x003b6; is unnecessary and the PKM&#x003b6; is compensated hypotheses predict all-or-none effects in the experiments, and this provided a basis for sample size estimates. Power analyses were performed using G*Power Version 3.0.6 with &#x003b1; = 0.05 and &#x003b2; = 0.8 and large effect sizes of 1.5&#x02013;2.0. The effect size estimates were based on prior studies that demonstrated essentially all-or-none effects of PKM&#x003b6; inhibition on the biochemical, physiological, and behavioral assays used here (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sacktor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Osten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kelly et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pastalkova et al., 2006</xref>). Two-population Student&#x02019;s t tests were performed to compare protein levels in the PKM&#x003b6;-null and wild-type mice. For LTP experiments the responses to test stimuli were averaged across 5 min for statistical comparisons. Paired Student&#x02019;s t tests were used to compare the change in the potentiated response at time points at the beginning and end of drug application. Multi-factor comparisons were performed using ANOVA with repeated measures, as appropriate. The degrees of freedom for the critical t values of the t tests and the F values of the ANOVAs are reported as subscripts. Post-hoc multiple comparisons were performed by Newman-Keuls tests as appropriate. Statistical significance was accepted at p&#x0003c;0.05. Effect sizes for binary comparisons and one-way ANOVAs are reported as Cohen's d and as &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> for two-way ANOVA effects.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="funding-information"><title>Funding Information</title><p>This paper was supported by the following grants:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source>

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Richard Morris, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Both reviewers were very supportive of the manuscript and requested only very minor revisions and clarifications. Specifically, please clarify in the revised manuscript your view of the issue raised by Reviewer 1 as their "main concern" and address the statistical issue raised by Reviewer 2.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I am so very pleased to have read this manuscript submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> as I have been following the PKM&#x003b6; story closely, I am not alone in doing so, and I feel sure that a large number of people will wish to read and cite a published version of this manuscript. This is &#x02013; surely &#x02013; important work. My reading of the manuscript reveals some questions, which I will come to, but my sense is that the key experiments have been conducted to test the idea that PKM&#x003b6; is compensated by another atypical PKC in PKM&#x003b6; null mice, and that this mediates late-LTP and long term memory in such genetically modified mice. The work involves the use of a non-discriminating drug (ZIP), specific antisense molecules, and another compound that targets the compensating PKC&#x003b9;. And the manuscript is beautifully written and accompanied by excellent figures.</p><p>My main concern</p><p>Over 20 years, Dr Sacktor has been building a story about identifying the likely molecular mechanism of long-term memory. The driving concept behind this is stated clearly in the first paragraph of the Introduction in which it is asserted that the hypothesis of a molecule implicated in maintenance has specific experimental predictions. I fear that the senior author's view on this is <italic>not</italic> shared by others as a third possibility is not considered &#x02013; namely that a molecule implicated in maintenance, while to be sure not contributing to initial memory formation, might not be sustained throughout the lifetime of a memory. To the contrary, it may trigger structural changes mediated by other molecules, and then depart the scene and no longer be involved. These structural changes would then be recycled during protein turnover in some way (but that is a separate albeit related problem in memory). An analogy might be helpful here. Consider a space rocket already in space that is circling the earth and is to be sent to the moon. For a brief period, the thrusters are activated and the rocket escapes earth's gravity and speeds up. It is on its way to the moon. The engines are stopped and the rocket keeps going. Should we look for the 'molecules' that sustain its motion towards the moon, akin to maintaining a memory as in Sacktor's argument? Or do we recognise that Newton's Laws of Motion distinguish acceleration and velocity and recognise that nothing is needed to sustain velocity in space? The molecules that make memory retention possible could, like the engines on a rocket, be activated only briefly.</p><p>The key findings of the manuscript</p><p>In any event, while not sharing exactly Sacktor's perspective, I am wholly persuaded by the impressive data that his group have secured over the years to the effect that PKM&#x003b6; is an important memory molecule. Unfortunately, the story was seriously dented by the publication in Nature in 2013 of two papers establishing normal LTP and normal long-term memory (LTM) in PKM&#x003b6; knockout mice. These papers were widely discussed and the general 'backchat' is that they had demolished Sacktor's story. But 'backchat' is not always to be relied upon &#x02013; as this manuscript now so beautifully demonstrates.</p><p>Sacktor now comes back in this manuscript with convincing evidence that a different atypical PKC, called PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; (I believe), is upregulated in the absence of PKM&#x003b6; and may take over some of its functions. In PKM&#x003b6; null mice, ZIP continues to be effective in reducing late-LTP but it may be that this happens because ZIP, while previously thought to be specific to PKM&#x003b6; also has an effect on PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;.</p><p>The way this new body of work takes us further is by first developing, and then using, a very specific antisense molecule targeting the translation start site of PKM&#x003b6;. The prediction is that this should successfully affect late-LTP in wild-type mice but not in PKM&#x003b6; null mice. This prediction is upheld (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and validated through appropriate biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The next step was to monitor the temporal expression of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; after LTP induction. Nicely, it increases transiently in wild-type mice (in which the upregulation of PKM&#x003b6; is of course doing the work), but it is increased for very much longer (&#x0003e;3&#x02009;hrs) in PKM&#x003b6; knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The group went on to test a molecule ICAP that affects PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; selectively and establish that its application reverses late-LTP in PKM&#x003b6; null mice but not in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This leaves the issue of why PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; is upregulated for longer, a point made in Discussion with sensible remarks accompanying.</p><p>Behavioural studies then become the focus with the demonstration using a place avoidance task first developed in the Czech Republic that PKM&#x003b6;-antisense successfully disrupts LTM in wild-type mice but not in PKM&#x003b6; null mice. Conversely, ICAP blocks LTM in PKM&#x003b6; null mice in which such memory is presumed to be mediated, in part, by the compensatory PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; molecule. Last, some data are presented showing in behavioural studies that the compensation is not 'perfect' and that subtle differences in strategy can be seen between wild-type and PKM&#x003b6; null mice in their initial learning of the place avoidance task when somewhat less aggressive training is deployed.</p><p>I have described the results in some detail as they seem to me to constitute a serious test of two conflicting hypotheses &#x02013; as presented at the outset of manuscript &#x02013; to the effect that either (1) PKM&#x003b6; plays no role in long-term maintenance (Huganir), or (2) that it does so in wild-type mice, but its absence is effectively compensated in PKM&#x003b6; gene knock-out mice.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>I strongly recommend publication &#x02013; essentially as the manuscript is written. I wondered if Sacktor should add that one reason for compensation may be because PKM&#x003b6; is so important for memory that an organism cannot afford to be without the necessary mechanism if the gene were to malfunction &#x02013; but perhaps that is too speculative.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The study by Tsokas et al. is a remarkably thorough and interesting test of the hypothesis that PKM&#x003b6;, an atypical protein kinase C isoform, mediates protein synthesis-dependent late-phase LTP in wild type mice. The authors are responding to a finding that mice, in which PKM&#x003b6; is knocked out by homologous recombination, still show late LTP and that LTP is still inhibited by an inhibitor of PKM&#x003b6; termed ZIP. The authors correctly state that the latter findings support either of two hypotheses: 1. PKM&#x003b6; is unnecessary for long term memory and late-phase LTP; or 2. PKM&#x003b6; is essential for these processes in wild-type mice, and compensatory mechanisms emerge in the PKM&#x003b6; mutant to substitute for PKM&#x003b6;. They systematically show that in the hippocampus, increased synthesis of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; compensates for the lack of PKM&#x003b6; in the mutant. PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;, like PKM&#x003b6;, is inhibited by ZIP, which explains the earlier results in the PKM&#x003b6; KO mutant.</p><p>The authors show that bath application of phosphorothioated antisense DNA oligonucleotides that are specific for the mRNA encoding PKM&#x003b6;, specifically block new synthesis of PKM&#x003b6; during late-phase LTP and also block formation of late-LTP in slices from wild type mice. Scrambled antisense oligonucleotides are the control. In contrast, the PKM&#x003b6; specific oligonucleotides do not block late phase LTP in slices from the PKM&#x003b6; KO mutant. This experiment demonstrates that a compensatory mechanism not involving PKM&#x003b6; has arisen in the mutant mice. I note that in cultured neurons, one would expect the experimenters to show rescue of late-LTP by exogenously expressed PKM&#x003b6; in conjunction with endogenous anti-sense knock-down. I do not think this particular control is necessary here because it would be very difficult to carry out cleanly in slices and animals; and later experiments by the authors make it clear that the compensatory process involves higher synthesis of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb;, which they show is not blocked by the anti-sense DNA against PKM&#x003b6;.</p><p>The authors then show that an inhibitor, termed ICAP, that is specific for inhibition of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; inhibits late-LTP in PKM&#x003b6; KO mutants, but does not inhibit late-LTP in wild type mice. They further show that new synthesis of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; increases after induction of LTP in PKM&#x003b6; KO mice, but does not increase in wild-type mice. These experiments, together with the catalytic similarity between PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; and PKM&#x003b6;, make a strong case that PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; compensates for the loss of PKM&#x003b6; in the KO mice, during late-LTP.</p><p>In a supplementary figure, the authors show the very interesting finding that an increased level of basal PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; is measurable in the hippocampus of PKM&#x003b6; KO mice, but not in the contralatera hemi-brain. Thus, the role of PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; may be more prominent in hippocampus than in cortex. This finding explains the earlier report that PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; is not increased in expression in KO brains.</p><p>The authors then show that PKM&#x003b6; antisense blocks retention of a spatial memory, shock-avoidance task in wild-type mice, but not in PKM&#x003b6; KO mice. Thus, the compensation extends to behavioral measures. They further show that the retention is blocked in PKM&#x003b6; KO mice by ICAP, but is not blocked by ICAP in wild-type mice. Finally, the authors show that certain forms of memory are not as efficient in the PKM&#x003b6; KO mice as in wild-type; thus, demonstrating that the compensation by PKC&#x003b9;/&#x003bb; is only partially effective.</p><p>My only critical comments are minor, involving clarity of the statistical measures, and are shown below.</p><p>To my knowledge, this is the most complete demonstration of a compensatory mechanism in synapses following KO of a critical component. In addition to proving that PKM&#x003b6; indeed plays a necessary role in maintenance of late phase LTP, the study provides interesting insight into the precision of such mechanisms underlying behavioral memory. The authors are to be congratulated.</p><p>The statistical analyses of the authors' experiments are extensive; but are only partially explained in the Methods section.

<italic>My main concern Over 20 years, Dr Sacktor has been building a story about identifying the likely molecular mechanism of long-term memory. The driving concept behind this is stated clearly in the first paragraph of the Introduction in which it is asserted that the hypothesis of a molecule implicated in maintenance has specific experimental predictions. I fear that the senior author's view on this is not shared by others as a third possibility is not considered &#x02013; namely that a molecule implicated in maintenance, while to be sure not contributing to initial memory formation, might not be sustained throughout the lifetime of a memory. To the contrary, it may trigger structural changes mediated by other molecules, and then depart the scene and no longer be involved. These structural changes would then be recycled during protein turnover in some way (but that is a separate albeit related problem in memory). An analogy might be helpful here. Consider a space rocket already in space that is circling the earth and is to be sent to the moon. For a brief period, the thrusters are activated and the rocket escapes earth's gravity and speeds up. It is on its way to the moon. The engines are stopped and the rocket keeps going. Should we look for the 'molecules' that sustain its motion towards the moon, akin to maintaining a memory as in Sacktor's argument? Or do we recognise that Newton's Laws of Motion distinguish acceleration and velocity and recognise that nothing is needed to sustain velocity in space? The molecules that make memory retention possible could, like the engines on a rocket, be activated only briefly.</italic> The relationship between the persistent increased activity of PKM&#x003b6; and the persistent changes in synaptic morphology proposed to sustain long-term memory for a lifetime is an important question for future research. The persistent action of PKM&#x003b6; could act to launch or to sustain for a period the structural changes such as new synaptic connections (Chen et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 3, e03896, 2014), which once established become independent of PKM&#x003b6;. Many of the remote long-term memories lasting a lifetime are thought to be stored in neocortex. Therefore, this hypothesis could be tested experimentally by examining when a long-term memory that can be erased by injections of ZIP in neocortex becomes resistant to PKM&#x003b6; inhibition. So far, PKM&#x003b6;-dependence has been tested for up to 3 months. In the published experiments on remote memory in neocortex, intracranial injections of ZIP disrupt 1-month-old fear memories in visual, auditory, and olfactory cortices (Sacco and Sacchetti, 329, 649-56, 2010), and 3-month-old conditioned taste aversion memories in insular cortex (Shema et al., 16, 122-8, 2009). Future studies should examine even older memories.</p><p>The discussion of this key question on memory is highlighted in <xref ref-type="box" rid="B1">Box 1</xref>.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>My only critical comments are minor, involving clarity of the statistical measures, and are shown below.</p><p><italic>The statistical analyses of the authors' experiments are extensive; but are only partially explained in the Methods section.
