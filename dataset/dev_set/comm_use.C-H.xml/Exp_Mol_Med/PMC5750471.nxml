In the brain, TREM2 is highly expressed on the cell surface of microglia, where it can transduce signals to regulate microglial functions such as phagocytosis. To date, mechanisms underlying intracellular trafficking of TREM2 remain elusive. Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) catalytic subunit of the &#x003b3;-secretase complex have been associated with increased generation of the amyloidogenic A&#x003b2; (amyloid-&#x003b2;) 42 peptide through cleavage of the A&#x003b2; precursor amyloid precursor protein. Here we found that TREM2 interacts with PS1 in a manner independent of &#x003b3;-secretase activity. Mutations in TREM2 alter its subcellular localization and affects its interaction with PS1. Upregulation of PS1 reduces, whereas downregulation of PS1 increases, steady-state levels of cell surface TREM2. Furthermore, PS1 overexpression results in attenuated phagocytic uptake of A&#x003b2; by microglia, which is reversed by TREM2 overexpression. Our data indicate a novel role for PS1 in regulating TREM2 intracellular trafficking and pathophysiological function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Recently, several heterozygous missense mutations in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been identified as risk factors for a number of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> For example, the <italic>TREM2 R47H</italic> variant has been reported to confer an increased risk of AD in comparable odds ratios to <italic>APOE4</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> the greatest known genetic risk factor for late-onset AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup></p><p>TREM2 is a type I transmembrane protein comprising an extracellular, Ig-like V-type domain; a transmembrane domain; and an intracellular domain lacking any obvious signaling motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).

Using this system, we identified positive interactions between TREM2 and PS1: with PS1 overexpression in HEK293-TREM2 cells, a Myc antibody immunoprecipitated full-length PS1, PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF, while no interaction between TREM2 and NCT was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Conversely, TREM2 was co-precipitated using antibodies against PS1-NTF (Ab14) or PS1-CTF (anti-PS1 loop) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Moreover, we found that endogenous TREM2 co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous PS1 in BV2 microglial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The catalytically inactive dominant negative PS1 mutant (D385A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> retained interaction with TREM2 comparable to wild-type (WT) PS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Additionally, inhibition of &#x003b3;-secretase activity with Compound E (CpdE) did not affect PS1/TREM2 co-precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). These results demonstrate that PS1 interacts with TREM2 and that the interaction occurs irrespective of &#x003b3;-secretase activity.</p><p>To map the domain(s) required for TREM2/PS1 interaction, we co-transfected PS1 and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged full-length or truncated TREM2 into HEK293 cells and assayed for interactions between PS1 and TREM2-GST constructs in Glutathione Sepharose precipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1f and g</xref>). We found that TREM2 constructs comprising the transmembrane region (175&#x02013;195 amino acids) co-precipitated with PS1, whereas TREM2 fragments lacking the transmembrane region pulled down much less PS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), suggesting that the TREM2 transmembrane domain is crucial for TREM2/PS1 interaction.</p><p>Given that several disease-associated mutations in TREM2 have been previously described to alter its intracellular localization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> we generated HEK293 cell lines stably overexpressing TREM2 R47H, T66M and T96K mutants. We found that WT, R47H and T96K TREM2 predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus, as seen by high colocalization coefficients observed with the Golgi marker TGN46, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and c</xref>), whereas T66M TREM2 primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as indicated by colocalization with the ER marker PDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b and c</xref>). In addition, we observed that T66M mutation markedly reduced cell surface TREM2 expression, whereas R47H and T96K mutations did not affect surface expression of TREM2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). PS1 could also be found in TGN46- or PDI-labeled structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a&#x02013;c</xref>). Partial TREM2/PS1 colocalization was observed with the various TREM2 variants: specifically, staining overlap (white color) was observed among WT, R47H or T96K TREM2, PS1 and TGN46, and overlapping staining of T66M TREM2, PS1 and PDI was also apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a&#x02013;c</xref>). Although mutations in TREM2 did not influence PS1/TREM2 colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), comparatively weaker T66M TREM2 interaction with PS1 was observed relative to the interaction between WT TREM2 and PS1, based on co-IP assays using the PS1 antibody Ab14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Moreover, we also observed colocalization between endogenous TREM2 and PS1 in the BV2 microglial cell line (Pearson&#x02019;s colocalization coefficient, 0.41&#x000b1;0.11), primarily in Golgi-like compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>PS1 has been reported to regulate cell surface delivery of several transmembrane proteins such as amyloid precursor protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> We next determined whether PS1 can affect surface expression of TREM2 by cell surface biotinylation assays. PS1 overexpression in HEK293-TREM2 cells resulted in a significant reduction in cell surface TREM2 levels with no change in total TREM2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Furthermore, we found that PS1 overexpression reduced cell surface TREM2 levels in the presence of the &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor CpdE, indicating that PS1-dependent depletion of TREM2 at the cell surface occurs independently of &#x003b3;-secretase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). To confirm these effects in a microglia-derived cell line, we generated a murine microglial BV2 cell line stably overexpressing PS1, transduced with a lentiviral delivery system (BV2-PS1). We observed a reduction in endogenous TREM2 at the cell surface in BV2-PS1 cells compared with control BV2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). To further clarify the regulatory effects of PS1 on TREM2 trafficking, we examined the effect of PS1 downregulation on cell surface TREM2 expression in BV2 cells. We found that PS1 knockdown significantly increased cell surface TREM2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). As expected, cell surface NCT levels were concomitantly reduced upon PS1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). We then investigated whether upregulation of other &#x003b3;-secretase components such as NCT may have similar effects, and we found that overexpression of NCT had little effect on cell surface TREM2 distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Together, these results indicate that TREM2 cell surface distribution is regulated by PS1 in a manner independent of the &#x003b3;-secretase complex.</p><p>The presence of TREM2 at the cell surface is important for transducing extracellular ligand signals to enact a microglial response. Several studies have reported that reduction of cell surface TREM2 expression in microglia cells can attenuate phagocytic function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> In support of this notion, transient overexpression of PS1 reduced phagocytic uptake of FAM-labeled A&#x003b2;42 within a 2-h incubation period in BV2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We further confirmed a reduction in FAM-A&#x003b2;42 uptake in BV2-PS1 cells by flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). To determine whether this reduction was TREM2-dependent, we transduced BV2-PS1 cells with lentiviruses expressing human TREM2. Strikingly, BV2-PS1 cells overexpressing TREM2 (BV2-PS1+TREM2) exhibited comparable phagocytic activity to control BV2 cells lacking PS1 and TREM2 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In addition, we found that cell surface expression of TREM2 in BV2-PS1+TREM2 cells is comparable to that in BV2-control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). We observed no significant difference between the control and PS1 knockdown samples in bulk microglial phagocytic uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Together, these results indicate that PS1 and TREM2 interact to reduce cell surface TREM2 distribution and downstream phagocytotic function.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>TREM2 has been previously reported to be a substrate of the &#x003b3;-secretase complex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> which suggests that TREM2 proteolysis could influence cell surface TREM2 distribution and function. Coordination of &#x003b3;-secretase subunits including PSs, APH-1, NCT and PEN-2 is a prerequisite for &#x003b3;-secretase-mediated proteolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> Since total full-length TREM2 levels were unaffected by PS1 overexpression, this suggests that PS1 upregulation alone cannot enhance TREM2 proteolysis. Although inhibition of &#x003b3;-secretase activity has recently been shown to reduce TREM2-mediated phagocytosis, which may be due to competitive binding between accumulated TREM2-CTF and DAP12, thereby impairing interactions between full-length TREM2 and DAP12 that are required for phagocytosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> our results demonstrate that PS1-dependent TREM2 trafficking remains unaffected by &#x003b3;-secretase inhibition. Therefore, the effects of PS1 overexpression on TREM2 trafficking and microglial phagocytosis are likely not due to &#x003b3;-secretase-dependent TREM2 cleavage in our system. Moreover, PS1 knockdown also had no effect on microglial phagocytosis. We speculate that cell surface full-length TREM2 and TREM2-CTF are both increased with PS1 knockdown, whereby both full-length TREM2 and TREM2-CTF can compete for DAP12 binding, thus producing no net effect on DAP12 signaling. On the whole, it is likely that PS1 can regulate the phagocytic function of TREM2 through both &#x003b3;-secretase-dependent proteolytic and &#x003b3;-secretase-independent trafficking roles.</p><p>Since TREM2 can be cleaved by (ADAM10A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10) on the cell surface,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> we speculate that overexpression of PS1 may reduce TREM2 ectodomain shedding. Although we do not know at this time how PS1 regulates TREM2 intracellular trafficking, several possibilities exist: one possibility is that PS1 affects the TREM2 trafficking from the Golgi/TGN; alternatively, PS1 may affect TREM2 internalization from the cell surface; a third possibility is that PS1 modulates the recycling of TREM2 from the endosomes and TGN to the cell surface. Future study may yield further information regarding how TREM2/PS1 interplay can affect consequent TREM2 distribution.</p><p>Various mutations identified in the TREM2 ectodomain exert differing effects on TREM2 structure. While R47H and T96K do not drastically affect TREM2 folding, T66M results in misfolding of TREM2 protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> Indeed, this may explain the altered subcellular localization of T66M TREM2 and reduced T66M/PS1 interaction that we observed. In addition to its role in mediating proteolytic catalysis within the &#x003b3;-secretase complex, PS1 has been shown to execute other functions including the regulation of calcium homeostasis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> and trafficking of various membrane proteins such as amyloid precursor protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Our results here point to a novel role for PS1 in regulating microglial phagocytosis through the regulation of TREM2 trafficking. Given that TREM2 signaling is also involved in the production of inflammatory cytokines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> it may be of interest to further determine whether PS1 has a &#x003b3;-secretase-independent role in mediating neuroinflammation. As neuroinflammatory processes such as microglial activation and cytokine generation are commonplace in multiple neurodegenerative diseases such as AD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> modulation of PS1/TREM2 trafficking may present alternative targeting strategies to treat AD. Since the use of &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitors to inhibit A&#x003b2; generation has largely failed clinically,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> alternative strategies such as targeting PS1/TREM2 trafficking may be more effective in reversing cognitive decline near the onset of AD.</p></sec><sec><title>Publisher&#x02019;s note</title><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R21 AG048519, R01 AG021173, R01 AG038710, R01 AG044420, R01 NS046673, RF AG056130 and R01 AG056114 to HX), the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Association (to HX and YWZ), The Tanz Family Funds (to HX), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91332114 and U1405222 to HX; 81273817 and 81473740 to QW; 81225008 and 91332112 to YWZ), the Characteristic Key Discipline Construction Fund of Chinese Internal Medicine of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, and the Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology (2015Y4008).
