Some structural units, such as the alveolar duct, appear to participate in tissue repair as well as the development of bronchioalveolar carcinoma. Here, we demonstrate an approach to conduct laser microdissection of the lung alveolar duct for single-cell PCR analysis. Our approach involved three steps. (1) The initial preparation used mechanical sectioning of the lung tissue with sufficient thickness to encompass the structure of interest. In the case of the alveolar duct, the precision-cut lung slices were 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;m thick; the slices were processed using near-physiologic conditions to preserve the state of viable cells. (2) The lung slices were examined by transmission light microscopy to target the alveolar duct. The air-filled lung was sufficiently accessible by light microscopy that counterstains or fluorescent labels were unnecessary to identify the alveolar duct. (3) The enzymatic and microfluidic isolation of single cells allowed for the harvest of as few as several thousand cells for PCR analysis. Microfluidics based arrays were used to measure the expression of selected marker genes in individual cells to characterize different cell populations. Preliminary work suggests the unique value of this approach to understand the intra- and intercellular interactions within the regenerating alveolar duct.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>single-cell analysis</kwd><kwd>laser microdissection</kwd><kwd>microfluidics</kwd><kwd>alveolar duct</kwd><kwd>murine lung gene expression</kwd><kwd>signaling network</kwd><kwd>regenerative medicine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="35"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5071"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Complex tissues such as the lung are composed of structural hierarchies such as alveoli, alveolar ducts, and lobules (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Recent evidence indicates that these structures reflect not only mechanical relationships, but also functional units that selectively participate in integrated processes such as tissue regeneration (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and the development of bronchioalveolar carcinoma (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Because bulk analyses of cells and gene expression &#x02013; ignoring these regenerative units &#x02013; have failed to illuminate the interactions between cells participating in these processes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), there is growing interest in the spatial sampling of the cells within regenerative units.</p><p>The initial attempts to refine the bulk analysis of cells within regenerating tissues used flow cytometry (FC) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). FC is a multi-dimensional high-throughput technology that can analyze and sort individual cells based on their phenotypic characteristics &#x02013; in most cases, sorting is based on cell surface molecule expression (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This approach has provided useful insights into the molecular expression of cell populations participating in lung regeneration (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>); nonetheless, the relatively large number of cells sorted by FC has potentially obscured the cell&#x02013;cell interactions within individual regenerative units.</p><p>To address these limitations, there is growing interest in isolating cells within individual regenerative units; in lung regeneration, the anatomic unit appears to be the alveolar duct. This goal has been aided by two developments. First, computer-controlled laser microdissection of tissue has facilitated the rapid isolation of small anatomic units within complex tissues. The ability to harvest anatomic units, such as the alveolar duct, under physiologic conditions has enabled detailed single-cell analysis. Second, microfluidic devices capable of capturing and handling single cells allowed for the analysis of the small number of cells comprising anatomic units such as the alveolar duct. Furthermore, these isolated cells can now be analyzed for gene expression at the level of individual cells. The result is an opportunity to define not only the signaling interactions between cells, but also the molecular interactions and signaling pathways within cells (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we demonstrate the use of laser microdissection to isolate cells in the murine lung alveolar duct and the microfluidic isolation and gene expression analysis of individual cells within this structural unit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male mice, 8&#x02013;10-week-old wild type C57BL/6 (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were anesthetized as previously described (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).

(3) The enzymatic and microfluidic isolation of single cells for PCR allowed for the harvest of as few as several thousand cells for analysis. The data suggest the unique value of this approach to understanding the intra- and intercellular interactions within the regenerating or neoplastic alveolar duct.</p><p>Harvesting viable cells from the alveolar duct requires that tissue slices of the appropriate thickness have to be obtained in near-physiologic conditions. Manually sliced tissues have been used for nearly 90&#x02009;years in various <italic>in vitro</italic> applications (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>); however, the manually prepared slices have had limited reproducibility and viability (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A mechanical tool to facilitate the cutting of tissue of precise thickness was introduced by the Krumdieck in 1980 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). With progressive refinement, tissue microtomes now vibrate with varying amplitudes and frequencies to produce slices with highly reproducible thickness &#x02013; thus, these sections are referred to as precision-cut tissue slices (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). With current vibrating microtomes, precision-cut tissue slices preserve the original organ architecture, the cellular heterogeneity, and extracellular matrix found <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Precision-cut tissue slices, for example, have enabled the development of <italic>ex vivo</italic> systems for systematic pharmaco-kinetic profiling of tumors contained in their native 3-dimensional micro-environment (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>A key feature of precision-cut lung slices in the lung is the use of agarose as structural support. Because live tissue is too soft for precise sectioning, and molten paraffin is too hot for live tissue, a biocompatible liquid with a low-temperature gelling point is used as an embedding medium. Agarose is typically used for lung embedding because it has sufficiently low viscosity at 37&#x02013;40&#x000b0;C to be infused into the distal airspaces, yet is sufficiently rigid for microtome sectioning at 4&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Although there is a significant overlap between techniques, laser microdissection can be distinguished from laser capture microdissection (LCM) by the method of cell isolation. In the original LCM system developed at the National Institutes of Health, the target cells were identified by light microscopy and captured using an infrared laser (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). A transfer film positioned over the region of interest (typically tumor cells) was melted into the tissue using an IR laser. The dissected tissue microsample was then lifted from the histopathology slide for subsequent RNA, DNA, or protein analysis. In most contemporary LCM systems, a requirement for effective capture is the dehydration of the tissue &#x02013; a requirement that precludes the study of live cells (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In contrast, our laser microdissection approach uses a cutting UV laser to define the margins of the dissection under near-physiologic conditions. Although UV-induced thermal injury to the neighboring cells is demonstrable using live-dead assays; the dissection margins can be drawn to minimize the injury to the region of interest. In our application, we maintained near-physiologic conditions during the UV laser dissection with only blotting of the tissue surface to minimize excess liquid media prior to UV dissection. The UV laser-defined alveolar duct was subsequently transferred to the collection chamber without the use of an IR laser or transfer film; in most cases, the sample dropped into the chamber occasionally assisted by the application of liquid media.</p><p>A frequently under-appreciated characteristic of the lung is the large amount of extracellular matrix in the organ (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In addition, some extracellular matrix components &#x02013; most notably, elastin &#x02013; are resistant to common enzymatic treatments (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In our application, we have used a variety of enzymatic cocktails based on collagenase to facilitate dissolution of the laser-dissected tissue; however, the most important component has proven to be collagenase Type IV. In our protocols, we used 35-&#x003bc;m mesh to separate cells from the collagenase-resistant matrix debris. Routine re-examination of the filtered debris did not show residual cells suggesting that this approach does not result in the systematic loss of any particular cell subpopulation. Of note, cell filtration with mesh larger than 35&#x02009;&#x003bc;m was prone to debris-induced occlusion of the microfluidics chip.</p><p>The cells isolated by microfluidics were studied using a custom 96 gene PCR panel. The results of prior FC population studies were used to select the genes used in this custom panel (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). FC-derived cell type-specific markers were incorporated into the panel to facilitate the spatial reconstruction of intercellular interactions within the alveolar duct. For example, the genes <italic>Acta2</italic> and <italic>Pecam1</italic> were added to the PCR panel to identify myofibroblasts and endothelial cells, respectively. Although the single-cell transcriptional data must be analyzed in the context of potential limitations, such as burst transcription (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), insights derived from these data should be useful for re-interpreting population-based data both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Single-cell analysis is particularly relevant to the process of carcinogenesis within the alveolar duct. Bronchioalveolar stem cells, in addition to contributing to the maintenance and repair of the normal alveolar duct, have been shown to give rise to lung adenocarcinomas (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The experimental challenge is that multipotent stem cells, like those giving rise to bronchioalveolar carcinoma, exist in low frequency within the peripheral lung. Population-based analyses are prone to overlook these cells and their transcriptional profile because of the &#x0201c;averaging&#x0201d; effect demonstrated in our study. Because of this limitation, we anticipate that single-cell analysis of the regenerating alveolar duct will provide important insights into the biology of bronchioalveolar stem cells.</p><p>Finally, these results demonstrate the ability to extract viable cells from a morphologically defined micro-region of a tissue sample. We successfully applied single-cell whole-transcriptome amplification and gene expression analyses to these samples &#x02013; a process that allows for simultaneous region-specific and cell type-specific expression analysis. We anticipate even more interesting experiments are possible in the future. For example, similarly obtained viable single cells can facilitate a variety of experimental perturbations prior to endpoint analyses (e.g., expression profiling, nucleic acid sequencing, immunoassays, or proteomics). Furthermore, new statistical and bioinformatics techniques may be used to design efficient strategies for sampling cells at different locations in the tissue and at different time-points, and to study the genomics and transcriptomics of these cellular samples, thus leading to construction of spatio-temporal cell signaling networks. We are confident that such studies involving single-cell analysis will lead to a more nuanced understanding of the process of tissue regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S6"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fonc.2014.00260/abstract">http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fonc.2014.00260/abstract</uri></p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><media xlink:href="Data_Sheet1.XLSX"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Supported in part by NIH Grants HL94567 and CA009535.
