These ligands binds glycosylphosphatidlyinositol (GPI)-anchored or soluble versions of the GDNF receptor &#x003b1; (GFR&#x003b1;) family that act as Ret co-receptors. Ret receptor dimers, together with two molecules of the ligand-bound co-receptors form a complex leading to kinase activation and stimulation of intracellular signalling pathways influencing proliferation, differentiation and migration (de Groot et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2006</xref>; Morandi et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2011</xref>).</p><p>Germ line gain-of-function <italic>RET</italic> mutations are associated with familial neuroendocrine tumours and medullary thyroid cancers; <italic>RET</italic> mutations are also found in sporadic medullary and papillary thyroid carcinoma (Ichihara et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2004</xref>; Morandi et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2011</xref>; Sariola and Saarma, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">2003</xref>). More recently, oncogenic <italic>RET</italic> fusions were identified in lung adenocarcinomas (Kohno et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2012</xref>; Suehara et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2012</xref>; Takeuchi et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2012</xref>). Considering breast cancer, <italic>RET</italic> copy number gains have been documented (Nikolsky et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2008</xref>) and <italic>RET</italic> mutations and rearrangements have been reported at low frequencies (Kan et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2010</xref>; Unger et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2010</xref>); however, these have not been examined for transforming ability.</p><p>We and others have reported that some breast tumours show abnormally high wild type Ret RNA and protein and that a sub-set of these tumours are estrogen receptor-&#x003b1; positive (ER+) (Boulay et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>; Plaza-Menacho et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2010</xref>). Here we show that elevated levels of the Ret receptor are found not only in ER+ tumours, but in other sub-types of human breast cancer and that high Ret levels correlate with decreased metastasis-free survival. An important goal of the studies presented here was to explore the role of Ret in ER+ breast cancer models, combining <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches. <italic>RET</italic> is an ER target gene (Boulay et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>; Frasor et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2004</xref>; Tozlu et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2006</xref>) and we have previously shown that Ret activation enhances estrogen-stimulated proliferation (Boulay et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>). We show here that proliferation of the ER+ MCF7 model is inhibited by endocrine agents and GDNF addition rescued the proliferative block. Moreover, Ret stimulation increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the presence of endocrine treatment. Indeed, we uncovered a positive-feed forward loop that links IL6 and Ret at the expression level and has functional implications. Both GDNF and IL6 stimulate migration of breast cancer cell lines and <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibition of Ret significantly decreases tumour outgrowth and the metastatic potential of an ER+ model. Our results suggest that Ret receptor has an important role in tumour growth and metastasis and should be considered as a novel therapeutic target in subsets of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Elevated Ret levels correlate with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients</title><p>Ret receptor levels have been shown to be elevated in breast tumours (Boulay et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>; Esseghir et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2007</xref>; Plaza-Menacho et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2010</xref>). In order to assess whether Ret expression correlates with clinical parameters, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Ret was carried out on tumour tissue arrays (TMA) from female breast cancer patients who underwent surgery at the Medical University of Vienna between 1988 and 1994. Examples of negative, moderate and strong Ret staining are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1</xref>A. Controls for Ret antibody specificity are shown in Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>A. Correlations of the Ret-score with clinical and histopathological parameters and with different molecular subtypes are shown in Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1 and S2</xref>. High Ret levels (score &#x0003e;60), which were detected in 66 of the 89 cases, significantly correlate with large tumour size (&#x0003e;2 cm; pT2-pT4) and high tumour stage. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that high Ret levels were significantly associated with decreased metastasis-free survival and overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1</xref>B, C).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Ret analysis in breast cancer</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><bold>A.</bold> Representative images of negative, moderate and strong Ret immunohistochemical staining in a tissue microarray of human breast cancer are shown.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>B,C.</bold> Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analyses of the metastasis&#x02013;free survival and overall survival.

The latter was established from an MMTV-Amplified in Breast Cancer 1 (AIB1) transgenic mouse mammary tumour (Torres-Arzayus et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2006</xref>; Torres-Arzayus et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2010</xref>); AIB1 is an ER co-activator (Li et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">1997</xref>). All four cell lines are Ret+ (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>A) and form tumours in mice; however, only J110-induced tumours (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>B), are metastatic (Torres-Arzayus et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2010</xref>). Thus, with these models we can study Ret's role in proliferation, migration and metastasis.</p><p>Ret activation stimulates migration of different cancer types (Ito et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2005</xref>; Morandi et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2011</xref>). We examined the breast cancer cell lines for Ret-mediated motility in response to GDNF, which activates Ret, as shown by an increase in its phospho-tyrosine content (pY) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2</xref>A and (Boulay et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>)]. Transwell assays carried out with MCF7 and J110 cells showed that GDNF treatment significantly stimulated migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2</xref>B). T47D cells were tested in a wound-healing assay following the addition of GDNF plus GFR&#x003b1;1 (GDNF/GFR&#x003b1;1), since these cells do not express the Ret co-receptor (Boulay et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>). Ligand treatment significantly stimulated migration into the wounded area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2</xref>C). We also tested T47D cells with lower Ret levels, using two specific siRNAs (siRNA Ret1 and Ret2) (Boulay et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>), both of which strongly reduce Ret and the cellular response to GDNF/GFR&#x003b1;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2</xref>D). The two Ret knock-down (KD) cell lines fail to migrate in response to ligand treatment, while the GDNF/GFR&#x003b1;1-treated siLacZ control cells were significantly better in filling the wound, in comparison to non-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2</xref>E). In summary, Ret activation stimulates migration of these breast cancer models.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>GDNF induces cell migration and proliferation of breast cancer cells</title><p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>MCF7, MCF7/Aro and J110 tumour cells were stimulated with GDNF (10 ng/ml) for 15 min, lysates were prepared and pY and total Ret levels were analysed by western blots (WB) or by Ret immonoprecipitations (IP) followed by WB.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Chemotactic response of MCF7 and J110 cells to GDNF was measured in transwell assays.

Considering this ER-Ret interaction, we asked if Ret activation would impact on the anti-proliferative effects of endocrine agents that work by different mechanisms. For these experiments we used the MCF7/Aro cells in order to analyse effects of the aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole, as well as fulvestrant that promotes ER degradation and the ER antagonist tamoxifen (Forbes et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2008</xref>). Both GDNF and &#x00394;4A significantly increased proliferation of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2</xref>F). Treatment with letrozole, fulvestrant or tamoxifen reversed the proliferative effects of &#x00394;4A and simultaneous treatment with GDNF significantly rescued MCF7/Aro cells from their anti-proliferative effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2</xref>F), demonstrating that Ret activation interferes with endocrine agent action.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome analysis of MCF7/Aro cells</title><p>To gain insight into the pathways that are affected by Ret activation in the absence or presence of letrozole and fulvestrant, gene expression profiling analyses were carried out using RNA from MCF7/Aro cells cultured in the conditions used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2</xref>F.

IL6 is known to be negatively regulated by estrogens (Kurebayashi et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">1997</xref>); accordingly, &#x00394;4A-treated cells produce very low amounts of IL6 and GDNF and fulvestrant increased IL6, although non-significantly.

Thus, we were surprised to see that in response to long-term &#x00394;4A + fulvestrant or E2 + fulvestrant there were higher Ret protein levels in MCF7/Aro and J110 cells, respectively, in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3</xref>B). Since fulvestrant stimulates IL6 expression, we tested the level of Ret in &#x00394;4A + fulvestrant exposed cultures treated simultaneously with an IL6- blocking &#x02013; or a control- antibody to see if IL6 might contribute to increased Ret. Indeed, the addition of the IL6 blocking antibody, but not the control IgG, caused a decrease in Ret, back to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3</xref>C). MCF7 cells treated directly with IL6 also show higher levels of Ret RNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3</xref>D). Taken together, the results suggest that there is a feed-forward Ret-IL6 loop at the expression level: Ret stimulation increases IL6 levels and IL6 stimulates Ret expression. Next we examined if IL6 and Ret are functionally linked at the migration level.</p><p>As GDNF, IL6 treatment significantly increased migration of MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4</xref>A), J110 cells (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>E) and T47D cells, as previously shown (Badache and Hynes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2001</xref>). We used two Ret selective kinase inhibitors, NVP-BBT594 (Boulay et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>) and NVP-AST487 (Akeno-Stuart et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2007</xref>) that block GDNF-induced Ret activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4</xref>B and Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>A) to examine motility in response to IL6 and GDNF. The Ret inhibitors reduced GDNF-induced migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4</xref>A and Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>B), but not EGF-induced migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4</xref>C). Interestingly, the Ret inhibitors also blocked IL6-stimulated migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4</xref>A and Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>B). Moreover, the effect of combined IL6 + GDNF on migration was the same as individual treatments and, in response to NVP-BBT594, returned to basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4</xref>A). These results suggest that IL6 requires Ret for stimulating motility, a conclusion that is strengthened by showing that Ret KD MCF7 cells [shRet1, characterized in (Boulay et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>)] are unable to migrate in response to IL6; while control LacZ1 cell do migrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4</xref>D). In the final experiment, we asked if the IL6 that we have shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3</xref>A) is present in the CM of fulvestrant + GDNF treated cells, stimulates migration. To test this, we used the IL6 blocking antibody that inhibits IL6-induced migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4</xref>E) and found that the migration of fulvestrant + GDNF treated cells is also significantly blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4</xref>E).

Once tumours averaged 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomized to receive daily treatment with vehicle control, or the inhibitor, for 12 days. In the NVP-AST487 treated mice there was a significant reduction in outgrowth kinetics, resulting in reduced tumour weight at the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5</xref>B). Taken together, these results show that Ret activity contributes significantly to tumour outgrowth potential in both the T47D and J110 breast cancer models, strengthening our hypothesis that Ret kinase could be a novel target in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of Ret inhibition alone or combined with endocrine agents on J110 tumour growth and metastases</title><p>Next, we tested the sensitivity of J110 tumours to the endocrine agents fulvestrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5</xref>C) and tamoxifen (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>), alone or combined with the Ret inhibitor. NVP-AST487 treatment blocked Ret activity, as shown by the decreased pY1062 Ret levels in comparison to control tumour lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5</xref>D, upper panel) and had a significant inhibitory effect on tumour outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5</xref>C, red line). Similar to the Ret inhibitor, fulvestrant also significantly blocked J110 outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5</xref>C, blue line); as expected IHC on tumour sections revealed lower ER&#x003b1; levels in the fulvestrant treated group, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5</xref>D, lower panel). J110 tumours, which are known to be relatively tamoxifen insensitive (Torres-Arzayus et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2006</xref>), initially responded to treatment; however, after 3 weeks tamoxifen-treated and control tumours were not significantly different in size (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>A, B).</p><p>For the combination studies, after 10 days of fulvestrant or tamoxifen treatment alone, the mice were divided into two groups, one that continued on endocrine agents only and one that received fulvestrant, or tamoxifen, plus NVP-AST487 for the remaining treatment time (arrow combo- in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5</xref> and Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>C). This schedule was chosen since we hypothesized that endocrine therapy might expose a role for Ret, thereby increasing sensitivity to Ret inhibition. This proved not to be the case, since the addition of NVP-AST487 to fulvestrant or to tamoxifen did not result in any additional effects on tumour outgrowth kinetics, or size, at the end of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5</xref>C and Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>B, C, respectively). Finally, lung metastases were examined. For each of the inhibitor-treated groups, the number of metastatic foci in the lungs was counted and the data were normalized and expressed as the metastatic index, <italic>i.e</italic>. number of foci/tumour weight. Inhibition of Ret alone or with fulvestrant significantly blocked metastatic spread, whereas fulvestrant treatment alone did not significantly decrease the metastatic index, although there was a trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5</xref>E). Tamoxifen had no effect on tumour dissemination; the metastatic index was the same as the vehicle control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5</xref>F). Strikingly, the addition of the Ret inhibitor to tamoxifen caused a strong reduction in the metastatic index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5</xref>F). Thus, Ret inhibition significantly blocks tumour growth of the T47D and J110 models. Moreover, inhibition Ret significantly lowers metastatic potential of J110 tumours, when alone or combined with endocrine agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Signalling analysis on J110-tumours</title><p>Our next experiments were aimed at uncovering pathways that contribute to Ret's anti-tumour and anti-metastatic activity.

We examined Ret IPs from J110 cell lysates and detected a constitutive Ret-Fak complex, which was present in lysates from control and GDNF-treated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig 6</xref>C). Next, Fak activation in response to GDNF and IL6 was examined. Both ligands induced an increase in pY576/577 Fak levels in MCF7 and J110 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig 7</xref>A). Treatment with NVP-AST487 blocked not only GDNF's ability to stimulate Fak, but also the effect of IL6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig 7</xref>A, left panel). Stat3 was also examined and pY705Stat3 levels were found to increase in response to IL6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig 7</xref>B, C), but not to GDNF (unpublished observation).

Unexpectedly, IL6-induced Stat3 activation was also blocked by both Fak inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig 7</xref>B&#x02013;C). Thus, IL6 depends on Fak as well as Ret to activate Stat3, results that could underpin IL6's requirement for Ret to stimulate migration.</p><p>In summary, our results show that IL6 and Ret are linked at the expression level and the functional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig 8</xref>A). In the tumour setting, we hypothesize that IL6 contributes to increased Ret expression, and Ret in turn helps maintain IL6 expression, thereby forming a positive feed-forward loop. To test this hypothesis we measured IL6 and Ret levels in J110 tumours. In cultured J110 cells, treatment with tamoxifen and fulvestrant significantly stimulates IL6 RNA expression (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>D). However, in endocrine treated J110 tumours, there was no consistent increase in IL6 RNA, although there was a trend in the fulvestrant group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig 8</xref>B). The most striking effects were seen on Ret RNA levels, which were lower in tumours treated with NVP-AST487 alone or combined with the endocrine agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>B).

In breast cancer, the ErbB2 specific antibody trastuzumab is now routinely given in combination with chemotherapy to ErbB2/HER2-positive breast cancer patients and has had a significant impact on patient mortality (Gianni et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2011</xref>). However, only a sub-set of patients are eligible for this treatment, making it essential to uncover additional RTKs that could be useful in breast cancer therapy; Ret might be one such RTK.</p><p>Ret was discovered as an outlier kinase in breast cancer, with unexpectedly high expression levels detected in many breast tumours (Boulay et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>; Esseghir et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2007</xref>; Kothari et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2013</xref>; Plaza-Menacho et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2010</xref>). Unlike thyroid or lung tumours that carry oncogenic Ret, as fusion proteins or with activating mutations, Ret appears to be wild type in breast cancer. We show here that Ret levels significantly correlate with large tumour size and high tumour stage. Importantly the Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that high Ret levels were significantly associated with decreased metastasis-free and overall survival. Considering the <italic>in vivo</italic> models, we show that Ret inhibition significantly decreases T47D and J110 primary tumour outgrowth and the metastatic potential of J110 tumours. Our results suggest that Ret receptor has an important role in tumour growth and metastasis.</p><p>The mechanisms that contribute to elevated Ret levels in breast cancer are not known. <italic>RET</italic> copy number gains have been described (Nikolsky et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2008</xref>) and might play a role. Moreover, <italic>RET</italic> is an ER target gene (Boulay et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>; Frasor et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2004</xref>; Tozlu et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2006</xref>) and an analysis of &#x0003e;200 breast tumours showed a significant association between Ret RNA levels and ER positivity (Esseghir et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2007</xref>). We present here <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence of Ret's ER regulation, since Ret levels are decreased in tamoxifen-treated J110 tumours. However, the control of Ret expression appears complex since fulvestrant treatment did not result in a decrease. Indeed, we discovered that Ret was actually increased in tumour cells cultured in fulvestrant. Co-treatment of these cells with an IL6 blocking antibody decreased Ret levels, showing that the IL6 produced in response to fulvestrant was responsible for the effect. Thus, we have uncovered a novel mechanism whereby IL6 controls Ret expression. We can only speculate on the mechanism, but find it interesting to consider a role for Fak. As shown here, and elsewhere (Plaza-Menacho et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2011</xref>), Ret forms complexes with Fak and in some cancer models it has been shown that in Fak's absence Ret is degraded (Sandilands et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2012</xref>). In summary, Ret expression is subjected to multiple inputs affecting its RNA and protein levels. Factors like steroid hormones and cytokines, which are present in the tumour environment, are likely to contribute to Ret expression, which might help explain why our TMA analysis showed that elevated Ret levels were found in different molecular sub-types of breast tumours (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>B, C).</p><p>Considering Ret and its migratory function in developmental processes (Schuchardt et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">1994</xref>) and in cancer (Ito et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2005</xref>; Morandi et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2011</xref>), a major goal of our work was to study the role of Ret in a metastatic breast cancer model. We chose J110 cells since they are Ret+/ER+ and the primary mammary tumours resulting from their injection into fat pads spontaneously metastasize to lungs and other organs (Torres-Arzayus et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2010</xref>). Clinical (Morandi et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2013</xref>) as well as experimental evidence (Jan et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2012</xref>; Kang et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>; Plaza-Menacho et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2010</xref>) suggest that Ret activation could have a negative impact on endocrine therapy response. Our own experiments showing that GDNF treatment rescued MCF7/Aro cells from three different endocrine agents also point in this direction. This led us to hypothesize that in the J110 model, the combination of a Ret inhibitor with an endocrine agent might have better anti-tumour activity compared to the individual treatments. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we show that J110 tumours are sensitive to fulvestrant, but not to tamoxifen treatment. However, we did not see any further effect on tumour outgrowth when combining the Ret inhibitor with the endocrine treatments. Although disappointing, these experiments revealed the strong effect that Ret inhibition has on metastatic dissemination, which was particularly striking in the tamoxifen + NVP-AST487-treated tumours. Tamoxifen alone had no effect on tumour dissemination, but adding the Ret inhibitor caused a strong reduction in the metastatic index. Thus, for J110 tumour gowth, tamoxifen-insensitivity is dominant even in the presence of a Ret inhibitor; but Ret activity is absolutely required for J110 tumour cell dissemination to the lungs.</p><p>Our discovery of a positive feed-forward loop between the inflammatory cytokine IL6 and Ret that links them at the expression, as well as the functional level is novel. Functionally, we show that migration is a biological read-out of the Ret-IL6 interaction. The major intracellular mediator of migration and metastasis appears to be Fak, which links the IL6 and Ret pathways and is essential for their migratory effects. While we did not find a direct interaction of Ret and the IL6 co-receptor gp130 in our analyses, it is possible that Ret-complexed Fak is primed to respond to gp130 activation. Indeed, the initial step in Fak activation is release of the intra-molecular interaction between the FERM domain and the kinase domain (Frame et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2010</xref>). Considering that Ret binds directly to the FERM domain (Plaza-Menacho et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2011</xref>), its binding might release the negative interaction. Since we show that Jak kinase is also required for migration downstream of both receptors, a transient complex of the IL6 and Ret receptors and their associated kinases might form in response to ligand treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig 8</xref>C Model). Importantly, we show that <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibition of Ret, either by lowering its expression level or activity, significantly blocked tumour outgrowth potential of both ER+ models. In J110 tumours, Ret inhibition lowered Ret RNA and protein expression as well as pFak and pStat3 levels and this was associated with a strong decrease in metastatic spread. The pathway that we have uncovered might be generally relevant for Ret expressing breast tumours and could influence growth as well as migration and tumour cell dissemination.</p><p>Taken together, our studies are important since they suggest that blocking Ret kinase not only decreases tumour growth, but also impacts on the metastatic potential of the tumour cells. In our analyses we concentrated on Ret+/ER+ models, showing that blocking Ret has significant anti-tumour activity. In the future, it will be interesting to test the impact of blocking Ret in other sub-types of breast cancer, particularly in ErbB2/HER2 positive and basal-like models. In summary, the results we present suggest that the Ret kinase might be an attractive and novel therapeutic target in selected groups of breast cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Tumour tissue microarray (TMA)</title><p>Two TMAs from 108 female breast cancer patients who underwent surgery at the Medical University of Vienna in 1988&#x02013;1994 were analysed retrospectively under protocols approved by the institutional review board of the Medical University of Vienna (Vinatzer et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2005</xref>; Waerner et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2006</xref>).

Approximately 200 tumour cells per core biopsy were evaluated, and the fraction of Ret-positive tumour cells as well as the staining intensity (0, negative; 1, weak or moderate; 2, strong) were assessed. A Ret-score was calculated by multiplying the number of stained tumour cells (in %) with the staining intensity. A Ret-score below 60 was considered as low Ret, above 60 as high Ret.

The standard treatment for breast cancer patients whose tumours are estrogen receptor positive (ER+) is surgery followed by endocrine treatment. Most patients respond to endocrine therapy, however, many of them become resistant and relapse with metastatic disease in lungs, bones and other sites. Thus, further work using ER+ metastatic breast cancer models is warranted in order to uncover factors that might influence the course of disease.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>In this study we show that elevated levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret are detected in a significant percentage of human breast tumours stained with a Ret specific antibody. The high Ret group had a decreased 15-year metastasis-free survival compared to the low Ret group. We show that Ret activation in cultured cells rescues ER+ breast cancer cells from the anti-proliferative effects of endocrine therapy. Transcriptome analyses revealed that endocrine agents increased expression of IL6 and other inflammatory cytokines and we show that IL6 and Ret form a positive feed-forward loop that promotes migration. The <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of Ret inhibition were examined using two breast tumour models. Decreasing Ret levels or blocking its activity significantly lowered tumour outgrowth. Moreover, treatment of tumour-bearing mice with a Ret kinase inhibitor significantly blocked tumour dissemination and lowered the number of lung metastases. Ret inhibition also decreased Ret expression levels and lowered the activity of the Fak signalling pathway, all of which could contribute to blocking metastatic spread.</p><p>IMPACT:</p><p>This study shows that Ret levels are elevated in primary human breast tumours of different molecular subtypes and that high Ret expression is associated with decreased metastasis-free and overall survival. We uncovered a novel Ret-IL6 feed-forward loop in ER+ breast cancer models, which might be clinically relevant since, as we document here, the endocrine agent fulvestrant causes elevated expression of IL6 and other inflammatory cytokines. We show that the IL6-Ret feed-forward loop is blocked when Ret is inhibited and, in a metastatic breast cancer model, this correlates with decreased dissemination from the primary site. Thus, the results we present suggest that the Ret kinase might be an attractive and novel alternative therapeutic target in selected groups of breast cancer patients.</p></sec></boxed-text><p>For wound healing assays, confluent serum-deprived T47D cultures were scratched with a pipette tip and stimulated with GDNF/GFR&#x003b1;1 (10/100 ng/ml).
