There is no evidence of the sun protection factor (SPF) studies on essential oil of Calendula flowers (<italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> L., Asteraceae). The study investigates the <italic>in vitro</italic> SPF by ultraviolet specrtophotometry method of Calendula flower oil in a cream formulation. Calendula oil was isolated by Clavenger's apparatus, compositions were identified by GC&#x02013;MS and the cream of calendula flower oil was prepared by homogenization method followed by evaluation for physical parameters. The sun protection factor of cream was evaluated by <italic>in vitro</italic> method employing UV&#x02013;visible spectrophotometer (Shimazdu-1600). The SPF of Calendula oil in cream formulation exhibited good activity (SPF = 14.84 &#x000b1; 0.16). Finding of this study suggested that calendula oil cream can be used to protect the skin from UV radiations in form of sunscreen cream and to maintain the natural pigmentation of the skin.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Calendula officinalis</italic></kwd><kwd>calendula oil</kwd><kwd>essential oil</kwd><kwd>sun protection factor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Applying a sunscreen to skin changes the way the body reacts to the sun's rays.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Sunscreens are like medicine we apply to our skin to keep it healthy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The proof of sunscreen products efficacy is of great significance for the protection of public health as the UVB rays of solar radiation is the main contributor to skin sunburn, immunosuppression, and skin cancer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Standard test methods for SPF evaluation may offer consumers worldwide consistent values efficacy of sunscreen products.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] According to the USFDA and COLIPA guidelines, the SPF of a sunscreen product is calculated as the ratio of the minimal erythema dose (MED) of sunscreen-protected skin to the MED of unprotected skin and performed on <italic>in vivo</italic> on human volunteers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In general, the test sunscreen sample is applied at a thickness of 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> when evaluating the SPF.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p><italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> L.

No evidence was found from the literature survey on the sun protection factor studies on <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> flower essential oil but it was reported that tribal persons uses the calendula extract and oil to cure various dermatological ailments as skin injuries and in some cases of burns.
