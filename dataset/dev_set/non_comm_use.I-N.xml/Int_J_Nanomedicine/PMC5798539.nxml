Innovative, environmentally benign and economic nanotechnology-based approaches have recently emerged utilizing principally biological sources to produce nano-sized structures with unique antimicrobial properties.

Fungi may spread to the scalp or nails causing hair loss and thickened or deformed fingernails. The etiological agents behind dermatomycosis are mostly filamentous dermatophytes (eg, <italic>Microsporum</italic> spp., <italic>Trichophyton</italic> spp. or <italic>Epidermophyton</italic> spp.), however, several opportunistic yeast species such as <italic>Candida</italic> or <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> can invade keratinized tissues.<xref rid="b1-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In case of cutaneous candidiasis, the origin is mostly endogenous as the causative agents (ie, <italic>Candida</italic> spp.) are the resident or transient members of the human dermal microflora. <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> can induce meningitis in immunocompromised patients, however, due to systemic dissemination of yeast cells in such patients, skin lesions may also appear.<xref rid="b4-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In addition to this secondary variant, a primary form of cutaneous cryptococcosis has recently been identified, where the pathogen enters the body directly through skin injury.<xref rid="b5-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Regardless of the distinct origins of <italic>Cr. neoformans</italic> infections, this pathogen can cause life-threatening systemic complications in the host.<xref rid="b4-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, there is an inevitable and urgent medical need to find novel and efficient agents to defeat opportunistic pathogens and cutaneous mycosis-causing species. To achieve this goal, an innovative, environmentally benign and economic approach is required.</p><p>A solution that fulfills these demands could be based on nanotechnology, since owing to the abundance of recent scientific advancements in this field, it is now possible to design and develop nano-sized structures with unique properties tailored for specific applications (eg, in optics, in electronics, in catalysis, and in household items, as well as in medicine).<xref rid="b6-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In recent years, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs),<xref rid="b7-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> in particular, have been in the focus of increasing interest due to their simple synthesis and desirable biological activities (ie, antitumor, antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal effects).<xref rid="b8-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> We have reported that the cytotoxic features of AgNPs can be exploited to kill p53 tumor suppressor-deficient<xref rid="b10-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> as well as multidrug-resistant cancer cells,<xref rid="b11-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> providing some further details to the mechanism of AgNP-induced antitumor actions. In recent years, several studies have also demonstrated that AgNPs, synthesized either by conventional chemical reduction methods, physical techniques or by different biological entities, exhibit potent inhibitory effects against Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial species and induce cytotoxicity in various pathogenic fungi.<xref rid="b8-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Green alternatives to harsh reducing chemicals and environmentally benign capping agents have also been developed to reduce the costs of nanoparticle production and to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes upon the synthetic procedures.<xref rid="b13-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In a comprehensive study on AgNPs obtained by chemical reduction using coffee and green tea extracts, we proved the remarkable antimicrobial efficiency of such particles,<xref rid="b14-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and we showed evidence that the green material used for AgNP synthesis can largely define the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the produced nanomaterial.<xref rid="b14-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Owing to widespread applications, there is an ever-growing demand for AgNPs and AuNPs, while the challenges of their economical, environmentally safe and sustainable production should also be addressed. A rapidly progressing area of nanobiotechnology is the microbe-assisted nanoparticle synthesis,<xref rid="b15-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> where bacterial strains, yeast- and alga-mediated reactions are exploited for nanoparticle generation.<xref rid="b16-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> One such study demonstrated that the astaxanthin-containing green alga <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> is a useful agent for gold nanoparticle synthesis.<xref rid="b18-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Based on this observation we hypothesized that <italic>Phaffia rhodozyma</italic> (perfect state <italic>Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous</italic>), a basidiomycetous red yeast with high astaxanthin content,<xref rid="b19-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> might also be a potential candidate for microbe-assisted nanoparticle synthesis. Therefore, the aim of this present study was to investigate the suitability of <italic>P. rhodozyma</italic> cell-free extract for the preparation of AgNPs and AuNPs. Since our synthesis method proved to be successful, the as-prepared nanoparticles were characterized, and a complex biological screening was carried out to determine their biological activity, where beside toxicity to human skin-derived cells, the antifungal efficiency of the biosynthesized nanoparticles was also assessed with a special emphasis on inhibitory features against opportunistic pathogenic yeasts and dermatophytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of <italic>P. rhodozyma</italic> cell-free extract</title><p><italic>P. rhodozyma</italic> American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 24203 cells grown on 2&#x000d7; yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA) (2% D-glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract and 2% agar) plates at 22&#x000b0;C for 5 days were collected by cell scraper. Ten grams of wet weight biomass were suspended in 200 mL sterile distilled water and the cells were disrupted in Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA) using glass beads with 0.5&#x02013;1 mm diameter. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min in Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was filtered through 0.45 &#x000b5;m pore sized nitrocellulose membrane (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The filtrate was used as a reducing agent and stabilizer for the synthesis of nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec><title>Synthesis of AgNPs and AuNPs</title><p>After optimization of the nanoparticle synthesis process, the following protocol was used. For preparation of AgNP, 90 mL cell-free extract (pH 6.7) was mixed with 10 mL of 1 M AgNO<sub>3</sub> suspension. Gold nanoparticles were synthesized similarly, by adding 10 mL 1 M HAuCl<sub>4</sub> solution to 90 mL cell-free extract. Both suspensions were constantly stirred using an orbital shaker at 22&#x000b0;C for 24 hours. Nanoparticles were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 18,000 <italic>g</italic> in Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge at 4&#x000b0;C then washed twice with sterile distilled water. The final colloid suspensions were characterized and stored at 4&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of nanoparticles</title><p>The morphological features of the synthesized AgNPs and AuNPs were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a FEI Tecnai G<sup>2</sup> 20 microscope (FEI Corporate Headquarters, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The hydrodynamic particle size distribution of the samples was assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The crystal structures were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), where the scans were performed with a Rigaku MiniFlex II powder diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) using Cu K&#x003b1; radiation.

HaCaT cells were seeded into 96 well plates (10,000/wells) and treated with either AgNPs or AuNPs, or with cisplatin in different concentrations on the following day. After 24-hour treatments cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with culture medium containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT reagent for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C. Formazan crystals were solubilized in DMSO and extinction was measured at 570 nm using a Synergy HTX plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Absorption corresponding to the untreated control samples was considered as 100%. MTT assays were performed at least three times using four independent biological replicates.</p><p>Cytotoxicity of the synthesized nanoparticles was assessed by crystal violet staining as well. For this, HaCaT cells were seeded into 24 well plates and were left to grow until they reached confluence. Then cell layers were treated with nanoparticles or with cisplatin for 24 hours. After each treatment, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed using methanol:acetone 70:30 mixture. Fixed cells were then stained using 0.5% crystal violet dissolved in 25% methanol, washed with distilled water then air-dried. Plates were photographed, and crystal violet was solubilized using 400 &#x000b5;L 10% acetic acid.

DLS measurements were also carried out to determine hydrodynamic particle sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-13-695">Figure 1B</xref>). The average size of AgNPs was between 5 and 9 nm diameter, whereas the size of gold nanoparticles was around 4&#x02013;7 nm. The formation of metal nanoparticles was ascertained by UV-VIS measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-13-695">Figure 1C</xref>). The typical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of AgNPs appeared around 455 nm. UV-VIS spectra of AuNPs showed absorption peak maxima at 541 nm characteristic to SPR, which further supported the formation of metallic gold nanoparticles. In order to confirm the crystalline nature of the nanoparticles, XRD analysis was performed.

Interestingly, <italic>Cr. neoformans</italic> was sensitive to AuNPs as well, whereas other species exhibited resistance against AuNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-13-695">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Since <italic>Cr. neoformans</italic> appeared susceptible to both nanoparticles, the antifungal effect of AgNPs and AuNPs was assessed more quantitatively on this particular strain. Hence, <italic>Cr. neoformans</italic> cells were subjected to different concentrations of AgNPs and AuNPs for 24 hours then cell viability was determined using colony forming assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-13-695">Figure 3B</xref>). Treatments with 1 &#x000b5;g/mL of either AgNPs or AuNPs already resulted in a significant loss of cell viability, whereas the number of viable <italic>Cr. neoformans</italic> cells dropped below the detectable level following 30 &#x000b5;g/mL of AuNP or AgNP administrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-13-695">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>To further test the viability of nanoparticle-treated <italic>Cr. neoformans</italic> cells, calcein-AM staining procedure was applied. As expected, increasing concentrations of either AgNPs or AuNPs gradually diminished the percentage of calcein-positive cells. After 10 &#x000b5;g/mL AgNP administration, approximately 50% of the cells were alive, while 83% of the examined cells were dead when AgNP concentration was elevated to 30 &#x000b5;g/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-13-695">Figure 3C</xref>). A similar pattern was observed when yeast cells were exposed to AuNPs, since nanoparticle treatments in 30 &#x000b5;g/mL concentrations decreased the percentage of the viable cells to approximately 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-13-695">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Time dependence of the nanoparticle-induced antifungal effect was also determined. For this purpose, <italic>Cr. neoformans</italic> cells were again subjected to 10 &#x000b5;g/mL AgNPs or AuNPs and after 1-, 3-, 10- and 24-hour treatments the number of the colonies was counted. Exposure to AgNPs for 1 hour caused a 50% decrease in the number of the CFU, but 10-hour treatments with either AgNPs or AuNPs reduced the number of viable cells below 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-13-695">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Anti-dermatophyte activity</title><p>All the three examined dermatophyte species were sensitive to AgNP treatments in growth inhibition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-13-695">Figure 4</xref>). AgNPs in 30 &#x000b5;g/mL concentration induced significant inhibition of colony growth, as the diameters of the colonies were markedly smaller, indicating an approximately 80% growth inhibition for each strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-13-695">Figure 4</xref>). On the other hand, none of the dermatophyte species reacted to AuNPs, when applied in 10 or 30 &#x000b5;g/mL concentrations. Therefore, AuNP concentration was elevated up to 300 &#x000b5;g/mL but still no inhibition was detected (data not shown), indicating that AuNPs are not suitable for the growth inhibition of the examined cutaneous mycosis-causing dermatophyte fungi.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Emerging problems associated with antibiotic-resistant microbes demanded new strategies to find novel antimicrobial agents.<xref rid="b23-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Due to their broad spectrum activity, silver-containing materials have been used as antiseptics and disinfectants for decades,<xref rid="b25-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> however the potential application of colloidal gold for medical purposes has only recently been recognized.<xref rid="b26-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Physical and chemical methods are generally considered as standard approaches for nanoparticle preparation, nevertheless these procedures lead to the accumulation of environmentally hazardous wastes.<xref rid="b27-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Furthermore, the presence of chemical residues within the nanoparticle colloid solutions limits their biomedical utilization.<xref rid="b28-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Biological synthesis is regarded as an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative for the production of biocompatible nanoparticles.<xref rid="b29-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The numerous publications reporting either living microorganisms, plants or cell-free extracts for the synthesis of nanomaterials highlight this rapidly expanding field of bionanotechnology.<xref rid="b15-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b30-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>In this study, we investigated the suitability of <italic>P. rhodozyma</italic> cell-free extract for AuNP and AgNP preparation, since this microbe contains an effective antioxidant, astaxanthin in high concentration, which promotes the formation of metal nanoparticles.<xref rid="b31-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> AgNPs and AuNPs were successfully synthesized and the biological activities of the as-prepared nanoparticles were subjected to complex analysis.

The symptoms can range from subclinical (eg, itching, rash), to serious inflammatory reactions (eg, blistering, scarring, alopecia), requiring distinct treatment regimens. Furthermore, the infective species can induce severe complications in immunocompromised individuals, including organ transplant, hematology and oncology patients where the infected area can manifest ulceration or even tissue necrosis.<xref rid="b3-ijn-13-695" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The severity of these symptoms should be attenuated by complementary management using topical treatment approaches.

We demonstrated that these nanoparticles are potent against cutaneous mycosis-causing dermatophytes and opportunistic yeast species and are non-toxic to human keratinocytes. Considering our data in the context of the current clinical results, the biocompatibility to skin cells and the outstanding antifungal performance of our biosynthesized nanoparticles might be exploited during topical treatment of cutaneous mycosis or as a prophylactic treatment against the recurrence of the infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This
