However, local failure after irradiation remains a challenge due to intrinsic and acquired resistance of tumor cells to radiation treatment. Radiation not only eradicates tumor cells through DNA damage and apoptosis, but also influences cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix by regulating receptors such as integrins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijn-7-915">1</xref></p><p>Integrins are composed of a single alpha and a single beta chain that have activated or nonactivated conformations. There are eight known beta subunits and 18 alpha subunits that can be combined to form over 24 known mammalian integrins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijn-7-915">2</xref> A substantial body of data support the view that integrins, such as &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>, play a critical role in regulating tumor growth and metastasis as well as tumor angiogenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijn-7-915">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijn-7-915">4</xref> &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> is expressed on the surface of a variety of cells, including endothelial cells and certain tumor cells in human malignant melanoma, breast cancer, and advanced glioblastoma. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijn-7-915">4</xref> Integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> expression not only affects tumor radiosensitivity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijn-7-915">5</xref> but is also associated with acquired radioresistance through the upregulation of integrin expression by radiation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijn-7-915">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijn-7-915">7</xref> Therefore, targeting integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> has received relatively more attention due to its role as a potential target for inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijn-7-915">3</xref> Arginine (R)-glycine (G)-aspartate (D) (RGD) is the most effective and widely used peptide sequence for stimulating cell adhesion on synthetic material surfaces. The RGD sequence is present in many extracellular matrix proteins and can interact with integrin receptors at focal adhesion points. Once the RGD sequence is recognized and bound to integrins, it initiates an integrin-mediated cell adhesion process and activates signal transduction between the cell and extracellular matrix, thus influencing cell behavior on the substrate (eg, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, survival, and migration).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijn-7-915">8</xref> Cyclic RGD-containing pentapeptides, such as cilengitide, are the most commonly used integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> inhibitors and enhance the response of different cancer cells to irradiation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijn-7-915">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijn-7-915">10</xref></p><p>Although it is anticipated that RGD peptides will be very promising as radiosensitizers, success in enhancing the radiotherapeutic ratio for cancer depends on increasing tumor cytotoxicity while simultaneously reducing harmful effects on normal tissues. An ideal strategy would be to identify a radiosensitizer that preferentially and effectively enhances the process of radiation-induced cell death in tumor cells which can be coupled with a delivery system that will increase inhibition of tumor tissues in a targeted way without affecting normal tissue. Recently, there have been efforts to develop a nanomedicine that actively targets cancer cells and contains effective anticancer drugs to exploit cancer-specific molecular targets.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijn-7-915">11</xref> Nanotechnology is an emerging technique for improved cellular targeting and radiosensitization. Gold nanorods are widely used as delivery vehicles to carry chemotherapeutic agents or radiosensitizers to malignant cells in the treatment of cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijn-7-915">12</xref> Gold nanorods have low cytotoxicity, robust stability, biocompatibility, and suitable physiochemical parameters, and some studies have reported that gold nanorods functionalized with drug molecules show substantially expanded performance as efficient therapeutic drug carriers. The use of structurally modified gold nanorods is less toxic to normal tissue during delivery, and at the molecular level, could traverse biologic barriers and preferentially accumulate in cancer cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijn-7-915">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijn-7-915">14</xref> Achieving the development of a competent cancer nanomedicine may bring new hope to cancer patients.</p><p>The present study investigated the benefit of combining RGD-conjugated gold nanorods (RDG-GNRs) that target integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> with irradiation in melanoma cancer cells, and also considered some possible mechanisms for the radiosensitizing effects of RGD-GNRs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of RGD-GNRs</title><p>The gold nanorods were synthesized using the seed-mediated template-assisted protocol,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijn-7-915">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijn-7-915">16</xref> by reducing gold salt in the presence of surfactant-directed synthesis.

Since CTAB is a necessary structure-directing agent in the gold nanorod synthesis method, severe cytotoxicity and low stability are still two problems which CTAB-coated gold nanorods need to solve. One of the solutions to these problems is depositing an additional coating on the surface of CTAB-coated gold nanorods.

Likewise, increased cell numbers in the G2/M phase could also explain some of the increase in susceptibility to radiation- induced DNA damage reflected by increased expression of the DNA repair protein, &#x003b3;H2AX, compared with cells treated with radiation alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijn-7-915">28</xref> Our results demonstrate that disruption of the cell cycle phases by RGD-GNRs might determine the relative radiosensitivity of A375 cells.</p><p>The radiosensitizing effect by RGD-GNRs might also be explained by inhibition of integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> expression. A375 melanoma cells that overexpress the integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>, show elevated levels of the protein following irradiation. RGD-GNRs, which with the cells were preincubated, inhibited the expression of spontaneous and radiation-induced expression of integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and presumably resulted in the sensitization of the cells to radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-7-915">Figure 4</xref>). There are a number of pathways in melanoma cells that contribute to radiation resistance, one of which may involve integrin-stimulated pathways. It has been reported that the impact on cell survival and cell cycle progression in mammalian cells by irradiation is strictly controlled by integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and the binding of growth factors to their cognate receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijn-7-915">29</xref> Integrin-stimulated pathways are similar to and intimately coupled with those pathways triggered by growth factors, eg, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijn-7-915">30</xref> Some studies indicate that a direct interplay between &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and VEGFR-2 occurs at the biochemical level.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijn-7-915">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijn-7-915">31</xref> High VEGFR2 induces a highly specific radioprotective effect toward &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin-positive endothelial cells in the tumor;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijn-7-915">32</xref> this results in promoting intrinsic radioresistance. On the other hand, radiation upregulates &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> expression and activates Akt, the key antiapoptic protein kinase in endothelial cells, thus forming a defense mechanism and survival signal against radiation damage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijn-7-915">9</xref> This may account for the acquired radioresistance of tumor cells after radiotherapy. Therefore, inhibition of integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> survival signaling by RGD-GNRs may lead to the reversal of tumor cell resistance to radiotherapy, which is a way to enhance the antitumor effects of radiotherapy.</p><p>Gold nanorods not only serve as an RGD delivery system to improve selective binding to tumor cells and minimize damage to surrounding normal tissue, but also have other interesting properties, such as increasing the absorption of radiation energy and their preferential accumulation in cancer cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijn-7-915">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijn-7-915">33</xref> It has long been realized that the effect of a defined dosage is increased when a high-Z material is in the targeted zone through a photoelectric effect,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijn-7-915">34</xref> of which the enhancement is proportional to the amount of the high-Z material. Nevertheless, most studies have focused on low-energy radiation because materials with a high atomic number, such as gold, preferentially absorb kilovoltage x-rays. Megavoltage x-rays, used in the present studies, are more commonly used in the clinic, particularly for deep-seated tumors. Therefore, the radiosensitizing effect of mV x-rays cannot be attributed to high-Z materials alone. Roa et al reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijn-7-915">35</xref> that one possibility, in agreement with present day data, is an interaction between gold nanorods and the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-7-915">Figure 5</xref>). Another possible mechanism is that gold nanorods, when irradiated in the cell, produce a high level of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which leads to elevated levels of oxidative stress and is manifested as an increased level of apoptosis compared with irradiation alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijn-7-915">36</xref> An additional hypothesis proposed as a result of work in DNA plasmid models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijn-7-915">28</xref> is that sensitization occurs due to short-range electrons produced by the interaction between gold nanorods and mV x-rays. The increased production of low-energy electrons close to the DNA causes more damage than radiation alone. Our data confirm that gold nanorods plus radiation induced more apoptosis and mitotic death in A375 cells than radiation alone, and also showed that this effect could be significantly enhanced by conjugating the gold nanorods to RGD.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that RGD-GNRs have remarkable potential to enhance radiotherapy of melanoma cancer cells. RGD-GNRs, in combination with 6 MV irradiation, enhance the radiosensitivity of the cells. This radiosensitizing effect may be attributable to alterations in the capacity of the cell to resist apoptosis caused by RGD-GNRs, mainly through downregulation of radiation-induced &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Because the success of radiotherapy for patients with melanoma largely depends on tumor radiosensitivity, the combination of RGD-GNRs and radiation needs further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This article was funded by research grants (09JC411900, 09411951100, 08411960600) from the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81171377), National Basic Research Program of China (2011CB707504, 2010CB933903).
