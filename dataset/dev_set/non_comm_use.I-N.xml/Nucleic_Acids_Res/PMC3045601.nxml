In the present study, we further provide evidence for the existence of the G-quadruplex structure within this tract both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> using the dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprinting technique and nucleolin as a structural probe specifically recognizing G-quadruplex structures. We observed that the overall reactivity of the guanine residues within this tract toward DMS was significantly reduced compared with other guanine residues of the flanking regions in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> footprinting experiments. We also demonstrated that nucleolin, which is known to bind to G-quadruplex structures, is able to bind specifically to the G-rich sequence of this region in negatively supercoiled DNA. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis further revealed binding of nucleolin to the promoter region of the VEGF gene <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, our results are in agreement with our hypothesis that secondary DNA structures, such as G-quadruplexes, can be formed in supercoiled duplex DNA and DNA in chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic> under physiological conditions similar to those formed in single-stranded DNA templates.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The switch to an angiogenic phenotype in cancer cells is often mediated by increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a pluripotent cytokine and angiogenic growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). VEGF consists of two identical subunits and it binds to VEGF receptors on the surfaces of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The interaction of VEGF and its cognate receptors stimulates the proliferation, migration, survival and permeability of endothelial cells, promoting the formation of new blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). VEGF expression, which is frequently elevated in many types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>), is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and its expression is induced by a variety of factors, including hypoxia, pH, activated oncogenes, inactivated tumor suppressor genes and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>). The molecular basis of VEGF gene expression has been extensively studied by characterizing the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements and transcription factors involved in constitutive VEGF expression in human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). This study revealed that the proximal 36-bp region (&#x02013;85 to &#x02212;50 relative to transcription initiation site) is essential for basal or inducible VEGF promoter activity in several human cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). These <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements contain at least three Sp1 binding sites, which consist of a polypurine/polypyrimidine (pPu/pPy) sequence. The pPu/pPy tracts are overly represented in the proximal promoter region of many TATA-less mammalian genes, including EGF-R, c-Myc, VEGF, HIF-1a, c-Myb, malic enzyme, I-R, AR, c-Src, c-Ki-Ras, TGFb and PDGF A-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). These sequences have been proposed to be very dynamic in their conformation, easily adopting non-B-DNA conformations, such as melted DNA, hairpin structures, slipped helices or others, under physiological conditions, when there is negative supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17 B18">14&#x02013;18</xref>). In particular, G-rich sequences of these tracts have been reported to form parallel or antiparallel G-quadruplex structures consisting of two or more G-tetrads in the presence of monovalent cations such as Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Significantly, the polypurine (guanine) tract of the VEGF promoter contains at least four runs of three or more contiguous guanines separated by one or more bases, corresponding to a general motif capable of forming an intramolecular G-quadruplex: VEGF: 5&#x02032;-G<sub>4</sub> (C) G<sub>3</sub> (CC) G<sub>5</sub> (C) G<sub>4</sub> (TCCCGGC) G<sub>4</sub> (CGG)-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprinting, the DNA polymerase stop assay, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and molecular modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), our previous studies demonstrated that the G-rich strand in this tract within the VEGF proximal promoter is indeed capable of forming intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) which can be further stabilized by various G-quadruplex interactive agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). We also demonstrated the dynamic nature of this tract in the VEGF promoter region using <italic>in vitro</italic> footprinting experiments with DNase I and S1 nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Furthermore, the same study revealed that the identical changes in footprinting patterns by both nucleases in the presence of KCl were significantly enhanced by the presence of the G-quadruplex-interactive agent telomestatin, raising the possibility that telomestatin interacts with G-quadruplex structure(s) formed by the G-rich sequence within this tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). We also observed that selected G-quadruplex-interactive agents could inhibit the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of these genes in various human cancer cells, including kidney cancer cells, suggesting that the transcription of these genes can be controlled by ligand-mediated G-quadruplex stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Taken together, our previous studies provide critical support for the idea that G-quadruplex structures may play structural roles <italic>in vivo</italic> and therefore provide insight into novel methodologies for rational drug design.

DMS footprinting is known to be particularly useful for probing G-quadruplexes <italic>in vitro</italic>, because these structures require N7 of guanine and there is protection of the guanine residues involved in G-quadruplex formation from N7 methylation by DMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Nucleolin is an abundant nucleolar protein that has been implicated in remodeling the chromatin structure, rDNA transcription, rRNA maturation, ribosome assembly and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23">22&#x02013;23</xref>). Nucleolin is also reported to be a G-quadruplex binding protein that binds tightly and specifically to both the four-stranded and the two-stranded G-quadruplex DNA with a nanomolar dissociation constant for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Recently, we also found that nucleolin binds <italic>in vitro</italic> to the c-Myc G-quadruplex structure with high affinity and to other known quadruplex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Overall, the results of our study described here strongly support the presence of G-quadruplex structures in the promoter region of the VEGF gene both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The A-498 renal cancer cell line was obtained from ATCC and the cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media (GIBCO BRL) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid DNA</title><p>For <italic>in vitro</italic> footprinting of the VEGF promoter region, we used the supercoiled form of the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-VEGFP, which was constructed by ligating an 837-bp VEGF promoter region (&#x02013;787 to +50 relative to the transcription initiation site) into the KpnI and NheI sites of pGL3-basic basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DMS Footprinting of the VEGF G-rich single strand</title><p>The <sup>32</sup>P-labeled VEGF G-rich single strand d(CCCCGGGGCGGGCCGGGGGCGGGGTCCC) was denatured by heating at 90&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02009;min and then cooled slowly to room temperature for 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;h in 20&#x02009;mM Tris&#x02013;HCl buffer with 100&#x02009;mM KCl.

The formation of G-quadruplex structures requires N7 of guanine, which is subsequently protected from N7 methylation by DMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Consistent with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), DMS footprinting revealed that a unique G-quadruplex structure is formed in the G-rich single strand of the pPu/pPy tract of the VEGF promoter region. This tract has the capacity to form a unique intramolecular G-quadruplex structure in the presence of K<sup>+</sup>, which requires four guanine blocks (GR-I to GR-IV), consisting of 12 total guanines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). DMS cleavage of the VEGF G-rich single strand showed that three stacked G-tetrads formed by four G-stretches were protected from methylation by DMS (except one guanine residue indicated by an asterisk), whereas two guanine residues within the central loop showed hypersensitivity to DMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 1). We further examined G-quadruplex formation in the promoter DNA duplex of the VEGF gene (787 to +50) using <italic>in vitro</italic> DMS footprinting experiments with a supercoiled form of plasmid pGL3-VEGFP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B (lane 4), under supercoiled conditions DMS shows dramatically reduced reactivity within the four 5&#x02032;-end runs of guanines (bracket &#x02018;G4&#x02032;) on the G-rich strand of the pPu/pPy tract of the VEGF promoter region, where G-quadruplex structures are proposed to be present. In contrast, the flanking regions (Brackets &#x02018;UF&#x02019; and &#x02018;DF&#x02019;) of the proposed G-quadruplex-forming sequence show enhanced reactivity to DMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 4), presumably because of the presence of locally unwound structures at the junctions between normal duplex regions and stable secondary structures. Interestingly, a moderate reactivity of DMS toward some of the guanine residues from GR-III was found, suggesting a loop region of the G-quadruplex structures as observed in studies using a single-stranded G-rich DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 1). The reactivity of DMS toward the guanine residues within the complete G-rich region is normal in the linearized form of plasmid pGL3-VEGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lane 4), showing that negative supercoiling is required to drive the local unwinding of the pPu/pPy tract, allowing a specific G-rich region to form a G-quadruplex.

We first examined the effects of G-quadruplex-interactive agents on the expression of the VEGF gene in A498 renal carcinoma cells using TMPyP4 and TMPyP2, a positional isomer of TMPyP4 that has low affinity for G-quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> values for both TMPyP2 and TMPyP4 in A-498 cell lines were &#x0223c;50&#x02009;&#x000b5;M when their antiproliferative activities were assessed with the MTT assay. The treatment of A498 cells with 25 and 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;M TMPyP4 resulted in a significant repression of VEGF gene expression after 48&#x02009;h, while TMPyP2 did not cause a decrease in VEGF gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). This result suggests that the G-quadruplex-binding activity of TMPyP4 is responsible for reducing the transcription of the VEGF gene in the presence of TMPyP4. Next, <italic>in vivo</italic> DMS footprinting via LM-PCR of the G-rich strand of the pPu/pPy tract of the VEGF promoter was carried out to determine the presence of G-quadruplex structures within this region. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, genomic DMS footprinting analysis of the VEGF promoter revealed that the three guanine repeats at the 3&#x02032; side of the G-rich strand of the VEGF promoter were strongly protected, while remarkable DMS hypersensitivity sites <italic>in vivo</italic> were found at guanine residues located at the third guanine repeat (GR-III) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 1). This unusual hypersensitivity is believed to be the result of enhanced reactivity of DMS toward the guanine residues located in the loop region of the G-quadruplex structures formed within the pPu/pPy tract of the VEGF promoter region. A similar observation was made in <italic>in vitro</italic> DMS footprinting experiments using a supercoiled plasmid DNA as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B (lane 4). It is worthwhile to note that G<italic>-</italic>quadruplex DNA structures formed at this region <italic>in vivo</italic> might differ from those formed <italic>in vitro</italic> because two hypersensitive guanine residues in the GR-III from the <italic>in vivo</italic> protection experiment do not correspond to the loop guanines presented in our VEGF G-quadruplex model deducted from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. Densitometric scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) of the autoradiogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B revealed that DMS protection was only slightly enhanced within the same region of the G-rich strand following TMPyP4 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 2). This result suggests the presence of a permanently folded DNA structure into a G-quadruplex <italic>in vivo</italic> at the pPu/pPy tract of the VEGF promoter even in the absence of G-quadruplex-interactive agents, such as TMPyP4. Next, we performed ChIP assays to examine whether the recruitment of Sp1 and RNA polymerase II to the VEGF gene promoter is attenuated by TMPyP4 consistent with reduced transcription of this gene in the presence of TMPyP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The treatment of A498 cells with 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;M TMPyP4 for 48&#x02009;h resulted in decreased recruitment of Sp1 and RNA polymerase II to the VEGF promoter DNA as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D. This result suggests that the interaction of TMPyP4 with G-quadruplexes in the VEGF promoter would prevent the binding of Sp1 and RNA polymerase II to the VEGF promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, resulting in repression of the VEGF gene. These results also support our hypothesis that enhanced protection of guanine residues from methylation by DMS is not simply due to the increased association of nuclear proteins, but to the formation of G-quadruplex structures as well.

The G-rich strand of this tract contains four runs of at least three contiguous guanines separated by one or more bases, conforming to a general motif capable of forming an intramolecular G-quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Our previous studies demonstrated that this G-rich sequence is able to form an intramolecular propeller-type parallel-stranded G-quadruplex structure <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Our other study also revealed a significant change in the digestion patterns within this region with both DNase I and S1 nuclease after the addition of KCl and telomestatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), suggesting the possible interaction of the G-quadruplex-interactive agent telomestatin with a G-quadruplex-forming region within the VEGF gene in supercoiled DNA.</p><p>In this report, we have further examined the possible presence of G-quadruplex structures both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in the pPu/pPy tract within the proximal promoter region of the VEGF gene using DMS and nucleolin as chemical and protein probes, respectively. DMS footprinting has been widely used for fine mapping of the presence of G-quadruplex structures within G-rich single-stranded DNA since the formation of G-quadruplex structures requires the N7 of guanine, which is protected from N7 methylation by DMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Our recent study also demonstrated that DMS footprinting is useful for probing G-quadruplexes within the duplex DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). As demonstrated in this study, four consecutive guanine tracts at the 5&#x02032; side of the G-rich strand within the pPu/pPy tract of the VEGF promoter, which are predicted to be involved in the formation of the G-tetrad, show diminished reactivity to DMS under supercoiled conditions. By contrast, the immediate flanking regions of the proposed G-quadruplex-forming sequence show enhanced reactivity to DMS, presumably because of the presence of locally unwound structures at the junctions between normal duplex regions and stable secondary structures. Interestingly, guanine residues in a predicted central loop region showed hypersensitivity to DMS. Overall, our findings in the present study are in line with our hypothesis that G-quadruplex structures could be formed by the G-rich strand of the pPu/pPy tract within the VEGF promoter region and these structures might participate in the regulation of this gene&#x02019;s transcription.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> DMS-LMPCR footprinting of the G-rich strand of the pPu/pPy tract of the VEGF promoter also provided interesting information regarding the possibility of the presence of G-quadruplex structures within this region. As described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, most of the protected guanine residues correspond to those that are known to be involved in the formation of G-quadruplexes <italic>in vitro.</italic> This is consistent with the results of <italic>in vitro</italic> DMS footprinting of the G-rich strand in both a single-stranded and double-stranded form in supercoiled DNA. Furthermore, the presence of DMS-hypersensitive guanines within the loop region of the predicted G-quadruplex structures on the G-rich strand would reflect the presence of a stable G-quadruplex within the VEGF promoter region. However, two DMS-hypersensitive guanine residues within the GR-III do not correspond to the loop guanines presented in our VEGF G-quadruplex model deducted from <italic>in vitro</italic> DMA protection experiments. This implies the possibility that G<italic>-</italic>quadruplex DNA structures actually forming in this region <italic>in vivo</italic> might differ from those observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments<italic>.</italic> It is very difficult to experimentally determine the G-quadruplex structures that actually exist <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the possibility of the existence of different forms of G-quadruplexes <italic>in vivo</italic> cannot be completely excluded because the internal nuclear environment could differ from those <italic>in vitro</italic> with respect to ionic composition and concentration, pH, protein composition and concentration, polyamine concentration, etc. Interestingly, DMS protection was only slightly enhanced within the same region of the G-rich strand following TMPyP4 treatment, although the occupancy of both Sp1 and RNA polymerase of the proximal promoter region of the VEGF gene sharply decreased after a 48-h incubation in the presence of 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;M TMPyP4. We speculate that TMPyP4 might not significantly facilitate the formation of G-quadruplexes in this region, but would interact with the already-existing G-quadruplexes. The G-quadruplexes complexed with TMPyP4 could be more efficient than G-quadruplex structures alone in preventing the transcription components, such as Sp1 and RNA polymerase II, from binding to the VEGF promoter region, thus resulting in reduced expression of the VEGF gene. The result of ChIP assays also supports the notion that enhanced protection of the guanine residues from methylation by DMS in both untreated and TMPyP4-treated cells is due to the formation of G-quadruplex structures rather than the increased association of nuclear proteins.</p><p>In several previous studies, the abundant nucleolar protein, nucleolin, has been shown to bind both intra- and intermolecular G-quadruplex DNA with very high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), suggesting that G-quadruplex structures are binding targets of nucleolin <italic>in vivo</italic>. Based on these observations, we utilized a nucleolin protein as a structural probe to identify G-quadruplex structures formed within the duplex DNA both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in this study. In support of the pPu/pPy tract of the VEGF promoter region having similar G-quadruplex structures both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, DNase I footprinting of the plasmid pGL3-VEGFP revealed the binding of nucleolin to the G-quadruplex forming region of the VEGF promoter. A ChIP assay further confirmed the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding of nucleolin to the VEGF promoter region containing the pPu/pPy tract. The results presented here support the use of nucleolin for both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> structural probing to identify the formation of G-quadruplex structures within the G-rich sequences that affect transcription of many mammalian genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. The results with both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DMS footprinting experiments show that predictions of intracellular G-quadruplex structures, especially structures involving local interactions, can be made on the basis of <italic>in vitro</italic> reactivity of DMA toward the guanine residues involved in the formation of these structures.</p><p>Several lines of experimental evidence from previous studies support a potential formation of G-quadruplex structures in the promoter region of the VEGF gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Our findings from this study further provide strong evidence that the G-rich region within pPu/pPy tract of the VEGF promoter region could adopt stable G-quadruplex structures, which could be probed with DMS both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In conjunction with DMS footprinting, protein probes such as nucleolin, which specifically recognize G-quadruplex structures, could be used to investigate whether G-quadruplex structures are formed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> from putative G-quadruplex forming sequences. Our results also support the idea that nucleolin can function as a transcriptional regulator of mammalian genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), whose promoter regions are able to form G-quadruplex structures under physiological conditions. Thus, ongoing studies are in progress in our laboratory to define a possible role for nucleolin in regulating transcription of the VEGF gene. Although it is not yet known whether these noncanonical DNA structures can serve as a substrate for these transcription factors in an <italic>in vivo</italic> system, their specific interaction with non-B-DNA structures in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system suggests that alternative DNA conformations may naturally exist and may also play a crucial role in the regulation of many genes containing highly dynamic conformations in their promoter regions. Such alternative structures, although speculative at this point, may be of relevance for the new therapeutic approach that proposes the use of small molecule drugs as transcriptional regulators.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>The National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (<award-id>CA109069</award-id>); Arizona Biomedical Research Commission (ADCRC#8020).
