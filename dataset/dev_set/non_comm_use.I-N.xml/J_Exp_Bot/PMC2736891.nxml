Lutein and beta-carotene are the most abundant carotenoids found during fruit development, with beta-carotene concentration increasing rapidly during fruit maturation and ripening. In addition, the accumulation of beta-carotene and lutein is influenced by the temperature at which harvested fruit are stored. Expression analysis of carotenoid biosynthetic genes among different genotypes and fruit developmental stages identified <italic>Actinidia</italic> lycopene beta-cyclase (<italic>LCY-&#x003b2;</italic>) as the gene whose expression pattern appeared to be associated with both total carotenoid and beta-carotene accumulation. Phytoene desaturase (<italic>PDS</italic>) expression was the least variable among the different genotypes, while zeta carotene desaturase (<italic>ZDS</italic>), beta-carotene hydroxylase (<italic>CRH-&#x003b2;</italic>), and epsilon carotene hydroxylase (<italic>CRH-&#x003f5;)</italic> showed some variation in gene expression. The <italic>LCY-&#x003b2;</italic> gene was functionally tested in bacteria and shown to convert lycopene and delta-carotene to beta-carotene and alpha-carotene respectively.

Carotenoids are one such group of compounds that are synthesized in the plastids, mainly the chloroplasts and chromoplasts, by enzymes that are nuclear-encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirschberg, 2001</xref>). Carotenoids are 40 carbon isoprenoids that contain polyene chains containing conjugated double bonds. These compounds are important in nature as they are involved in light-harvesting, photoprotection, and pollinator attraction in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tracewell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Szabo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). They can accumulate to give attractive yellow, orange, and red pigmentation to some flowers and fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). They are also precursors of vitamin A, implicated in reducing the progression of diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, certain types of cancers, and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Babili <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DellaPenna and Pogson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aluru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Fruits that accumulate high levels of carotenoids therefore can potentially provide a rich source of these healthy compounds.</p><p>The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in plants is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cunningham <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirschberg, 2001</xref>). The first committed step is the condensation of two molecules of geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) to form phytoene, catalysed by the enzyme phytoene synthase (PSY). The colourless phytoene is subsequently desaturated to give zeta-carotene and lycopene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Norris <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). In bacteria, the desaturation of phytoene is by one enzyme, carotene desaturase (CrtI) but in plants, two enzymes, phytoene desaturase (PDS) and zeta-carotene desaturase (ZDS) are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). The carotenoid pathway branches at the cyclization of lycopene, which is acted upon by lycopene cyclases to produce alpha-carotene and beta-carotene. The formation of alpha-carotene requires the addition of an epsilon ring to one end of the linear lycopene molecule (yielding delta-carotene) by the enzyme lycopene epsilon cyclase (LCY-&#x003b5;), followed by the activity of lycopene beta-cyclase (LCY-&#x003b2;), which adds a beta ring to the other end of the chain. In contrast, beta -carotene results from the addition of two beta rings to both ends of the linear lycopene molecule by the lycopene beta-cyclase enzyme (LCY-&#x003b2;). The flux through the branches is thus dependent on the relative activities of the cyclases involved. In maize, polymorphisms in <italic>LCY-&#x003f5;</italic> were found to account for the accumulation of beta-carotene and xanthophylls derived from this carotene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harjes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Similarly, in the <italic>Arabidopsis lut1</italic> and <italic>lut2</italic> mutants, in which lutein accumulation is reduced or completely absent, there is an increased accumulation of beta-ring-containing carotenoid compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pogson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Overexpression of beta-carotene hydroxylase in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> increased the concentrations of xanthophylls without any significant reduction in the amount of other carotenoids, suggesting genetic manipulation of a single step can increase flux through the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davison <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in plants.

The introduction of the <italic>Narcissus</italic> (daffodil) phytoene synthase (<italic>PSY</italic>), lycopene cyclase (<italic>LCY</italic>), and bacteria <italic>CRTI</italic> genes into rice produced a beta-carotene-rich variety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Similarly, the co-expression of the daffodil <italic>PSY</italic> and bacteria <italic>CRTI</italic> genes increased beta-carotene rather than lycopene in rice endosperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Babili <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This suggests that the carotenoid pathway in rice is limited by the enzyme steps converting phytoene to lycopene that were complemented by the introduction of heterologous genes through transformation.</p><p><italic>Actinidia</italic> spp. (kiwifruit) show a considerable variation in fruit colour. The common commercial species are green-fleshed <italic>Actinidia deliciosa</italic> and yellow-fleshed <italic>Actinidia chinensis</italic>. However, there are other species currently unavailable commercially that accumulate extremes of anthocyanin and carotenoid pigments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). As some green-fleshed <italic>Actinidia</italic> genotypes ripen, chlorophyll is degraded in the skin and flesh to reveal different pigmentation contributed by carotenoids and anthocyanins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Montefiori <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). There is little known about the distribution of carotenoid accumulation in kiwifruit or the alleles responsible for the inheritance of these potentially desirable variations in appearance. Such knowledge would be valuable to plant breeders, given the challenges of developing new kiwifruit varieties in a genus that is both dioecious and exhibits extensive variation in ploidy.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Fruit of the <italic>Actinidia</italic> genotypes used in this study.

In addition, candidate genes that code for key steps in this biochemical pathway were identified in kiwifruit and expression patterns analysed. Our results suggest that the major carotenoids that accumulate in kiwifruit are beta-carotene and lutein and that the levels of beta-carotene are controlled by the transcriptional activity of the lycopene beta-cyclase gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><p>Kiwifruit varieties were selected from mapping and breeding populations available in New Zealand.

In contrast, alpha-carotene was at very low levels. Among the xanthophylls accumulating in kiwifruit, lutein was present at relatively high levels, while the beta-xanthophylls such as zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin were present at very low levels. The high levels of beta-carotene and lutein are similar to those described in other fruit crops such as capsicum, mango, and papaya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Veda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In all the kiwifruit selections studied, the linear carotenes such as phytoene, zeta-carotene, and lycopene were not detected.

It is not clear what specifies the types of compounds that accumulate in different species. However, low concentrations of linear carotenoids could be due to efficiency of enzymatic conversion of these molecules or an indication of an upstream limiting factor. In kiwifruit, the cDNA of phytoene synthase was not found in an EST database of more than 100 000 sequences, so a degenerate PCR approach was required to clone this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crowhurst <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This enzyme, committed to the condensation of geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate to form phytoene is thought to be a rate-limiting factor in carotenoid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giuliano <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fraser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). However, downstream carotenoid compounds were found to accumulate to high levels in kiwifruit, suggesting that the first enzyme step is active in this species.</p><p>The accumulation of downstream compounds such as beta-carotene and lutein in kiwifruit, combined with the undetectable levels of phytoene, zeta-carotene, and lycopene, suggest efficient enzyme activities at those intermediate steps. In tomato, the early enzyme steps have a significant influence over the flux. The activities of the desaturation enzymes in the pathway leading to lycopene seem to increase while the cyclization steps, downstream of lycopene, are reduced resulting in lycopene accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraser <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994, 2002</xref>). Similarly, when transgenes of PSY and CRTI (<italic>Erwinia uredovora</italic>) were introduced into rice, there was accumulation of beta-carotene instead of the expected lycopene, indicating the presence of an efficient endogenous cyclase activity in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Babili <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schaub <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although the mechanisms that influence the level and distribution of carotenoid or the relative distribution of carotenoid compounds are not well known, it can be hypothesized that the relative activities of LCY-&#x003b2; and LCY-&#x003b5; might serve to apportion the flux into the two branches of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cunningham <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pecker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>).

However, a more detailed kinetic analysis of the various LCY-&#x003b2; enzymes is required to determine if these differences are responsible for the accumulation pattern of beta-carotene in the kiwifruit genotypes.</p><p>The concentration of beta-carotene generally increased with developmental stage. Carotenoids accumulated to a greater concentration during fruit ripening. This is consistent with the pattern observed in other plants such as mango, pepper, and papaya in which carotenoid accumulation is developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fabi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Kiwifruit stored at room temperature ripened quickly and accumulated carotenoids to high concentrations while cold storage inhibited carotenoid accumulation. Apparently, the conditions that inhibit the fruit-ripening process also inhibit carotenoid accumulation, as observed in other fruit types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neta-Sharir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gil <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Perkins-Veazie and Collins, 2006</xref>).

In this study, it was found that expression of key biosynthetic genes were temperature sensitive and account for these carotenoid accumulation patterns. This has significance for the post-harvest storage of fruit and its effect on market quality.</p></sec><sec><title>Carotenoid accumulation in kiwifruit is controlled by gene expression</title><p>The expression of the carotenoid biosynthetic genes explains the different carotenoid accumulation patterns seen in the kiwifruit genotypes.

These results combine to suggest that carotenoid biosynthesis may be controlled differently in different species of plants.

The major carotenoid was found to be beta-carotene and its accumulation was controlled by the increased expression of the <italic>ZDS</italic> and <italic>LCY-&#x003b2;</italic> genes and the down-regulation of <italic>LCY-&#x003f5;,</italic> and <italic>CRH-&#x003b2;</italic> genes, suggesting these are important regulatory steps in the kiwifruit carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. The differences in gene expression observed among the genotypes may be due to differential regulation of these genes, which requires further investigation to help us understand fruit carotenoid accumulation in kiwifruit.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Kiwifruit Royal Investment Programme (KRIP) funding KRIP06-46 from Plant and Food Research.
