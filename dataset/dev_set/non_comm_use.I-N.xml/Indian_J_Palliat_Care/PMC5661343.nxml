Integrating palliative care with gynecologic oncology will help prioritize patient needs and establish goals of care. Thus, the present retrospective study was conducted to assess the frequency of symptoms in gynecological malignancies presenting to the palliative medicine clinic.

Our data also revealed that (<italic>n</italic> = 12, 6.12%) patients belonged to younger age group of patients (11&#x02013;30 years age group). Of the patients referred to palliative care, 153 patients (78.06%) were in Stage III and IV and 43 patients (21.93%) were in the early stages (Stage I/II) of the disease [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

However, this was statistically significant for only nausea/vomiting and fatigue [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Among cancer diagnosis, ovarian cancer accounted for large proportion of referrals (<italic>n</italic> = 89, 45.41%) followed by cervical cancer (<italic>n</italic> = 60, 30.61%).

In the present study, we have demonstrated that large proportion of patients presenting to our department had high symptom burden. Among the symptoms, pain (70.04%) was the most common followed by anorexia (34.13%) and fatigue (28.57%). The prevalence of pain in our study population corroborated with another study where the authors reported a prevalence of 71%. A systematic review of 46 studies including 25000 patients belonging to the palliative cancer subpopulations reported fatigue as the most common symptom (74%) followed by pain in 71% of patients, dyspnea in 35% of patients (7.14% in our study), and nausea in 31% (15.81% in our study) of patients.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Among 45,118 cancer patients (including 3985 gynecologic cancer patients), Barbera <italic>et al</italic>. found the following symptom prevalence among all cancer patients: Fatigue 75%, anxiety 57%, depression 44%, and pain 53%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The younger patients had a higher prevalence of pain and other symptoms as compared to the older patients. However, the association between age and symptom prevalence is conflicting with some studies finding higher pain intensities among the younger age group[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and others reporting no relationship between age and symptom intensity.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A possible explanation for younger patients to report more symptoms could be due to the administration of more aggressive treatment to the younger patients as compared to the older patients and a lesser number of older patients reporting cancer-related symptoms.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Most common reasons for referral to palliative care was for pain management (50.51%) followed by &#x0201c;progressive disease&#x0201d; (45.41%). However, referral for symptom management other than pain was very low (5.10%); although, there was a high burden of symptoms at the time of assessment by the palliative care physician. This discrepancy could be explained by the oncologist's limitation at recognizing these symptoms as distressing which in turn could be due to a limitation in the time available for consultation and sparse resources.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Furthermore, the oncologists often delay the referral to palliative care in India as the felt need for palliative care service is often for the end of life care once all options for cure have been exhausted. A large proportion of patients (64.79%) referred to us had good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 0, 1, 2) which counters the traditional concept of referral when symptoms affect the activities of daily living (ECOG 3, 4, 5).</p><p>The median duration from the time of registration to the hospital to referral to palliative care was 123 days. In a study by Dalal <italic>et al</italic>., the median duration from registration in the hospital to referral to palliative care was 187 days.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] There is evidence to prove that patients presenting to oncologists at the time of palliative intent of cancer directed treatment are as symptomatic as those who present to the palliative care outpatient clinic, warranting the need for early symptom management.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, the delayed referrals to palliative care are compounded by multiple physician and patient-related factors.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The oncologists misconstrue that referring to palliative care could destroy hope in the patient.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] This in addition to lack of clarity about the disease process, possibility of periods of remission, inadequate communication skill, and lack of knowledge about palliative care delay the referral to palliative care.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] A study revealed that proportionately less number (&#x0003c;10%) of patients and family consider the option for palliative care.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] This could be justified by their heightened expectations for survival, sense of denial and desire to focus on cancer directed treatment.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In a study at a US cancer center, one-third of physicians indicated that they would likely refer earlier if palliative care was renamed supportive care[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and there was a demonstrable difference in the referral patterns of palliative care service.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>There has been a changing trend in referral patterns and acceptance for initiating early palliative care by some oncologists. Although large proportions 78.06% of the patients were in their late stage (Stage III/IV) of a cancer diagnosis; 21.93% of patients referred to palliative care belonged to early stage (Stage I/II) of cancer. The finding corroborates with a study by Dalal <italic>et al</italic>., where the author reported a rising trend in the referral of patients with nonadvanced cancer to palliative care; from 12% in 2007 to 21% in 2013. Awareness about palliative care, the involvement of palliative care physician in the multidisciplinary team and changing attitudes and beliefs of referring oncologist could have contributed to this transition.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The study had some limitations that it included retrospective analysis of data and it did not include other comorbidities that may have contributed to symptom burden. Our results are also limited by nonresponse bias including the possibility that patients with greater symptom burden may have presented to palliative care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>High symptom prevalence in our patients represents a high burden of suffering that is amenable to intervention. It is thus imperative that a robust palliative care referral system be initiated at any stage in the disease trajectory for patients with physical or psychological symptoms. Successfully addressing this significant symptom burden will likely require a multipronged approach; with collaboration between gynecologic oncology teams providing &#x0201c;primary palliative care&#x0201d; and palliative care team to provide &#x0201c;specialty palliative care.&#x0201d; This model will ensure that every patient with high symptom burden receives adequate screening of symptoms and appropriate referral to specialized palliative care with demonstrable improvement in the overall well-being of the patients.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and
