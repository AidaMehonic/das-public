However, human antifungal immunity remains poorly defined. Here, by integrating transcriptional analysis and functional genomics, we identified <italic>Candida</italic>-specific host defense mechanisms in humans. <italic>Candida</italic> induced significant expression of genes from the type I interferon (IFN) pathway in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This unexpectedly prominent role of type I IFN pathway in anti-<italic>Candida</italic> host defense was supported by additional evidence. Polymorphisms in type I IFN genes modulated <italic>Candida</italic>-induced cytokine production and were correlated with susceptibility to systemic candidiasis. In <italic>in-vitro</italic> experiments, type I IFNs skewed <italic>Candida</italic>-induced inflammation from a Th17-response toward a Th1-response. Patients with chronic mucocutaneaous candidiasis displayed defective expression of genes in the type I IFN pathway. These findings indicate that the type I IFN pathway is a main signature of <italic>Candida</italic>-induced inflammation and plays a crucial role in anti-<italic>Candida</italic> host defense in humans.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3"><italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<italic>C. albicans</italic>) is a commensal microorganism that inhabits human skin and mucosa. <italic>Candida</italic> can be isolated from up to 70% of the general population at any given moment, and it is believed that all individuals have been colonized with <italic>Candida</italic> at a some point<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Although it is a commensal organism, <italic>C. albicans</italic> can also cause mucosal and systemic infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Despite the availability of novel classes of antifungal agents (e.g., azoles, echinocandins), mortality due to systemic candidiasis, the fourth most common form of sepsis<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, reaches 37-44%<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In addition, vaginal and oral candidiasis can also occur in healthy or only mildly immunocompromised individuals<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, with up to 5% of women in the general population suffering from recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Despite the introduction of modern antifungal drugs and intensive care facilities, progress in improving the outcome of <italic>Candida</italic> infections in the last decade has been disappointing. Given this lack of progress, it is currently believed that only adjuvant immunotherapy will be able to further reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality caused by <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Understanding the host defense pathways involved in candidiasis is therefore crucial for identifying novel targets for immunotherapy. To date, all investigations aimed at identifying antifungal host defense mechanisms in humans have relied on candidate-target approaches that are based on biologic plausibility of hypotheses extracted from <italic>in vitro</italic> or animal studies. While this approach has been fruitful in confirming important pathways of antifungal defense, it has lacked the power <bold>to</bold> provide a hierarchy of the importance of these pathways, <bold>and to</bold> identify potentially novel and unexpected host defense mechanisms against <italic>Candida</italic>.</p><p id="P5">In the present study, we have taken an alternative, unbiased approach to this biological problem. Using a combination of transcriptional analysis and systems biology, we have stimulated human primary cells with the fungus, identifying <italic>Candida</italic>-specific transcription profiles in human immune cells. While <italic>C. albicans</italic> induced the transcription of multiple inflammatory gene sets commonly stimulated by other inflammatory stimuli, it also specifically induced several additional gene sets, among which we identified an unexpectedly strong type I IFN signature profile. We confirmed the importance of the type I IFN pathway for anti-<italic>Candida</italic> host defense in humans through immunological and genetic studies in both healthy volunteers and in patients with systemic candidiasis or suffering from chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Candida albicans</italic> induces a type I interferon response</title><p id="P6">We measured genome-wide transcriptional profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers upon stimulation with <italic>C. albicans</italic>, as well as with inflammatory stimuli unrelated to fungal pathogens: <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB), and RPMI culture medium as a control. Measurements were performed at 4 and 24 hours. 693 transcripts that showed &#x0003e;2-fold higher expression compared to corresponding RPMI stimulation were selected (BH-adjusted P &#x0003c; 0.05). K-means analysis identified profile clusters that indicated shared and specific genes that were differentially expressed in response to each stimulus. We grouped shared genes into signatures representing common early response genes (clusters 1, 6, 14, 27), common late response genes (clusters 2, 3), and common inflammatory genes induced by all stimulations (clusters 9, 21, 25) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">3</xref>).</p><p id="P7">More importantly, to identify a set of discriminatory features (from the 693 differentially expressed transcripts) that would be most informative of the state of <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation and could distinguish <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation from the other inflammatory stimuli, we utilized information gain (Kullback-Leibler divergence/relative entropy) feature selection, to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. We performed 10-fold cross-validation which stratifies the data into 10 random partitions in which each (in turn) is held out for testing and the remainder for training a Bayesian classifier. Class prediction was evaluated by computing the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC), which assesses true- and false-positive rates. A 101-transcript (95-gene) <italic>Candida</italic>-response signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) was defined using this supervised learning approach for class prediction, achieving an AUROC of 97.8%, which would indicate an excellent classifier performance with very high discriminative value. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the <italic>Candida</italic>-response signature further demonstrated good class separation on the basis of <italic>Candida</italic> status and stimulation duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). As a set, the 101 features collectively identify expression signatures that are informative of <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation across the 4-hour, 24-hour or both time-points that sufficiently distinguish <italic>Candida</italic> from the rest. Enrichment analysis for the 101-transcript <italic>Candida</italic>-response signature revealed a striking over-representation of the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway (p=3.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;35</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). This set of genes was strongly induced at both 4 hours and 24 hours of <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation and establishes a definitive <italic>Candida</italic>-responsive signature distinct from that observed with LPS, MTB or <italic>Borrelia</italic> stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Type I IFN SNPs modulate susceptibility to candidemia</title><p id="P8">In order to assess whether the type I IFN genes specifically induced by <italic>C. albicans</italic> in human leukocytes are indeed involved in antifungal host defense, we investigated whether common polymorphisms in a subset of these genes influence susceptibility to systemic <italic>Candida</italic> infections. From a cohort of 217 Caucasian patients with candidemia, well described elsewhere<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, we had Immunochip genotyping data available and 11 genes of the 101-transcript (95-gene) dataset were covered by the Immunochip array (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). We tested these 11 genes for association by taking immunochip data on 12,228 non-candidemia Caucasian healthy volunteers as controls<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Analysis of the loci associated with these 11 genes revealed significant association of genetic variation with susceptibility to systemic candidiasis in four regions: <italic>CCL8</italic> SNP 1kg_17_29697448 (p = 0.00069), <italic>STAT1</italic> SNP rs16833172 (p = 0.0042), <italic>SP110</italic> SNP rs3769845 (p = 0.012) and <italic>PSMB8</italic> SNP rs3198005 (p = 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-d</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">3</xref>, clusters 10, 11, 20, 11 respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). After applying a stringent Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, the association between susceptibility to candidemia and <italic>STAT1</italic> and <italic>CCL8</italic> remained significant. This finding confirms that the <italic>C. albicans</italic>-specific genes we identified in our transcriptional arrays play an important role in host defense against systemic fungal infections. We also attempted to assess whether the polymorphisms in these genes also modified disease severity. However, only 51 patients fulfilled the criteria of severe candidiasis based on clinical scores and persistence of positive blood cultures, and this number was too low for allowing the identification of significant differences between genetic variation and disease severity (disseminated disease, persistent fungemia and mortality at 14 or 30 days) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Type I IFN SNPs modulate <italic>Candida</italic>-induced cytokine responses</title><p id="P9">In an additional approach to validate the role of the type I IFN pathway for host defense against <italic>Candida</italic>, we isolated PBMCs from an additional group of 74 healthy volunteers and stimulated the cells with the fungus. Genetic variation in 11 type I IFN pathway genes present on the Immunochip was correlated with <italic>C. albicans</italic>-induced release of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17. In contrast to other microbial stimuli such as LPS and MTB, <italic>C. albicans</italic> induced higher levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-10 production, and lower levels of IL-8 and IL-6 in human PBMCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). The correlation of cytokine concentrations with genotypes at tag SNPs of <italic>Candida</italic>-induced IFN pathway genes revealed significant associations at <italic>IRF1</italic> and <italic>STAT1</italic> regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-d</xref>) in which <italic>IRF1</italic> SNPs were associated with TNF&#x003b1; (p = 0.0028) and IL-10 levels (p = 0.0024), while <italic>STAT1</italic> SNPs were associated with TNF-&#x003b1; (p = 0.001) and IL-6 levels (p = 0.0002). Consistent with the specificity of the type I IFN pathway for <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation, the association was significant with cytokine levels induced by <italic>Candida</italic>, but not by LPS or MTB stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Type I IFNs skew cytokine responses from Th17 towards Th1</title><p id="P10">To investigate the importance of type I IFN signaling in host defense against <italic>Candida</italic>, PBMCs from healthy individuals were stimulated with heat-killed <italic>C. albicans</italic>. In line with the transcriptional profile described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), IFN-&#x003b2; could be detected in cell culture supernatants only after <italic>C. albicans</italic> stimulation.

When PBMCs were stimulated with heat-killed <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the presence of an antibody against IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;/&#x003c9; receptor 1 (IFNAR), IFN&#x003b3; production was significantly lower compared to PBMCs stimulated in the presence of a control antibody. Blocking of IFNAR did not influence the production of the monocyte-derived cytokines IL-&#x003b2; or TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Conversely, adding IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b2; to <italic>Candida</italic>-stimulated cells increased IFN-&#x003b3; production, while significantly decreasing IL-17 and IL-22 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Together these data suggest that type I interferons (in the context of infection, most likely IFN-&#x003b2;) modulate the immune reaction induced by <italic>C. albicans</italic>, skewing host defense toward a Th1 response.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title><italic>STAT1</italic> mutations cause reduced expression of type I IFN genes</title><p id="P12">Patients with autosomal dominant CMC have increased susceptibility to mucosal fungal infections and often carry gain-of-function mutations in <italic>STAT1</italic><sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, which lead to STAT1 hyperphosphorylation, that in turn likely makes STAT1 unavailable for forming heterodimers with other STAT molecules<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. In co-cultures of DCs and T-cells from CMC patients, this led to defective Th1 and Th17 responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). In order to validate the role of <italic>Candida</italic>-specific genes in human antifungal mucosal defense, we assessed the expression of these genes in cells from CMC patients. PBMCs from healthy controls and CMC patients were stimulated with RPMI, <italic>E. coli-</italic>derived LPS, heat-killed <italic>C. albicans</italic>, or heat-killed MTB. The expression of type I IFN pathway genes (including <italic><bold>IRF5</bold></italic>, <italic>IRF7</italic>, <italic>ISG15</italic>, <italic>IFI44</italic> and <italic>IFI44L</italic>) that are induced downstream of STAT1-STAT2 showed patterns of defective expression in CMC patients compared to healthy controls, supporting a role of the type I IFN pathway in this immunodeficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The expression of <italic>IRF3, IRF9 and IFN-&#x003b2;</italic>, three genes in the type I IFN pathway upstream of STAT1-STAT2, was not decreased in cells from CMC patients. In fact, <italic>Candida</italic> induced IFN-&#x003b2; expression appeared to be higher in cells from CMC patients, possibly indicating a compensatory feedback mechanism.</p><p id="P13">In order to investigate the type I IFN pathway in CMC patients in a more systematic way, we also performed RNA sequencing analysis in PBMCs stimulated with <italic>C. albicans</italic> from both control volunteers and CMC patients. The differential expression of 91 genes in response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> stimulation was compared between CMC patients and healthy controls (10 genes from the 101-gene signature characteristic for <italic>Candida</italic> were not considered: 7 because another isoform was already used for FPKM calculations, and 3 hypothetical proteins without concordant refseq genes). In cells from healthy controls, two genes showed downregulation (<italic>LFNG, RGC32</italic>), while all other genes were upregulated upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>), validating the previous findings based on expression array analysis. In order to observe differences between patients and controls, the standardized fold change was used to create the respective heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The patients show a much lower standardized fold change in genes downstream of STAT1, again supporting the role of type 1 IFN pathway in CMC. We found 27 genes, from the set of 91 genes, to be significantly differently regulated upon <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation in patients compared to controls based on an ANOVA analysis (p-value interaction group and treatment &#x0003c;0.05) (MX1, OAS3, IFIT2, RTP4, XAF1, OAS2, IFI44, IFIH1, IFIT3, ADAR, PRIC285, FAM46A, SAMD9L, EIF2AK2, PARP12, TRIM22, ZBP1, HERC6, RSAD2, IFNG, OAS1, STAT2, DHX58, IRF7, TNFSF10, ISG15, HERC5). To determine the role of these 27 genes we calculated Gene ontology (GO) enrichment scores using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Enriched gene clusters were generated using Functional Annotation Clustering. Gene ontology terms associated with response to type I interferon and viral infections showed significant enrichment (p=1.09&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;14</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P14">The last decade has witnessed a significant increase in knowledge related to the mechanisms involved in antifungal host defense. However, most of this knowledge is based on <italic>in-vitro</italic> and animal studies; these studies led to hypotheses to be tested in human systems, leading to a somewhat biased view of human immunity against fungi. In the present study we have used a different approach based exclusively on complementary human studies: transcriptomics analysis in human primary cells, correlation of genetic variability and antifungal immunity in healthy volunteers (functional genomics), case-control association studies in patients with disseminated <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections, and assessment of antifungal immunity in CMC patients.</p><p id="P15">In our initial approach, we designed a hypotheses-generating set of experiments by assessing the transcriptional profile induced in circulating primary leukocytes by <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Human primary PBMCs were stimulated either with <italic>C. albicans</italic> or with other inflammatory stimuli. Pathway analysis of the genes induced by <italic>Candida</italic> indicated two broad categories: (i) a first set of genes that was strongly induced and shared by both <italic>C. albicans</italic> and other inflammatory stimuli (LPS, MTB, or <italic>B. burgdorferi)</italic>, constituted expected pathways involved in inflammation and innate immunity, many of which have important roles in antifungal immunity<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, and (ii) a feature set comprising an expression signature of 101 transcripts (95 genes) that distinguishes the <italic>Candida</italic>-specific response and is characterized by a strikingly strong and unanticipated type I IFN response.</p><p id="P16">Because the identification of the type I IFN pathway as the most prominent <italic>Candida</italic>-specific transcriptional signature was surprising, we initiated a series of studies to confirm this finding. Firstly, we assessed whether genetic polymorphisms in several of the genes identified in the <italic>Candida</italic>-specific dataset influenced susceptibility to systemic <italic>Candida</italic> infections. In a cohort of patients with candidemia that were genotyped using the Immunochip platform (Illumina<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>), on which 11 genes of the <italic>Candida</italic>-specific dataset were covered, we identified significant association of genetic variation with susceptibility to candidiasis in four of these genes: <italic>CCL8</italic> locus, <italic>STAT1</italic>, <italic>SP110</italic> locus, and <italic>PSMB8</italic> locus. This finding confirms that genes from the 101 <italic>Candida</italic>-specific dataset influence susceptibility to systemic fungal infections.</p><p id="P17">Secondly, the role of the type I IFN pathway for the anti-<italic>Candida</italic> immune response was subsequently validated in a study in which PBMCs isolated from a group of healthy volunteers were stimulated with the fungus. Genetic variation in the 11 type I IFN pathway genes present on the Immunochip was correlated with <italic>C. albicans</italic>-induced cytokine <bold>production</bold>. The correlation of cytokine concentrations with genotypes at tag SNPs of <italic>Candida</italic>-induced IFN pathway genes revealed significant associations at <italic>IRF1</italic> and <italic>STAT1</italic> regions, both crucial components of type I IFN pathway. We cannot exclude however that the effect of these polymorphisms on TNF&#x003b1; production are exerted through type II interferons; IFN&#x003b3; is stimulated by type I interferons<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, and is known to induce TNF-&#x003b1; production<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. These data support the hypothesis of the specificity of the type I IFN pathway for <italic>Candida</italic> stimulation, as this association was significant only for cytokine production induced by <italic>Candida</italic>, but not by other stimuli.</p><p id="P18">Thirdly, we performed classical immunological studies to assess the role of type I IFNs for <italic>Candida</italic>-induced immune responses, and we demonstrated that type I IFNs induced by <italic>Candida</italic> modulate Th1/Th17 cytokine profiles; IFN&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b2; increased IFN&#x003b3; production, while decreasing IL-17 production. Moschen et al previously demonstrated that type I interferons decrease IL-17 production <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> TNF-&#x003b1; production did not seem to be influenced by blocking the IFNAR, suggesting that genetic effects in STAT1 exert their effect on TNF-&#x003b1; production either through direct intracellular pathways, or indirectly through IFN&#x003b3;. Interestingly <italic>C. albicans</italic> seems to induce only IFN-&#x003b2;, rather than IFN-&#x003b1;, consistent with earlier studies in mice<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Finally, using both qPCR and RNA sequencing analysis, we demonstrated that the expression of type I IFN pathway-induced genes was defective in CMC patients harboring a gain of function mutation in STAT1<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. These mutations lead to increased STAT1 phosphorylation and IFN&#x003b3; signaling. Liu et al demonstrated increased STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN&#x003b3; stimulation in U3C cells transfected with mutated STAT1<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. They hypothesize that IFN targeted genes can lead to decreased IL-17 production. However, freshly isolated PBMC from CMC patients do not produce any IFN&#x003b3; in response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> stimulation<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is more likely that the inability of mutated STAT1 to form heterodimers with STAT3 and STAT4 causes defective Th1/Th17 responses<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, which are likely to represent the main immunological defect in this disease. Additional defects in the expression of type I interferon-induced genes, as shown here, may also contribute to the increased susceptibility to mucosal fungal infections. Whether this is truly caused by a defect in STAT1-STAT2 heterodimerization remains to be demonstrated.</p><p id="P20">Taken together, these complementary studies represent a compelling body of evidence that the type I IFN pathway is an important component of the immune response during infections with <italic>C. albicans</italic> in humans. Moreover, the data presented here are supported by emerging information from murine studies. For example, Bourgeois <italic>et al.</italic> and Biondo <italic>et al.</italic> have reported that mouse conventional dendritic cells produce IFN-&#x003b2; upon stimulation with <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and have proposed a role for MyD88, TLR7 and TLR9 in this induction<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. On the other hand, these results are relatively surprising, as no earlier study has reported a role for type I IFNs in human antifungal host defense. In this respect, primary immunodeficiencies in type I IFN pathway are mainly associated with viral, rather than fungal, infections<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, our data suggest that type I IFN defects determine an increase susceptibility risk for fungal infections, as demonstrated here by the association with candidemia in risk groups, rather than an overt immunodeficiency associated with severe fungal infections.</p><p id="P21">The precise effect of type I IFNs for anti-<italic>Candida</italic> host defense is still being debated. One study in type I IFNAR knockout mice suggested a deleterious role for this pathway<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, whereas another study reported that IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice die from their inability to control fungal growth<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. While type I IFNs play an important role in the immune response against viral infections<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, they seem to be deleterious in bacterial infections<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In humans with <italic>Candida</italic> infections, the role of type 1 IFNs is not yet settled, although the defects seen in type I IFN gene expression in CMC patients, the susceptibility to candidemia by <italic>STAT1</italic> polymorphisms, and the potentiation of Th1 responses by type I IFNs, all suggest a beneficial effect of the type I IFN pathway in human antifungal host defense.</p><p id="P22">Although viruses have long been known to induce type I IFN production, other microorganisms have been recently reported to induce this pathway. MTB stimulation induces the expression of <italic>IFNB</italic> and <italic>IFNA1</italic> in human macrophages<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>; type I IFNs are required for caspase-1 activation during <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> infection<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>; and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> induces the transcription of <italic>IFNB</italic> in macrophages<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. However, the complete transcriptional profile of the type I IFN pathway performed here shows important differences from the type I IFN profile induced by MTB <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and is significantly more pronounced for <italic>Candida</italic> than for MTB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). Interestingly, the very strong induction of type I IFN pathway genes by <italic>Candida</italic> may explain the well-known, yet unexplained, beneficial effects of injecting <italic>Candida-</italic>derived extracts for the treatment of warts in patients<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">In summary, this work presents complementary arguments from several studies to propose that the type I IFN pathway plays an important role in the immune responses to the fungal pathogen <italic>C. albicans</italic> in humans. The cross-validation between these approaches supports the value of this systems biology approach, combining transcriptomics with functional genomics and immunological data. Using this approach, we have confirmed the role of pathways known to be involved in antifungal host defense (e.g., common inflammatory pathways and the Th1/Th17 pathways) and we have identified a novel pathway (the type I IFN pathway). It is expected that this knowledge will have an important contribution in devising novel immunotherapeutic strategies for fungal infections, as well as influencing decision-making for vaccine design.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S9"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S10"><title>Study populations</title><p id="P24">For assessing the transcriptome and the cytokine production capacity, blood was collected after written informed consent from healthy volunteers.
