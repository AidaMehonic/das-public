However, the stroma-derived molecular determinants that modulate patient survival have yet to be characterized. Here we identify a stromal gene signature for advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer using microdissected stromal ovarian tumor samples and find that stromal microfibrillar-associated protein 5 (<italic>MFAP5</italic>) is a prognostic marker for poor survival. Further functional studies reveal that FAK/CREB/TNNC1 signaling pathways mediate the effect of MFAP5 on ovarian cancer cell motility and invasion potential.

Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common subtype and is highly lethal. Researchers estimated 21,980 new cases of ovarian cancer would be diagnosed and 14,270 patients would die of ovarian cancer in the United States in 2014 <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Although this disease is initially sensitive to platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy following debulking surgery, most patients experience recurrence within 12&#x02013;24 months and die of progressively chemotherapy-resistant disease. Markers that can be used to predict chemotherapy response and survival have yet to be thoroughly explored.</p><p id="P4">A critically important yet often overlooked component of tumor progression is the tumor microenvironment, which is composed of fibroblasts, extracellular matrix proteins, endothelial cells, and lymphocytic infiltrates. The tumor microenvironment can directly affect cell growth, migration, and differentiation via secreted proteins, cell-cell interactions, and matrix remodeling <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. It also promotes tumor initiation via transformation of normal epithelial cells and facilitates the progression of malignant cells, thereby presenting a unique challenge to diagnosing, understanding, and treating cancer. Previous large-scale transcriptome profiling studies, including The Cancer Genome Atlas, identified prognostic gene signatures for advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) using bulk or microdissected ovarian tumor samples <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. However, large-scale transcriptome profiles generated using the stromal component of ovarian tumors are lacking, and the prognostic significance of stromal gene expression in ovarian cancer cells remains largely unknown.</p><p id="P5">In the present study, we sought to determine the stromal signature of HGSC and identify specific genes that are associated with patient survival using microdissected tumor samples. We used a whole-genome oligonucleotide array to perform transcriptome profiling of the fibroblastic stromal components microdissected from a series of HGSC patients (informed consent was obtained from all subjects under protocols approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Review Board) to identify a transcriptome signature for ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Furthermore, we functionally characterized microfibrillar-associated protein 5, <italic>MFAP5</italic> (Previously known as microfibril-associated glycoprotein 2, MAGP2), a gene that we identified in the gene signature, determined its prognostic significance, and evaluated the molecular mechanism that mediates its effect on ovarian cancer cell motility and invasion potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ovarian CAFs express <italic>MFAP5</italic> at high levels</title><p id="P6">The stromal microenvironment is known to provide a niche that supports tumor growth <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. To identify mediators produced by the stromal microenvironment that support ovarian tumor growth, we performed transcriptome profiling of microdissected stromal and epithelial components of ovarian tumor tissues. Among the differentially expressed genes, we identified 19 upregulated secretory protein coding genes in the stromal component of HGSC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Microfibrillar-associated protein 5 (<italic>MFAP5</italic>), which we have shown to be amplified and overexpressed in a subset of ovarian cancer cells <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, was selected for further validation. Validation by quantitative real-time PCR revealed significantly higher levels of <italic>MFAP5</italic> mRNA expression in the cancer stroma than the epithelial components and normal ovarian stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Immunohistochemistry also revealed a higher level of MFAP5 protein expression in the cancer-associated stroma, particularly in CAFs, than in normal ovarian fibroblasts (NOFs) and ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed a higher endogenous level of MFAP5 in ovarian CAFs when compared to normal fibroblasts and ovarian cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Stromal MFAP5 overexpression predicts poor survival</title><p id="P7">To determine the clinical significance of stromal MFAP5 expression, we performed MFAP5 immunolocalization on 130 advanced HGSC samples.

Cox regression analysis with adjustment for age and debulking status confirmed the prognostic significance of stromal MFAP5 expression (hazard ratio, 2.603; p=0.001).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>CAF-derived MFAP5 stimulates cancer cell motility and invasion</title><p id="P8">Previous studies by our group revealed that MFAP5 could exert its effect on cancer cells in an autocrine manner via binding of its RGD domain to &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 integrin. To determine CAF-derived MFAP5&#x02019;s role in ovarian cancer progression, CAFs expressing high levels of MFAP5 were co-cultured with A224 and ALST ovarian cancer cells, which have undetectable levels of endogenous MFAP5 and high levels of &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 integrin expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).

To further validate the motility-stimulating effects of exogenous MFAP5, Boyden chamber based motility assays were performed on A224 and ALST cell lines. Increased migrated cells were observed in both recMFAP5-treated cell lines. Presence of anti-&#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 antibody attenuated the stimulatory effect of MFAP5 on cell motility (p &#x0003c; 0.01; two-tailed Student <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Data from the co-culture studies and exogenous MFAP5 treatment confirmed that the stimulatory effect of MFAP5 on ovarian cancer cell motility was mediated by its binding to the &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 integrin receptor.</p><p id="P10">In addition, A224 and ALST cells seeded onto Matrigel matrix with recMFAP5 resulted in three times the number of cells invaded through the matrix when compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), suggesting that MFAP5 also stimulated the invasion potential of the ovarian cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>MFAP5 stimulates cancer cell motility and invasion <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P11">To determine the effects of exogenous MFAP5 on ovarian tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, a MFAP5 overexpressing NOF line was generated.

One week after initial cancer cells injection, two <italic>Mfap5</italic>-targeting siRNAs and a non-targeting sequence were packaged in CH-NP and delivered via tail vein injection to luciferase labeled cancer cells bearing nude mice twice a week throughout the course of the experiment. Markedly lower luciferase activity was detected in <italic>Mfap5</italic> knockdown groups compared to the control group at week 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). At the end point of the study, necropsy revealed amelioration of cancer metastasis in the stromal <italic>Mfap5</italic> silenced groups when compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). <italic>Mfap5</italic> siRNAs/CH-NP resulted in a significant decrease in the number of metastatic tumor nodules found at mesentery, omentum, peritoneum, diaphragm, liver and spleen (p &#x0003c; 0.001; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test), tumor weight (p &#x0003c; 0.001; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test) and ascites volume (p &#x0003c; 0.001; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), suggesting that stromal <italic>Mfap5</italic> silencing inhibited ovarian tumor growth and metastatic spread. Primary tumor burden was quantified by measuring the primary tumor area in the ovaries using images of H&#x00026;E tissue sections prepared from tumors harvested from the three treatment groups. Similar primary tumor burdens were observed in the control and Mfap5-targeted animal groups suggesting that reduced metastasis observed in the MFAP5-targeting siRNA treatment group is the result from reduced cancer cell motility and invasive potential instead of reduced primary tumor burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>).

Troponin C type 1 (<italic>TNNC1</italic>) was chosen for further studies. TNNC1 contains a calcium-binding subunit and facilitates the interaction between actin and myosin in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells and the formation of stress fibers, suggesting that it may play a key role in mediating MFAP5&#x02019;s stimulatory effect on ovarian cancer cell motility. We performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis on five MFAP5-treated ovarian cancer cell lines and observed a significant increase in TNNC1 expression in all of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Results of motility assays demonstrated that silencing of <italic>TNNC1</italic> by a validated TNNC1-targeting siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 3B and 3C</xref>) abolished MFAP5&#x02019;s stimulatory effect on A224 and ALST cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), suggesting that TNNC1 is the effector protein for MFAP5-enhanced cancer cell motility. In addition, F-actin staining showed that recMFAP5 treatment led to an F-actin cytoskeleton with increased density and organization in ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>), but that these effects were abrogated in <italic>TNNC1</italic> siRNAs transfected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) suggested that MFAP5 stimulated cell motility via induction of TNNC1 expression and F-actin cytoskeleton reorganization.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>MFAP5 enhances Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and cell traction force</title><p id="P14">Transcriptome profiling and pathway analysis data suggest that cytosolic calcium mobilization is integral to MFAP5&#x02019;s effect on ovarian cancer motility. The observations that MFAP5&#x02019;s motility stimulatory effect was attenuated and F-actin reorganizing effect was abrogated in calcium chelator BAPTA/AM preloaded cancer cells (Figs. 5A and 5B), suggesting that calcium signaling is involved in modulating MFAP5&#x02019;s functions. Using the calcium dye Fluo-4 AM and confocal fluorescence microscopy, we observed that exogenous MFAP5 mobilized intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in A224 and ALST cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Further evaluation on the mechanisms involved in calcium mobilization in ALST cells showed that treatment with the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker nifedipine attenuated but did not abolish MFAP5-induced calcium mobilization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). The channel opener BAYK8644 triggered calcium mobilization in ALST cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>), suggesting that MFAP5 induced exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Also, treatment with the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor inhibitor xestospongin C but not the ryanodine receptor blocker attenuated MFAP5-induced calcium mobilization, suggesting that IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores are mobilized by MFAP5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 5C and 5D</xref>). Because IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion can trigger store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and is a common entry pathway in nonexcitable cells, we confirmed that an exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mechanism resembling store-operated calcium entry was present in ALST cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Since calcium mobilization is linked with increased cell traction force and with cell motility <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, we used traction force microscopy to evaluate MFAP5&#x02019;s effects on changes in cancer cells&#x02019; traction force. RecMFAP5 exposure induced an amplitude increase and cell traction force redistribution in A224 and ALST cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5D and 5E</xref>), suggesting that that directional traction force induction is the physical mechanism of MFAP5-enhanced cell motility and invasion potential. Furthermore, <italic>TNNC1</italic> silencing abrogated the amplitude increase of traction force induced by MFAP5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3D</xref>), demonstrating that TNNC1 is the key molecule involved in traction force induction by MFAP5.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>MFAP5 induces TNNC1 upregulation via the FAK/CREB signaling</title><p id="P16">Western blot analysis of key signaling molecules implicated in calcium-dependent pathways and <italic>TNNC1</italic> transcriptional regulation demonstrated increases in p-FAK (Y861), p-PLC-&#x003b3;1 (Y783), p-PKC&#x003b8; (T538), p-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204), p-CREB (S133), total Jun, and p-Jun (S63, S73 and S243) expression in MFAP5-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6A and 6B</xref>). Based on our results, we hypothesized that binding of MFAP5 to &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 integrin activates FAK. FAK activation activates PLC-&#x003b3;1 and PKC&#x003b8;, which regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization leads to ERK1/2 phosphorylation and subsequent CREB activation. Translocation of activated CREB to the nucleus leads to c-Jun transcription via binding of activated CREB to cAMP-response element (CRE) in the c-Jun promoter, which then upregulates TNNC1 expression. Increased TNNC1 protein expression thereby enhances stress fiber formation and cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To test the hypothesis, Western blot analyses were performed. Pretreatment with an anti-&#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 integrin antibody abrogated MFAP5-induced FAK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 6A and 7A</xref>) and PLC-&#x003b3;1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 6B and 7B</xref>), suggesting that &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 integrin is responsible for MFAP5-induced FAK and PLC-&#x003b3;1 phosphorylation. Previous studies showed that PLC-&#x003b3;1 phosphorylation is stimulated by both &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 engagement and the formation of FAK/&#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 complex <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. We therefore treated cancer cells with an FAK inhibitor to determine whether MFAP5-induced PLC-&#x003b3;1 phosphorylation is FAK-dependent. The results demonstrated that phosphorylation of p-PLC-&#x003b3;1 was attenuated in FAK inhibitor pretreated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 6C and 7C</xref>), suggesting that MFAP5-induced pPLC-&#x003b3;1 phosphorylation is FAK-dependent.</p><p id="P18">Next, we sought to determine whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in MFAP5-treated ovarian cancer cells is dependent on p-FAK&#x02013;mediated PLC-&#x003b3;1 and PKC&#x003b8; phosphorylation. Previous studies demonstrated that p-FAK induces PKC&#x003b8; phosphorylation by activating PLC-&#x003b3;1 <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Activated PLC-&#x003b3;1 increases hydrolysis of intracellular phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate to form two products: IP<sub>3</sub> and DAG. IP<sub>3</sub> induces endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum via IP<sub>3</sub> receptors, whereas DAG induces PKC&#x003b8; phosphorylation and activation.

<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. To determine whether PKC&#x003b8; activation is mediated by p-FAK in MFAP5-treated ovarian cancer cells, Western blot analysis of p-PKC&#x003b8; was performed. The level of p-PKC&#x003b8; expression increased in MFAP5-treated cells only in the absence of the FAK inhibitor described above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 6D and 7D</xref>). To determine whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization observed in MFAP5-treated cells was mediated by PKC&#x003b8; activation, cells were treated with MFAP5 with or without a PKC&#x003b8; inhibitor. The PKC&#x003b8; inhibitor decreased but did not eliminate Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5F</xref>), suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization is mediated only in part by PKC&#x003b8; activation.

While both MFAP5 treatment alone and MFAP5 treatment in the presence of DMSO solvent control enhanced motility of A224 and ALST ovarian cancer cells, pretreatment of cancer cells with a FAK inhibitor, ERK inhibitor, or CBP/CREB interaction inhibitor abrogated the motility promoting effects of MFAP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>).

Focusing on the epithelial component of HGSC, our group previously identified MFAP5 as a survival-associated target in HGSC. We observed <italic>MFAP5</italic> amplification and overexpression in a small percentage of advanced HGSC cases <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. In addition, we found that ovarian cancer-derived MFAP5 promoted tumor cell survival and stimulated endothelial cell motility and survival via the &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 integrin receptor. However, to our surprise, transcriptome profiling of the stromal component of HGSCs revealed that CAFs had much higher expression of <italic>MFAP5</italic> mRNA than did the normal ovarian stroma and epithelial components of ovarian tissue. In addition, immunolocalization of MFAP5 using a newly developed antibody confirmed that ovarian cancer stroma indeed has markedly higher levels of MFAP5 expression than did the epithelial component, which we did not observed in our previous study. This discrepancy is likely a result of the fact that stromal MFAP5 may be cross-linked with other proteins in the stroma more tightly during the formalin fixation process and requires higher antigen retrieval temperatures to re-expose the epitope recognized by the antibodies that have higher affinity to MFAP5. To strengthen the significance of CAFs as sources of MFAP5 in the tumor microenvironment, Western blot analyses on samples from immortalized CAFs, primary CAFS, as well as HGSG cancer cell lines were also performed. While some HGSC cell lines express a detectable amount of MFAP5, our data confirmed that CAFs are the major sources of MFAP5 in the ovarian tumor microenvironment. In addition, in cases in which tumor cells have low levels of MFAP5 expression but high levels of stromal MFAP5 expression, stromal MFAP5 secreted from CAFs may exert a paracrine effect on ovarian cancer cells and contribute to ovarian tumor progression. Our correlation studies demonstrated that epithelial and stromal MFAP5 expressions in tumor tissue were significantly associated with each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Therefore, it is not a surprise to find out that high levels of stromal MFAP5 expression, like the epithelial MFAP5 expression as reported in the previous study, were also significantly associated with poor patient survival. The significant association between stromal and epithelial MFAP5 expression suggests that MFAP5 is regulated by certain tumor microenvironmental cues in the same manner. However, the molecular mechanism by which stromal MFAP5 is expressed at high levels remains to be elucidated.</p><p id="P26">Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrated a significant increase in ovarian cancer cell motility and invasion potential but not cell proliferation after treatment with recombinant MFAP5 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 3E and 3F</xref>). To evaluate the role of CAF-derived MFAP5 on cell migration and invasion potentials <italic>in vivo</italic>, we developed a new model that allows for the interaction between MFAP5-secreting CAFs and cancer cells in the intraperitoneal microenvironment. In this model, a Matrigel plug embedded with MFAP5-secreting CAFs recapitulates a substratum through which cancer cells invade MFAP5-expressing CAFs in the tumor. The results of our study of this model demonstrated that Matrigel plugs with MFAP5 represent a better soil for cancer cells to invade. Effects of MFAP5 on cancer metastasis was further evaluated by injecting <italic>MFAP5</italic>-specific siRNA encapsulated nanoparticles into an orthotopic model in which ovarian cancer cells were injected into the ovary.

Treatment with an IP<sub>3</sub> receptor inhibitor but not a ryanodine receptor blocker attenuated MFAP5-induced calcium mobilization, suggesting that MFAP5 induces calcium release via the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor instead of the ryanodine receptor. This was supported by our finding that MFAP5 activates PLC-&#x003b3;1 phosphorylation, which may lead to hydrolysis of intracellular phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate to IP<sub>3</sub> and DAG.

Six weeks after initial injection, tumor volume of each treatment group was quantified by the IVIS&#x000ae; &#x02212;200 bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Inc., Hopkinton, MA). At week 8, the animals were sacrificed and necropsy was performed. The number, weight, and location of individual tumor nodules were identified and recorded.

Cells were seeded and cultured overnight. To evaluate the effect of exogenous MFAP5 on the traction force exerted by cancer cells on the substratum, cancer cells were treated with exogenous MFAP5 in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and a series of images of a single individual cancer cell was captured during the course of each experiment. A background image of the fluorescent beads was also taken after the cell was removed from the substrate. The LIBTRC library was then used to track the displacement of microspheres and compute the cell traction force. Total traction force (cell surface area&#x000d7;traction force per unit area) was normalized by the total traction force of the same cell before exposure to MFAP5 or HBSS. One cell was studied for each coverslip.
