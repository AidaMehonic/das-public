The risk of SCA/SCD and all-cause mortality associated with potassium concentration was evaluated at the time of cardiac catheterization (baseline) and most proximate to SCA/SCD events.

The ability to maintain normal serum potassium levels is diminished among patients with CKD, both due to decreasing capacity to excrete potassium and increased exposure to medications that impair normal potassium handling in the kidney (e.g., renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers and diuretics).<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Previous investigations among CKD patients have identified U-shaped associations between serum concentrations of potassium with increased risk of death and hospitalization<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>; however, no study has specifically examined the role of serum potassium levels in relation to the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and SCA among patients with predialysis moderate CKD.</p><p id="p0020">To further understand risk relationships among abnormal serum potassium levels, cardiac arrhythmias, and mortality, we explored the risk relationships between serum potassium disturbances and significant arrhythmic events among a large population of predialysis CKD patients with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk of SCA.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Description of Data Source</title><p id="p0025">Patients for this retrospective cohort study were identified using the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease (DDCD), which has been described previously.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In brief, this database compiled data on the clinical course of all patients who underwent a cardiac catheterization, an interventional cardiac procedure, or a coronary artery bypass surgery since 1969 at Duke University Medical Center. Patient information on physician-determined comorbidities, vital signs and symptoms at the time of cardiac procedure, and procedure results were collected at the time of treatment. Among patients with clinically significant CAD, the DDCD routinely collected follow-up data on mortality, cardiovascular events, and hospitalizations using mailed questionnaires and phone surveys at 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. Linkage to the electronic medical record and the medical claims data across the health care system allowed for extraction of additional clinical and demographic variables. In addition, vital status was determined through a search of the National Death Index. The Duke University institutional review board committee reviewed and approved the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Study Subjects/Design</title><p id="p0030">Consecutive patients who underwent cardiac catheterization between January 1, 1989 and June 30, 2014 and who were found to have clinically significant CAD (defined as&#x000a0;&#x02265;1 coronary arteries with&#x000a0;&#x02265;50% stenosis) with available serum creatinine data within 3 months of cardiac catheterization were included for analysis. eGFR (reported in ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was determined using the CKD epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine-based equation.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> All laboratory testing was performed at the core laboratories of a single institution. Serum creatinine was determined using the enzymatic Jaff&#x000e9; method. Patients were excluded from the study cohort if the cardiac catheterization was performed to evaluate congenital or pericardial disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or for assessment before organ transplantation. Because we discovered that data on serum potassium values were only sporadically available before 1999, we further restricted the cohort to patients who underwent cardiac catheterization on&#x000a0;or after January 1, 1999. Other specific exclusion&#x000a0;criteria are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>. A total of 6181 patients with reduced kidney function (defined as eGFR&#x000a0;&#x0003c;60&#x000a0;ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) were included in the final study cohort.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study flow diagram. eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Predictor</title><p id="p0035">The main exposure of interest for this study was the serum potassium level. Because previous studies consistently described nonlinear U-shaped relationships between serum potassium and cardiovascular outcomes,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> we modeled potassium as a categorical variable split into clinically relevant categories:&#x000a0;&#x0003c;3.5 mEq/l (low), 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/l (normal), and &#x0003e;5.0 mEq/l (high), based on normal reference values reported at our institution. Because potassium values vary over time, we assessed the association of serum potassium values with the risk of SCA examined at 2 different time points. First, we examined serum potassium levels at the time of cardiac catheterization (baseline) to assess the long-term predictive ability of potassium measurements. We defined baseline potassium measurement as the most recent measurement that occurred within 30 days before catheterization. For&#x000a0;&#x0003c;9% of our study cohort, there was no serum potassium measurement available in this time frame; instead, we used the closest potassium measurements that occurred up to 30 days after catheterization. Second, because of the more immediate effects of serum potassium levels on cardiac conduction and the risk of arrhythmia, we performed a matched case&#x02212;control analysis (see Statistical Analysis) to assess risk associations with the last measured potassium value proximate to an event of interest. Although we considered performing a time-varying covariate analysis, we were concerned that unequal follow-up among patients might bias the results.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Primary Outcome</title><p id="p0040">The outcome of interest was defined as a composite of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and resuscitated SCA. Two independent trained reviewers who were blinded to potassium values examined all deaths using data collected from family members, chart review of medical records, death certificate data, and query of the National Death Index. SCD was defined as deaths that were due to cardiac or unknown causes that occurred within 60 minutes of the onset of symptoms, as well as unobserved deaths that occurred in patients last seen alive &#x0003e;60 min before the discovery of death and the circumstances directly leading to the death were unknown. To identify resuscitated SCA events, we queried the medical claims database for the following diagnosis codes occurring at least 30 days after baseline cardiac catheterization: 427.5 (cardiac arrest), 427.4x (ventricular fibrillation/flutter), and 427.1 (ventricular tachycardia). Medical records linked to these diagnosis codes were then reviewed by 2 independent reviewers to (i) confirm the occurrence of a cardiac arrest event, and (ii) exclude cardiac arrests due to noncardiac causes, events that occurred in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, events among patients with a terminal diagnosis (life expectancy&#x000a0;&#x0003c;3 months), and events that occurred in the setting of a preceding invasive procedure or intensive care unit admission. Disagreements were resolved by the first author, who was blinded to the results of the initial review.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5"><title>Covariates</title><p id="p0045">Data on covariates were collected at the time of cardiac catheterization. These included patient demographics (age, sex, race), vital signs (blood pressure, body mass index), symptoms at the time of cardiac catheterizations, and physician-determined comorbidities. Serum potassium altering medication use by drug category was assessed at time of cardiac catheterization or within 7 days after the procedure. Available covariate data also included severity of CAD (number of vessels with &#x0003e;50% stenosis), measures of left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction assessed either by ventriculogram performed at the time of catheterization or by echocardiogram within 1 year before catheterization or no more than 6 months after catheterization), and interventions performed around the time of catheterization (percutaneous intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]), all which were associated with risk of SCA among CKD patients in previous analyses.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec1.6"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p id="p0050">The outcome, primary predictor, and covariates were summarized by level of potassium using means and SDs for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.</p><p id="p0055">The composite SCD and SCA outcome was regressed on potassium level (categorized) at baseline using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for all the previously described covariates. Patients entered the risk set at time of catheterization and were censored at the time of last follow-up. Covariates in the final Cox models consisted of eGFR, age, and body mass index at catheterization, sex, race (white, black, and other race), number of diseased vessels, history of diabetes, history of hyperlipidemia, history of smoking, and ejection fraction. Because overall mortality served as a competing event, we modeled the cause-specific hazards for SCD/SCA and overall mortality separately. Because of the absence of the important ejection fraction adjustor (21.4%) for all of the Cox models, we performed multiple imputation with fully conditional specification, with 5 imputations, and which included the primary predictor and all covariates.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p id="p0060">For the proximate serum potassium risk association assessment, data were analyzed using case&#x02212;control methods.

The patients were matched exactly on categorical variables, including the number of diseased vessels. For continuous variables, they were matched within 3 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> of eGFR, within 3 years of age, and within 3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> of body mass index.

In addition, the direct influence of abnormal potassium levels on mortality would be expected to be manifested as an increase in short-term arrhythmic event risks; thus, because of day-to-day variations in potassium levels, associations between a single baseline potassium level and long-term outcomes were likely to be confounded by other factors.

Although it was possible that the reason we did not observe a significant association between hypokalemia and SCD risk in CKD patients was due to the smaller number of events, it was noteworthy that relatively few (3%) SCD events were preceded by hypokalemia compared with the number of SCD events (16.7%) preceded by hyperkalemia.

Although this might limit generalizability because it was possible that a different relationship might exist among patients without significant CAD, a large proportion of CKD patients have significant CAD,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and our study findings highlighted the importance of serum potassium levels among a population with a high risk of SCD. Second, we examined outcome associations with serum potassium levels measured at 2 single time points: at the time of cardiac catheterization, and for a subset of patients, proximate to a SCA/SCD event. Because of the expected variation of potassium levels over time, this could have led to bias toward the null; despite this, we were able to demonstrate significant associations in our proximate time point analysis. Third, the lack of data on other covariates, such as serum magnesium and bicarbonate levels, time-updated ejection fraction measurements, and data on intervening nonfatal cardiac events between baseline catheterization and outcomes could have resulted in residual confounding; however, we adjusted our analyses using highly granular data on coronary anatomy, interventions performed at the time of catheterization, and other cardiac variables known to influence SCD risk. Fourth, although the number of SCA/SCD events (n&#x000a0;= 225) was large relative to other similar observational studies, this could have limited our power to detect significant differences between groups and also limited our ability to examine relationships between narrower categories of serum potassium; nevertheless, we were able to examine and detect significant associations among 3 clinically relevant categories of serum potassium levels. Finally, as with all observational studies, causative relationships could not be demonstrated.</p><p id="p0120">In summary, elevated serum potassium levels &#x0003e;5.0 mEq/l are common among patients with moderate CKD and significant CAD, and are associated with an increased short-term risk of SCA and SCD. Close monitoring of serum potassium levels and aggressive treatment of hyperkalemia among CKD patients with CAD may reduce the high risk of SCD.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0125">PHP and JPM received consultancy fees from Relypsa, Inc.
