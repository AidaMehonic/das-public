Recent research on early diagnosis and tumor therapy has focused on early diagnosis, early residual micro-lesion detection, anti-angiogenic therapy and non-invasive monitoring using specific molecular targets (such as &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;5), which are upregulated by tumor angiogenesis.</p><p>Application of effective contrast agents has been regarded as a feasible means to improve lesion detection rates and qualitative diagnostic capabilities. However, the commonly-used clinical contrast agents, such as gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION), have low sensitivity, a short half-life, and non-specific distribution, and they are difficult to modify, which is not conducive to early tumor diagnosis and the detection of micro-lesions <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.

Application of effective contrast agents has been regarded as a feasible means to improve lesion detection rates and qualitative diagnostic capabilities. However, current clinically-used contrast agents, such as Gd-DTPA and SPION, have a relatively low MRI sensitivity, a short half-life, and non-specific distribution. It is difficult to modify them with biological macromolecules and they are unsuitable as targeting ligands for molecular-targeting imaging <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Design and synthesis of high affinity MRI molecular probes targeting tumor specific molecules, resulting in extension of the half-life and an increase in sensitivity and targeting, is a highly desirable strategy to improve low MRI sensitivities, early tumor diagnosis, and micro-lesion detection.</p><p>In order to achieve tumor-specific targeted imaging, it is necessary to use a contrast agent with a smaller particle size and specific organization distribution, which can be achieved using nano-technology. Nanoparticles have the following unique advantages <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>: 1) Nanoparticles have unique nano-size (10-100 nm), which helps to reduce renal clearance, reticuloendothelial system (RES) absorption, and phagocyte recognition, which extends the circulation time and half-life. 2) Nanoparticles reach the tumor tissue through capillary endothelial cell gaps and passive targeting, and accumulate in tumors via an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. 3) Nanoparticles loaded with specific ligands that can recognize the molecules on tumor cell membranes to achieve active targeting. 4) Targeted nanoparticle transport can reduce cytotoxicity. The multifunctional polymeric micelles, which are synthesized using amphiphilic biblock copolymer and self-assembly, possess a unique core-shell structure. The hydrophilic shell makes micelles highly dispersible in a water-soluble internal environment and transferable to a specific location via the blood circulation, while the hydrophobic core can accommodate hydrophobic drugs or a controllable nano-drug release library using imaging contrast agents <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. In addition, the micelle diameter can be maintained in the range of 10-100 nm by controlling the polymer structure, MRI contrast agents and hydrophobic drugs that are encapsulated into the micelle core by hydrophobic interactions.</p><p>In this study, we used the polymeric micelles, PEG-PCL, as the carrier, connected its shell with the targeting ligand cRGD of the integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 receptor to obtain an active targeting effect, and loaded superparamagnetic &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> into the micelle core to provide supermagnetic sensitivity. In this manner, we synthesized the multifunctional &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-loaded cRGD-PEG-PCL micelles that are actively targeted to carcinoma vascular endothelial cells, and that have a small size and supermagnetic sensitivity. The block polymer characteristics were analyzed using a transmission electron microscope, <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra and mass spectrometry, which showed that the cRGD targeting ligand was successfully connected to the shell of PEG-PCL and &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were efficiently loaded into the core of block polymers. The synthesized polymeric micelles had a small size (about 50 nm) and supermagnetic sensitivity, and the R2 and R2/R1 were higher than the usual T2 negative contrast agents (such as Feridex) <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p><p>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> are superparamagnetic iron oxides, and we used &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in our study. In this study, we prepared &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-loaded cRGD-PEG-PCL micelles with various cRGD concentrations using the same molar ratio of hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic as in PEG-PCL to ensure the same length and number of hydrophobic PCL in each sample group. The polymeric micelle load capacity for &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was cRGD concentration-dependent, with the &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> load increasing along with increase in the cRGD concentration. The &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> encapsulation efficiency reached 10.6% when the cRGD concentration was 100%, which was about 2.7-fold higher than the non-targeting group, which had 0% cRGD concentration, indicating a better amphiphilic block polymer load capacity for &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and linking with cRGD. The load of cRGD did not significantly increase the overall size of micelle. Moreover, the relative increased average particle size means an increase in micelles with large particles and a larger hydrophobic core can accommodate more &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, resulting in an improvement of load and encapsulation efficiency. Since the surface area of the micelles increases by molecular exclusion of cRGD on the micelle surface, the micelle core becomes consistently looser, which contributed to a higher encapsulation efficiency with hydrophobic &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3.</sub></p><p>Prussian blue staining confirmed that the targeted micelles have better active targeting to in human hepatic vascular endothelial cells, resulting in more blue-stained iron particles in the T3A cells. Lack of active targeting to T3A cells in the non-targeting micelles, which did not have the targeting ligand cRGD connection, led to sparse blue-stained iron particles in the T3A cells. The integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 receptor binding sites on the cell surface reached saturation due to the high level of cRGD in the competitive inhibition group, which inhibited uptake of micelles into T3A cells.</p><p>In vitro MR imaging further confirmed that targeting micelles have an active targeting effect on human hepatic carcinoma vascular endothelial cells and can be monitored using clinical MRI. The tumor vascular endothelial cells can actively take up more micelles containing &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which was a result of specific binding to the targeting ligand, cRGD with tumor integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 receptors, in the targeting group. A significantly lower T2WI signal was detected in the targeting group, rather than the slightly lower signals in the non-targeting and competitive inhibition groups. T2 relaxation time in the targeting group was significantly shorter than in the other two groups.</p><p>The MTT results showed that the &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-loaded cRGD-PEG-PCL micelle can significantly reduce &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> cytotoxicity. The cells had a high survival rate and even proliferated in the presence of high iron concentrations (40 &#x003bc;g/mL), supporting the biological safety of synthesized polymer micelles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we successfully synthesized multifunctional polymer micelles with active targeting to carcinoma vascular endothelial cells. These micelles had a small particle size and supermagnetic sensitivity, and they were used as a drug-delivery system for imaging contrast compounds and anti-angiogenics. These results indicated that the &#x003b3;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-loaded cRGD-PEG-PCL micelle have better active targeting and low cytotoxicity on human hepatic carcinoma vascular endothelial cells, which can be monitored using clinical 1.5 T MRI scanner.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81271561, 30900357), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2015A030313173).</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other"><collab><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/zh/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/zh/</ext-link></collab></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Folkman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><article-title>Role of angiogenesis in tumor growth and metastasis</article-title><source>Semin Oncol</source><year>2002</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>15</fpage><lpage>18</lpage><comment>[PMID: 12516034]</comment>
