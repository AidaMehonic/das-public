In contrast to conventional detergents, APol are able to keep MP soluble even when the free APol concentration is very low. Outer membrane protein F (OmpF) is the most abundant MP commonly found in the outer membrane (OM) of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. It plays a vital role in the transport of hydrophilic nutrients, as well as antibiotics, across&#x000a0;the OM. In the present study, APol was used to solubilise OmpF to characterize its interactions with molecules such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or colicins. OmpF was reconstituted into APol by the removal of detergents using Bio-Beads followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to remove excess APol. OmpF/APol complexes were then analysed by SEC, dynamic light scattering&#x000a0;(DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM showed that in the absence of free APol&#x02013;OmpF associated as long filaments with a thickness of ~6&#x000a0;nm. This indicates that the OmpF trimers lie on their sides on the carbon EM grid and that they also favour side by side association. The formation of filaments requires APol and occurs very rapidly. Addition of LPS to OmpF/APol complexes impeded filament formation and the trimers form 2D sheets which mimic the OM. Consequently, free APol is undoubtedly required to maintain the homogeneity of OmpF in solutions, but &#x02018;minimum APol&#x02019; provides a new phase, which can allow weaker protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;lipid interactions characteristic of native membranes to take place and thus control 1D&#x02013;2D crystallisation.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>OmpF</kwd><kwd>Lipopolysaccharides</kwd><kwd>Amphipol</kwd><kwd>Transmission electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>Dynamic light scattering</kwd><kwd>SEC</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are gram-negative bacteria which are a normal but minor commensal in the human gut. Most <italic>E. coli</italic> strains are harmless to humans, however, some strains can cause food poisoning, meningitis, or septicaemia. Like all gram-negative bacteria, the cell envelope of <italic>E. coli</italic> is surrounded by two membranes. The additional, so called outer membrane (OM), is highly asymmetric, consisting of tightly-packed lipopolysaccharides (LPS) located in the outer leaflet and phospholipids located in the inner leaflet. This OM acts as a defensive barrier but is also extremely permeable as a result of a large number of channel-forming proteins associated with the OM (Rosenbusch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1974</xref>; Jaroslawski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>). The nonspecific channel-forming proteins in the OM are termed porins and are responsible for the influx of hydrophilic solutes and nutrients, as well as the excretion of waste products (Nakae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1976</xref>; Nikaido <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2003</xref>).Outer membrane protein F (OmpF) which is the major porin of <italic>E. coli</italic> OM is a trimeric protein, each monomer forming a 16-stranded &#x003b2;-barrel channel which allows the diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules of less than ~600&#x000a0;kDa through its channel across the hydrophobic OM (Cowan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1992</xref>). OmpF is also a receptor and a translocator of colicins, bacterial toxins produced by <italic>E. coli</italic> (Evans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1996</xref>; Cascales et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>). Therefore, OmpF is a potential target for the design of new antibiotics (Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>).</p><p>To study membrane proteins (MP) in vitro, they require detergents to stabilise them in aqueous solutions whilst remaining as native structures. It is often a demanding task to find suitable detergents to stabilise MPs outside their lipid bilayer environment. This partly explains why, relative to soluble proteins, so few high-resolution unique structures of MPs have been resolved (White <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>). To provide an alternative technology to overcome this problem, Popot and colleagues developed a novel class of detergent called <italic>Amphipol</italic> (APol), an amphipathic polymer comprising a hydrophilic backbone randomly grafted with hydrophobic chains. This structure enables APol to stabilise MP in detergent-free aqueous solutions (Tribet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1996</xref>; Popot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>). As APol forms multiple contacts with hydrophobic surface of MP, the rate of dissociation of APol from proteins is slow (Popot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2003</xref>). Theoretically, APol can solubilise MPs in a near absence of free APol (Tribet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1997</xref>; Popot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2003</xref>). Since its introduction almost 20&#x000a0;years ago, the reconstitution of MP into APol has become a promising approach to investigate the structure and function of MP. To date, structural studies on several MP stabilised by APol have been carried out using biophysical techniques such as electron microscopy (EM) (Tribet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1998</xref>; Fl&#x000f6;tenmeyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>; Gohon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>; Althoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>; Cvetkov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>; Cao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>; Liao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Zoonens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>; Catoire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>) and small-angle neutron scattering (Gohon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>).</p><p>However, although the multiple contacts of APol to MP ensure the high affinity of APol association, less is known about the importance of free APol to the long-term stability of MP Apol complexes. Unexpectedly, Zoonens et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>) reported that the removal of free APol gave rise to the association of MP/APol complexes from an initially homogenous state. Likewise, the preparation of bacteriorhodopsin/APol complexes using an approach which completely removed free APol, led to the self-organisation over months or years of bacteriorhodopsin/APol particles into long filaments. This worm-like structure observed by EM was constructed by linear association of monomeric particles (Gohon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report our observations of OmpF in complex with APol A8-35 in the absence of free APol. Initially, OmpF/APol complexes were prepared with the aim to study the interaction of the bacterial toxin Colicin N with OmpF (Clifton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). However, in the absence of APol, the OmpF/APol complexes had a tendency to form long filaments, similar to those observed by Gohon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>) for bacteriorhodopsin but much more rapidly. Consequently, we studied the structure and assembly kinetics of these filaments by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The effect of the OM specific lipopolysaccharide on the self-association of the OmpF/APol complexes was also examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Chemicals Specialist chemicals were purchased from the following suppliers octyl-polyoxyethylene (POE); Enzo, R<sub>a</sub>-Lipopolysaccharide (R<sub>a</sub>-LPS); Sigma Aldrich, BugBuster protein extraction reagent; Novagen, <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (DG); Anatrace, and <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<sc>d</sc>-maltoside; Melford.

These complexes were negatively stained and then studied by TEM. According to the published high-resolution structure of OmpF, illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b (Cowan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1992</xref>), OmpF forms a trimer with a height of approximately 6&#x000a0;nm and a maximum diameter of about 10&#x000a0;nm. Since the SEC elution profile revealed a homogeneous population of OmpF&#x02013;APol complexes marginally larger in diameter than detergent solubilised trimers, the negatively stained TEM images of OmpF/APol complexes were expected to reveal evenly dispersed single particles on the carbon film. Surprisingly, the electron micrographs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) demonstrated that OmpF/APol complexes formed long filaments with a characteristic width of ~6&#x000a0;nm. This width corresponds to the minimum dimension of OmpF, the height of the trimer, and suggests that they absorbed edge-on to the carbon film. Thus, the width of the filaments is rather constant, whereas, in contrast, the length of the long filaments is highly variable. The characteristic three pores which traverse the OmpF trimer show up as stain filled pits in negatively stained TEM images but were rarely seen within the filaments, thus supporting the suggestion that the hydrophobic edge of the filament preferentially absorbs onto the carbon film. OmpF without detergent forms large aggregates, so APol must still be present and involved in the filament structures which are stable in solution for at least a week with a complete absence of aggregates seen after centrifugation. Furthermore, filament formation by OmpF/APol complexes is reversed when adding free APol at 1:5 OmpF/APol weight ratio back to the same batch of OmpF/APol complexes containing filaments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>LPS Inhibits Self-Association of OmpF/APol Complexes</title><p>Conventionally expressed, in vivo folded, OmpF is purified from the OM of <italic>E. coli</italic> which contains tightly-packed LPS in the outer leaflet. OmpF extracted from this membrane often co-purifies with the significant amounts of tightly bound LPS. This OmpF&#x02013;LPS interaction is stable enough to be observed by SDS-PAGE analysis of native OmpF trimers and reveals a ladder pattern of LPS-bound OmpF bands (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) (Baboolal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>). The number of additional bands indicates the relative amount of LPS attached to the OmpF trimers. In the initial study, above, the samples had a low LPS content but were not conclusively LPS free. Since LPS molecules cross-link to adjacent LPS via divalent cations such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Schneck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>), the OmpF&#x02013;LPS interaction may promote lateral OmpF association. In order to clearly investigate the effect of LPS on the formation of filaments, LPS-free OmpF was produced by refolding OmpF from denatured inclusion bodies. In the present study, LPS-free OmpF, OmpF+LPS and OmpF+LPS in EDTA were reconstituted into APol, and the complexes were fractionated by SEC. We used &#x02018;rough&#x02019; Ra-LPS lacking the outer core and O-antigen to limit the interactions to the membrane region of OmpF and this was added to LPS-free OmpF at 1:5 OmpF/LPS molecular ratio prior to incubation with APol.

Furthermore, when OmpF+LPS/APol complexes were formed in, and eluted in SEC column buffer containing EDTA, the amount of aggregates significantly decreased leaving a mixture of OmpF/APol particles with various sizes.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Effect of lipopolysaccharides on the structure of OmpF/APol complexes. <bold>a</bold> SEC analysis of size and homogeneity of OmpF/APol complexes in various conditions.

Using LPS-free OmpF, the filaments of OmpF/APol still appeared in the absence of free APol (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). However, they clearly showed a beaded structure which probably corresponds to the repetitive pattern of OmpF trimers along the chain. OmpF/APol complexes in the presence of LPS assembled as sheet-like structures rather than filaments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e) and this led to small areas of apparent 2D crystallisation. In fact, the filament-like structure observed in samples of OmpF+LPS/APol were, in reality, folded sheets of OmpF. Once divalent cations were chelated by EDTA, a combination of small sheet-like and filamentous structure was observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). These results indicate that LPS disrupts the linear (1D) filaments of OmpF stabilised by APol and provokes a 2D behaviour reminiscent of the natural membrane and also in vitro crystals formed by OmpF&#x02013;Lipid mixtures (Hoenger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1993b</xref>; Schabert and Engel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1994</xref>; Baboolal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>). Thus, the OmpF/APol structure stabilises a unique interaction where a simple, side by side, linear association of trimers is preferred over all other forms. However, this stability is easily disrupted by LPS to form 2D sheets or by excess APol to form isolated complexes. In the presence of a carbon grid surface used for EM it appears that one membrane face of the linear filament, normally stabilised by APol, is adsorbed onto that surface. Thus, the APol&#x02013;OmpF filaments are marginally stable and highly dynamic such that they can be influenced by small changes in their environment. They may thus be useful starting points for crystallisation studies of OmpF complexes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Maturation of OmpF/APol Filaments</title><p>In the previous experiments, all complexes for TEM study were prepared the day before, and thus the rate of formation of OmpF/APol complexes was unknown. To measure the kinetics of OmpF/APol filament formation after the removal of free APol, the size distribution of LPS-free OmpF/APol complexes after SEC was monitored by DLS at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C as a function of time. The size distributions were analysed by intensity as this mode is more sensitive to large particles in the samples. The size of OmpF trimer in conventional detergents measured by DLS is approximately 10&#x000a0;nm (data not shown). DLS size distribution data of OmpF/APol complexes suggested that the number of particles with sizes above 10&#x000a0;nm increased over time while the number of single OmpF trimers/APol decreased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Even though we measured freshly prepared complexes, a small amount of large particles was already present after 15&#x000a0;min. Therefore, it is evident that self-association of OmpF in the absence of free APols occurred very rapidly.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Progression of filament formation by OmpF/APol complexes. <bold>a</bold> Size distribution of OmpF/APol complexes by intensity measured at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C by DLS from 15&#x000a0;min to 6&#x000a0;days after SEC. <bold>b</bold> Structural models of possible OmpF filaments showing &#x02018;top&#x02019; and &#x02018;side&#x02019; views.

The images of negatively stained complexes were recorded at different times after SEC. The TEM images of freshly prepared complexes 10&#x000a0;min after filament removal of APol by SEC revealed that there was the mixture of short and long filaments, as well as individual particles of OmpF trimers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, d). Groups of OmpF trimers starting to join up with the filaments can also be observed in these early samples. Interestingly, the top view of OmpF, with stain filled pores, can be occasionally seen only in freshly prepared samples, whereas this was very rarely seen with mature filaments in older samples. These measurements make it clear that single Apol stabilised OmpF trimers behave like OmpF/APol filaments in preferably attaching to the carbon film on their membrane interacting face. The 1-day-old filaments extended further after (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e) 1&#x000a0;week&#x02019;s total incubation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f). In accordance with these results, it can concluded that the filaments consist of OmpF trimers bound side by side and mostly seen on their side on the EM grid as in the model shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b with the long axis of the trimer arranged in line with the filament.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results reveal a hierarchy of OmpF self-association which has not been observed in conventional detergents. The SEC almost certainly removes all but directly bound APol from the OmpF trimer, and this is apparently a metastable state. Rather than forming large insoluble aggregates, which form a distinct pellet when centrifuged, the resulting structures are linear filaments of fixed width. The easiest way to imagine how such an array would form is by head to tail stacking of OmpF trimers, but this clearly cannot account for the 6&#x000a0;nm width which corresponds to the height of a trimer. The 10&#x000a0;nm diameter of the trimer most likely lies in the long axis of the filament, and this is supported by the higher resolution LPS-free filaments where a significant beading is observed with an approximate 10&#x000a0;nm repeat. Thus, we propose that the filaments are one dimensional arrays of OmpF linked by their normally membrane exposed surfaces, but why this does not progress to 2D arrays is not clear. Is there a point of specific strong interaction between trimers that overcomes the solubility afforded by APol or does filament formation release enough APol to satisfy the need to stabilise the filaments? The filaments would appear to pre-exist in solution but on contact with the reactive carbon film on the EM grid, preferentially adsorb with one hydrophobic membrane face downwards. Thus, the first step of stabilisation in minimal APol is specific self-association, and the second one we observe is the possible displacement of APol from one face of the filament via contact with the surface. Finally, the OmpF&#x02013;APol complexes reveal much about the role of LPS in OmpF association. It is known that LPS binds tightly and specifically to OmpF, but here it is shown to strongly favour the assembly of 2D crystals especially in the presence of calcium-induced cross-links. Our previous AFM experiments revealed limited ordered self-association of OmpF in octyl-POE (Cisneros et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>) but the use of APol has revealed a subtlety of interaction which was suppressed by the more conventional detergents. This lateral association into quasi-crystalline arrays has been seen in natural gram-negative OMs by both electron and atomic force microscopy (Hoenger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1993a</xref>; Jaroslawski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>). It suggests that reconstitution of weakly associated membrane complexes may be achieved by careful control of free APol levels.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a Royal Thai Government Scholarship to WA and the Wellcome Trust (Grant number 093581).
