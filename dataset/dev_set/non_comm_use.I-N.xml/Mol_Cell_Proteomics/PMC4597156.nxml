Here, we describe an industrialized platform to generate antigens and validated recombinant antibodies for 346 transcription factors (TFs) and 211 epigenetic antigens. We describe an optimized automated phage display and antigen expression pipeline that in aggregate produced about 3000 sequenced Fragment antigen-binding domain that had high affinity (typically EC<sub>50</sub>&#x0003c;20 n<sc>m</sc>), high stability (T<sub>m</sub>&#x0223c;80 &#x000b0;C), good expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> (&#x0223c;5 mg/L), and ability to bind antigen in complex cell lysates. We evaluated a subset of Fabs generated to homologous SCAN domains for binding specificities. These Fragment antigen-binding domains were monospecific to their target SCAN antigen except in rare cases where they cross-reacted with a few highly related antigens. Remarkably, immunofluorescence experiments in six cell lines for 270 of the TF antigens, each having multiple antibodies, show that &#x0223c;70% stain predominantly in the cytosol and &#x0223c;20% stain in the nucleus which reinforces the dominant role that translocation plays in TF biology. These cloned antibody reagents are being made available to the academic community through our web site recombinant-antibodies.org to allow a more system-wide analysis of TF and chromatin biology. We believe these platforms, infrastructure, and automated approaches will facilitate the next generation of renewable antibody reagents to the human proteome in the coming decade.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health

However, reproducibility for antibody reagents is a major concern, especially for polyclonals and even monoclonals where genetic drift of hybridoma stocks can be problematic (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Moreover, some have estimated that less than half of the animal derived antibodies bind their cognate native proteins (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The systematic generation of recombinant antibodies would provide a renewable collection of cloned and highly validated antibody genes and a permanent validation database (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Recombinant antibodies also afford a biosynthetic tool kit for recombination and gene fusions to generate new sensors and functional modulators. Other efforts for renewable antibody reagents (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) have highlighted the need to design robotics and high-throughput platforms for antigen production, antibody selections, and characterization (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>One area of need for renewable antibody reagents are proteins involved in chromatin biology including transcription factors (TFs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="G1"><sup>1</sup></xref> and epigenetic antigens. According to The Human Protein Atlas (HPA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>), there are commercially available antibodies to 362 of the estimated 1550 human TFs (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and none are from recombinant sources (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.antibodypedia.org">www.antibodypedia.org</ext-link>). Thus, the absence of validated recombinant antibodies to profile specific TF interactions and their spatial distribution is needed. As a protein class, TFs have been particularly challenging because they contain multiple domains, often intrinsically disordered (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and thus difficult to express as full-length proteins. Hence the NIH Common Fund funded this broad effort to generate renewable antibody reagents to this class of proteins (1U54HG006436). Such antibodies would be an important resource for biologists interested in understanding trafficking of TFs, their expression patterns in cells at the protein level, and ultimately their binding sites and partners during signaling.</p><p>Recombinant technologies for antigen production and antibody selections are poised for a large-scale effort to generate renewable antibodies to chromatin remodeling proteins. Recombinant antibody generation by phage display is not dependent on animal immunizations where control of the target protein is relinquished to the animal's immune system. Maintaining control of the protein status <italic>in vitro</italic> allows the user to customize selection conditions such as buffer, pH, temperature, and competitor proteins. <italic>In vitro</italic> methods eliminate antigen proteolysis, clearance, and auto-antigen antiselection in an animal setting (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These bench-scale technologies are well-honed but we believe that by automating the <italic>in vitro</italic> selection technologies can fully realize their additional advantages of reducing the processing time from months to weeks, with much less antigen and reduced cost.</p><p>Here we present an industrialized platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref><italic>B</italic>) for generating high affinity renewable antibodies at large scale that is exemplified here for TFs and epigenetic factors, 557 total chromatin remodeling targets. Soluble domains of TFs were expressed in multiple high-throughput expression formats to ensure a soluble and intact antigen at a sufficient quantity for antibody selections (&#x0003c;1 mg). We utilized a highly stable and diverse synthetic Fab scaffold, displayed on filamentous phage (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Robotic platforms were designed to rapidly select and characterize multiple Fabs of high affinity, specificity, stability, and expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> for each of 346 human TFs (representing &#x0003e;18 protein domain folds) and 211 different epigenetic proteins. Remarkably, immunofluorescence with multiple antibodies per TF in six different cell lines showed that about two thirds of human transcription factors tested reside predominantly in the cytosol, but the precise distribution is cell-line dependent. These data highlight the importance of translocation in TF biology. Our studies describe the pitfalls and viable solutions for a high-throughput platform that we believe will greatly accelerate the process of producing renewable, high quality, and evolvable antibody reagents to folded proteins. These cloned antibodies are available to the academic community for research purposes through the recombinant-antibodies.org.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Antigen Sources</title><p>An NIH funded project was launched to rapidly develop and implement a high-throughput pipeline designed to generate high quality renewable recombinant antibodies to human transcription factors (U54 HG006436). TF antigens reported here were generated by Rutgers University, epigenetic antigens generated by the Structural Genomics Consortium (SCG), and in-house at the RAN facilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial Strains</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strain XL1-blue (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) or T1 phage resistant cells were used for phage propagation, whereas strains DH10B (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), or other T1 phage resistant cells were used for Fab expression C43 (DE3) Pro+ (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) or BL21 (DE3) were used. XL1-blue or T1 phage resistant cells were grown in the presence of 5 &#x003bc;g/ml tetracycline (Tet) to ensure expression of the F&#x02018; pilus that allowed for phage infection and DH10B cells were grown with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml carbenicillin (Carb) for production of plasmid DNA. Fab expression cells, C43 (DE3) Pro+, were grown with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml Carb and 25 &#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin (Kan). Where biotinylation was required (Antigen or Fab) recombinant BirA co-expressed or added during purification (Avidity, LLC., Aurora, CO).</p></sec><sec><title>Antigen Cloning and Expression</title><p>The genes for transcription factor domains were identified by bioinformatics (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and synthesized (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and were provided as <italic>E. coli</italic> expression constructs. In order to generate constructs for antigen expression by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and translation (IVTT), and <italic>E. coli</italic>, gene fragments were PCR amplified from transfer plasmids and recombined into their specific expression vectors by SLICE or Ligase Independent Cloning techniques (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). All expression plasmids were sequence verified prior to expression studies.</p><p>The antigen production group at Rutgers University or at the SGC Consortium provided purified human biotinylated human transcription factor domains or chromatin remodeling antigens as N-terminal tagged AviTag fusions. For Rutgers antigens, expression constructs were synthesized (GenScript Inc., Piscataway, NJ), cloned into an expression vector containing an N-terminal AviTag, HisTag, and TEV cleavage site, and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> Tuner (DE3) harboring a pLysSRARE2 helper plasmid (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Cells were harvested, lysed by sonication, and clarified lysate was loaded onto HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) columns for purification. If the protein of interest was predominantly found in inclusion bodies, pellets were lysed in solubilization buffer (binding buffer containing 6 <sc>m</sc> urea), bound to the HisTrap column, and subjected to a slow refolding gradient into binding buffer without urea prior to elution. Pooled elution fractions were <italic>in vitro</italic> biotinylated (Avidity LLC), concentrated, and applied to a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75pg (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) column to remove unreacted biotin and ATP. Fractions corresponding to the monomeric peak were pooled and concentrated before being snap frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until shipment (Campbell, E. Anderson, S. in preparation). SGC produced antigens were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified by Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography, and tested for biotinylation prior to entry into the Fab selection pipeline (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Protein expression system comparisons consisted of base-line TF expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> as intracellular GST fusion constructs (His-GST-Avi-TEV-Antigen) driven from the pTac promoter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/O115.052209/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>C</italic></ext-link>). <italic>E. coli</italic> based <italic>e</italic>xpression of soluble GST-TF fusion antigens was conducted by standard protein expression methods. Briefly <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures were grown in Terrific Broth with antibiotics to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6&#x02013;0.8 with 1 m<sc>m</sc> IPTG for 3&#x02013;6 h at 37&#x000b0;C, then harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended, lysed by sonication, and clarified prior to purification with GST Sepharose (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). As a second system we expressed the TFs as His-Avi-TEV N-terminal fusion driven from a T7 promoter using an <italic>E. coli in vitro</italic> transcription-translation system (IVTT) that was kindly provided by Sutro Biosciences (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/O115.052209/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>D</italic></ext-link>). The cell-free reaction mixture contained an ATP regeneration system supplemented with chaperones and redox enzymes. Briefly, 10 &#x003bc;g of IVTT plasmid constructs were combined with 1 ml cell free extract containing recombinant BirA protein and 50 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> biotin and allowed to shake at 650rpm for 2 h in an Eppendorf Thermomixer Expressed and biotinylated protein was purified over NiNTA agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with PBS based buffer system and eluted with PBS + 400 m<sc>m</sc> Imidazole. Protein samples were buffer exchanged with Amicon spin concentrators (EMD Millipore), concentrations determined by Bradford BSA assay (Thermo Fisher, Grand Island, NY), and analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE prior to entering the selection pipeline (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In the third system, we displayed the antigen for selection on the surface of yeast (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). To generate constructs for YAD, gene fragments were PCR amplified from gene synthesis transfer plasmids and then recombined into YAD plasmid. YAD constructs utilized a N-terminal Avi-6xHis-Aga2-TEV protease fusion partner with a C-terminal V5-His tag. The YAD strain, EBY100, was engineered to overexpress agglutinin AGA1 under the galactose inducible Gal1&#x02013;10 promoter, which formed a disulfide bonds with the antigen-Aga2 protein in the extracellular space. Constructs were biotinylated during secretion by a cytoplasmic or ER localized BirA, which allowed for efficient capture to streptavidin magnetic beads (Promega, Madison, WI) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The TF domain was expressed with a C-terminal V5 epitope tag to monitor expression level (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/O115.052209/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>E</italic> and S4</ext-link>). The proteins generated from these three systems were then tested for the ability to generate antibodies by phage display.</p></sec><sec><title>Fab-phage Selections</title><p>All phage selections were done according to previously established protocols (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) with several modifications as outlined below. Briefly, Fab-phage selections were automated allowing for multi-parallel processing of biotinylated target antigens either generated in-house or obtained from collaborators. Up to four rounds of soluble phage selections were conducted with biotinylated target antigens bound to streptavidin magnetic beads (Promega). The antigen concentration on the bead was systematically decreased with successive selection round as follows: 100 n<sc>m</sc> Round 1, 50 n<sc>m</sc> Round 2, 10 n<sc>m</sc> Rounds 3 and 4. To maximize throughput and reduce the amount of phage library used, up to 8 antigen-streptavidin beads complexes were combined into one selection well for round 1. Antigen-streptavidin beads were incubated with 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>13</sup> Fab-phage particles from either Library E or F for one hour with gentle mixing on a King Fisher Flex magnetic bead separator (Thermo Scientific) followed by three washes in phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (PBST+BSA). To reduce the deleterious effects of nonspecific binding phage, we employed a &#x0201c;catch and release&#x0201d; strategy, where specific antigen binding Fab-phage were selectively eluted from the magnetic beads by the addition of 2 &#x003bc;g/well TEV Protease for 10 min. Once liberated from the streptavidin beads, Fab-phage were introduced to 5 ml (Selection Round 1) or 100 &#x003bc;l (Selection Rounds 2&#x02013;4) of exponentially growing <italic>E. coli</italic> XL1-Blue or T1 phage resistant cells and propagated overnight at 37 &#x000b0;C with shaking.</p><p>Once propagated, Fab-phage were recovered from culture medium with Protein A magnetic beads (EMD Millipore) on the King Fisher Flex. Briefly, 20&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;l of a Protein A magnetic bead slurry was incubated with up to 1 ml culture supernatant for 60 min then beads were collected and washed prior to elution of Fab-phage with 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> Acetic acid for 10 min. Tris-base pH 11 buffer was added to neutralize the purified Fab-phage prior to further processing. The initial Fab-phage library and amplified eluents can contain a small subpopulation of streptavidin binding Fab-phage, therefore prior to each selection round Fab-phage pools were incubated with 50 &#x003bc;l streptavidin-beads for 10 min then the beads were removed with the King Fisher Flex to deplete the library of any nonspecific binding Fab-phage.

Unlike standard elution by low pH glycine elution from bare plastic plates (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), the proteolytic catch and release format ensures clean and efficient recovery of antigen bound Fab-phage regardless of antigen affinity. The catch and release approach, which is highly amenable to automation, reduces the recovery of nonspecific phage bound to the streptavidin bead or otherwise absorbed or aggregated onto the surface.</p><p>Several other improvements were made to the standard Fab-phage protocols. We found it useful to enrich phage particles that display functional Fab-phage with Protein A magnetic beads because only about 10% of phagemid have a Fab displayed. In addition, we exposed the phage to streptavidin magnetic beads to reduce the number of nonspecific or avidin binding Fab-phage. Lastly, the stringency of the selection was increased each round by systematically lowering the antigen concentration from 100 n<sc>m</sc> to 10 n<sc>m</sc>. From experience with hundreds of antigen selections, we found that &#x0223c;1nmol of antigen is needed for the selection process (&#x0223c;25 &#x003bc;g for a 25 kDa antigen). This is considerably below what is typically used for animal immunizations.

We measured the OD<sub>650</sub>/min for direct binding of the Fab-phage to biotinylated antigen bound to a neutravidin or streptavidin coated ELISA plate (or an antigen coated ELISA plate) that was then probed with an anti-M13 phage antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>, <italic>y</italic>-axis). This high throughput assay provided a composite estimate of functional Fab-phage affinity and expression. We estimated the relative affinity by a single point Fab-phage competition binding ELISA. Here the Fab-phage were mixed with 20 n<sc>m</sc> soluble antigen and then allowed to bind to the same antigen plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>, <italic>x</italic>-axis) where OD<sub>650</sub>/min was monitored and used to calculate a competition ratio. Competition ratio is defined as the OD<sub>650</sub>/min of competitive binding divided by the OD<sub>650</sub>/min of direct binding signal. Fab-phage clones were considered to have passed when they were shown to have expressed at OD<sub>650</sub> &#x0003e;0.005 (or OD<sub>450</sub> &#x0003e;0.1) and were competed by soluble antigen ratio &#x0003c;0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>, upper left green quadrant).

This simple ELISA triage step for 96 Fab-Phage generally requires less than 1nmol of antigen. The most promising clones (typically &#x0223c;48) were picked and prepared for DNA sequencing. Fab sequences are aligned and unique representative clones chosen for subsequent isolation, expression, and purification.</p><p>For expression of soluble monovalent Fab fragments, the Fab-phage clones were PCR amplified and subcloned into standardized <italic>E. coli</italic> expression plasmids, either Avi- or non-Avi-tagged (recombinant-antibodies.org/protocols), by SLICE or Ligase independent cloning methods (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Sequence verified plasmids were then transformed into C43 Pro+ <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) for expression studies. Expressed Fabs were purified by semi-automated Protein A chromatography that typically recovered 100&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;g purified Fab proteins.

high affinity Fab that passed the primary and secondary validation depended on TF domain type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">Table I</xref>). For example, antibody selections for SCAN domains succeeded 88% of the time, whereas Zinc finger domains were only successful 26% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). It is possible these differences reflect the stability of the domains or that antigens form complexes with a molecule in the lysate (<italic>e.g.</italic> DNA) in such a way that prevents Fab binding.</p><p>We also tested a subset of Fabs (<italic>n</italic> = 18) that were generated to SCAN domain-containing antigens in a single point pairwise ELISA analysis to address specificity of the Fabs to the different SCAN domains of varying homology. In almost all cases the Fabs generated here mono-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>left</italic> panel). In the few cases where the Fab was poly-specific, for example RAB-S181, S145, and S169, the target antigens were &#x0003e;93% identical and only differed in amino acid composition by up to 5 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>right</italic> panel). This degree of selectivity was remarkable given we did not impose a counter selection against the closely related antigen. We also tested a Fab that failed the Spiked-IP assay as a negative control and this indeed showed a higher degree of poly-specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>left</italic> panel).</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Assessment of the specificity of anti-SCAN domain Fabs.</bold> Left panel shows specificity heatmap of 18 Fabs tested against 17 closely related SCAN domains using the direct ELISA method.

We also find that the number of Fabs identified per antigen systematically decreases as the isoelectric point (pI) of the antigen increased from pI 4 to 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>).

Some antigens produced many passing antibodies (&#x0003e;45 Fabs per 96 tested) and others produced only a few. We conclude that having multiple antigen formats increases the likelihood of successful selection by providing back-up systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence Validation of Fabs and Location of Antigens in the Cell</title><p>Transcription factors can reside in almost any compartment in the cell from the cell membrane, to cytosol to nucleus (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Having an unprecedented collection of renewable antibodies to TFs allows us to begin to probe the cellular distribution of these TFs by immunofluorescence (IF). We chose six human cell lines that are known to express detectable levels of mRNA based on RNA sequence data (not shown) for each of 270 TFs which we had multiple passing Fabs. We used a high-throughput IF assay to screen 1017 Fabs in permeabilized cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/O115.052209/DC1">supplemental Table S3</ext-link>). Columbus software associated with an Opera imager (Perkin Elmer) was utilized to quantify the fluorescence intensities across multiple fields for each antibody to generate a heat map showing a ratio of nuclear intensity to cytoplasmic intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). Staining patterns were also scored by visual inspection using four standard GO-based descriptors typically applied to categorize cellular localization: cytoplasmic, nuclear, mixed cytoplasmic/nuclear, and miscellaneous. Interestingly, TF proteins appear to have different localization patterns depending on cell type and growth conditions. These results suggest that the Fabs produced here were specific for their target TF and could be used to monitor TF trafficking. Examples of each of these categories are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>. When analyzing the binding patterns of all Fabs tested by IF, we found that on average &#x0223c;70% of the Fabs tested localized predominantly to the cytosol and &#x0223c;20% to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>). There was remarkable consistency between these two scoring methods and across all cell lines in terms of the proportion in the nucleus <italic>versus</italic> cytosol (20% <italic>versus</italic> 70%). Moreover, some TFs were found in different locations depending on the cell type likely reflecting their activation state differences. We also compared our IF data with those in common from the Protein Atlas, which generated affinity purified polyclonal antibodies against segments of TFs. Remarkably, we found that of the 55 antigens where an overlapping antibody has been developed, 50 (90.1%) show identical localization patterns (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/O115.052209/DC1">supplemental Table S5</ext-link>).</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Photomicrographs and heat map showing Immunofluorescence staining patterns (cytosol in blue to nuclear in red) for 1017 Fabs directed to 270 TFs.</bold>

Similar to the TFs, these chromatin-remodeling proteins are large multi-domain molecules that are difficult to express and are prone to aggregation in their full-length forms. Thus, as was the case for the TFs, the design of the antigens was based on identifying domain types that could be expressed as independent and stable entities. In many cases we had direct structural information to guide the domain expression experiments. From the phage display selections against 211 antigens we obtained 334 Fabs that passed primary affinity, and secondary Spiked-IP or IP-MS validation. Marcon and co-workers (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), developed an IP-MS method and tested 1154 Fabs to 154 of the epigenetic antigens for binding their endogenous target in HEK293 cells. They found that 452 of these antibodies pulled down the endogenous target for 98 antigens where the antigen (and in some cases known binding partners) were among the top three proteins identified. The other 54 targets were presumed not expressed at high enough endogenous levels to detect. This success rate from primary to secondary validation was roughly the same as the Spiked-IP method. Although the IP-MS assay is more labor intensive than Spiked-IP, it provides direct mass data for antigen capture in the presence of complex cellular lysate like the Spiked-IP assay. The overall success rate for antigens producing primary and secondary passing Fabs was 68% (123 out of 200 tested). The generally higher success rate for the epigenetic targets was probably because of the fact that the expressed domains benefited from knowledge of the actual structures of many of the domains, which had been determined previously in the SGC.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>There is a recognized need for creating tool antibodies to the entire human proteome (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The first systematic effort to generate proteome-wide antibody reagents began with the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) over a decade ago focused on generating polyclonal antibodies in rabbits (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). To increase antigenicity, antigens were produced to 100-residue segments, called protein epitope signature tags (PrEST). PrESTs were chosen from the human target predominantly to be highly non-homologous to the rabbit homolog and without consideration of domain structure or fold. This large-scale effort generated affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies that reportedly react with PrESTs to over 80% of expressed human genes. Validation data is publically available through the HPA web site (proteinatlas.org). Many of these antibodies are now available through commercial vendors, but not yet for open source distribution given the expense of production. In comparing our IF data to those in the Protein Atlas we found 55 targets in common for staining the same cells. Remarkably, 50 of the 55 targets had the same staining patterns despite the one being a polyclonal and the other a recombinant monoclonal as well them having been raised to different regions of the common transcription factor. Polyclonal antibodies can have advantages over monoclonal antibodies because they can bind many epitopes thus ensuring greater probability of reacting with proteins in various formats. However the antibody epitopes and binding mechanisms are challenging to assess, as they are mixtures. Animal derived polyclonal antibodies suffer from the fact that they are not renewable and thus expensive validation data and production yields are lot dependent. Moreover, the human antigen can lead to self-selection against conserved proteins or epitopes an animal host and thus can preclude identification of functionally relevant epitopes (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).</p><p>Recombinant antibodies offer a renewable and stable source in the cloned monoclonal gene and hence there has been a call from the community to generate them systematically (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). The fact that selections can be run <italic>in vitro</italic> avoids problems with self-selection in the animal and can allow for isolation of very high-resolution antibody reagents ensured to bind the native protein and even specific conformations or post-translationally modified forms (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref><xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Moreover, cloned genes can be further manipulated as genetic tools and plasmids are easily made publically available to researchers at low cost. Our intent here was to develop an industrialized platform empowered by robotics for the high-throughput production of renewable recombinant antibodies using phage display and high throughput antigen production. We show this in generating multiple high affinity, well expressed, and cell reactive antibodies to 346 transcription factors and 211 epigenetic proteins.</p><p>Production of high quality antigens is a key step in the process because denatured or unstable proteins typically do not reliably yield good monoclonal antibodies to native proteins (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We focused on expression of what we considered to be stable domains (10&#x02013;20 kDa) based on bioinformatics analysis. It is well-known in the x-ray crystallography community that one often needs to try different constructs in different hosts to generate high purity and stable protein for crystallography (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Thus, we investigated three high throughput protein expression platforms to supplement the antigen pipeline. Indeed, there was considerable variability in success in generation of validated antibodies from the same antigen produced in these formats. We suspect the differences in selection success are because of antigen stability and solubility from the different formats as has been noted by McCafferty and coworkers (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). These different expression formats provide alternative pathways for generating antibodies to recalcitrant antigens.</p><p>The success rate for generating antibodies varied from 20&#x02013;100% depending on the fold-type of the TF. These differences may reflect the relative stabilities of these TF domains. Indeed, it was noted that zinc finger domains were particularly problematic to express and purify and they were typically the least successful in generating validated Fabs. There is also a systematic correlation to molecular weight and charge. For example, small domains generated fewer passing Fabs. This may reflect the smaller surface area and hence fewer epitopes, or that they are intrinsically less stable. Also, highly basic proteins with pIs above 8 to 9 are generally less successful than those with pI values between 4 and 7. This is possibly because of nonspecific interactions with the anionic phage coat precluding selection of specific binders. These trends help us predict which antigens might require more attention in order to produce high quality binders. Currently we have expressed 557 TFs, and 435 yielded about 3000 primary validated antibodies (based on unique sequence, affinity, stability, expressibility). Of the Fabs tested by Spiked-IP, 56% have passed. We suspect that the higher success rate for epigenetic antigens (68% of input) is because the antigens were chosen based on more accurate structural information.</p><p>Laboratory automation was critical to standardize the many routine and laborious activities ranging from phage sorting, ELISA, colony picking, PCR and stability measurements to facilitate large-scale generation of affinity reagents. The automated selection process greatly reduced the time from months in animals to weeks on the robot with reduced costs associated with antibody generation, and increased the throughput to up to 48 per batch of antibody selections. To take maximal advantage of the robotics it was necessary to make numerous adjustments in the bench scale phage and antigen protocols. For example, the automated magnetic bead selections coupled with the catch and release approach permitted clean elution of antigen-bound phage of very high affinity that can be problematic for low pH glycine elution. Moreover, protocols for preclearing the starting library and enriching selection pools for functional phage using Protein A purification have been added.</p><p>We attribute much of the success here to choosing a remarkably stable Fab library scaffold (average T<sub>m</sub> 80 &#x000b0;C). The selected Fabs show consistently high expression by simple shake flask culturing in <italic>E. coli</italic>. They are easily purified in high-throughput using simple Protein A columns. This synthetic library built on a highly stable and well-expressed scaffold can provide more consistent stability and expression than for natural B-cell derived libraries (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), which have multiple scaffolds that vary widely in stability and recombinant expression.</p><p>The selected Fabs had EC<sub>50</sub> values that ranged from high p<sc>m</sc> to 50 n<sc>m</sc> (average 20 n<sc>m</sc>) without additional affinity maturation. Moreover, these are readily converted to a Mab format that routinely affords a 10&#x02013;50-fold boost in affinity because of avidity and can be expressed in HEK293 cells at levels comparable to those in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Sachdev Sidhu <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results).</p><p>The Fabs typically showed good evidence for specificity in cell extracts by IP-MS (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) or here by Spiked-IP. Although the latter assay and others like it (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) do not directly identify possible off-targets, these are quite stringent for removing antibodies that react with non- or poly-specificity. Fabs generated to highly homologous SCAN domains showed high mono-specificity. In cases where cross-reactivity was observed this was to highly related domains, typically having homology between 80&#x02013;90%. This is remarkable in that we did not employ counter selections against the closest homologs and nor did we affinity mature the antibodies to increase selectivity. Such measures could be employed with these recombinant antibodies should cross-reactivity be observed.</p><p>TFs are extremely important players in biology. We have tested 1017 Fabs for their ability to bind 270 TFs in six different human cell lines. Remarkably, an average of 70% the Fabs recognized their target antigen predominantly in the cytosol and only about 20% in the nucleus. These data are similar to data presented at the HPA where a low percentage of TF antibodies bind only in the nucleus. Although we found the average distribution of TFs in the cytosol and nucleus were similar across the six cell lines, the TFs often were found in different compartments in different cells. The IF staining pattern represents a different bar code for each cell line and we believe this reflects differences in activation states in different cells. Our studies reinforce many individual studies showing that TFs transit from the cytosol to the nucleus upon activation. We believe these reagents will be very useful for systems-wide studies to study how TF activation affects transport as well as other important studies.</p><p>The recombinant antibodies have characteristics of highly selective binding reagents based on the high throughput validation data presented: stringent selection by phage display, unique sequences for each Fab, high stability and affinity, high and soluble expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, competitive binding with antigen, binding in the presence of complex cell lysates, and specific immunofluorescence binding patterns in cells. Although no systematic analysis of the suitability of the antibodies for Western blotting has been done, we do not anticipate high performance because the Fabs were intentionally raised to soluble protein domains. Nonetheless, for about 20 Fabs tested with collaborators, five showed a Western positive band corresponding to the TF suggesting a subset will work in Western blots (Gordon Whiteley, National Cancer Institute, unpublished results).</p><p>We have not systematically tested the performance of these antibodies in Chromatin immunopreciptitation (ChIP-Seq) experiments because of cost, but selective examples have been tested by Marcon and coworkers (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Clearly much more validation is warranted for these and many other applications including their use for structural studies. Nearly 1000 of the genes and expression constructs for these Fabs are currently available to academic researchers along with validation data through the Recombinant Antibody Network (recombinant-antibodies.org) and the plasmid repository at DNASU (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tinyurl.com/lm69t3s">http://tinyurl.com/lm69t3s</ext-link>). More will be made available as they transit the pipeline. Although we have only scratched the surface, an industrial-scale platform is in place for the generation of renewable antibodies to the entire proteome.</p></sec>
