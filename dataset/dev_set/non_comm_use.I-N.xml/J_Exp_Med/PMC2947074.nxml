Functional competence requires engagement of a self&#x02013;major histocompatability complex (MHC) class I&#x02013;specific inhibitory receptor, a process referred to as &#x0201c;licensing.&#x0201d; We previously suggested that licensing is developmentally determined in the bone marrow. In this study, we find that unlicensed mature MHC class I&#x02013;deficient splenic NK cells show gain-of-function and acquire a licensed phenotype after adoptive transfer into wild-type (WT) hosts. Transferred NK cells produce WT levels of interferon-&#x003b3; after engagement of multiple activation receptors, and degranulate at levels equivalent to WT NK cells upon coincubation with target cells. Only NK cells expressing an inhibitory Ly49 receptor specific for a cognate host MHC class I molecule show this gain-of-function. Therefore, these findings, which may be relevant to clinical bone marrow transplantation, suggest that neither exposure to MHC class I ligands during NK development in the BM nor endogenous MHC class I expression by NK cells themselves is absolutely required for licensing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>NK cells are innate immune lymphocytes with potent effector functions against infected and tumor cells. NK cells integrate signals received through target cell ligand-mediated engagement of activation receptors with those from inhibitory receptor engagement by MHC class I ligands expressed on targets. Absence of MHC class I on target cells often leads to NK cell activation. This phenomenon, termed &#x0201c;missing-self,&#x0201d; allows NK cells to attack and eliminate cells with aberrantly low or absent expression of MHC class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">K&#x000e4;rre et al., 1986</xref>), as with transformed or virally infected cells. Hence, NK cells use inhibitory receptors to assess the surface of self-tissues for MHC class I expression, providing a line of defense against pathogens and abnormal cell growth.</p><p>MHC class I molecules are also crucial to acquisition of effector function by NK cells in vivo as NK cells from MHC class I&#x02013;deficient hosts are defective in natural killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bix et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">H&#x000f6;glund et al., 1991</xref>) and hyporesponsive to triggering through their activation receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Recent data obtained in MHC-sufficient hosts support the hypothesis that cognate interaction between inhibitory receptors and self-MHC is necessary for acquisition of effector function. For example, Ly49C<sup>+</sup> NK cells, which bind a self-MHC I ligand (H2K<sup>b</sup>) in the H2<sup>b</sup> haplotype of C57BL/6 mice, display more robust production of cytokines upon stimulation than NK cells expressing only Ly49A, which has no H2<sup>b</sup> ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). This is most evident in a C57BL/6 transgenic (Tg) mouse expressing a single-chain trimer H2K<sup>b</sup> (SCT-K<sup>b</sup>) molecule, consisting of the H2K<sup>b</sup> heavy chain covalently linked to &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m) and the SIINFEKL peptide from ovalbumin. In mice where SCT-K<sup>b</sup> is the only MHC class I molecule expressed, i.e., SCT-K<sup>b</sup> Tg mouse on the K<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (triple KO; TKO) background, and Ly49C is the sole NK cell receptor capable of binding the SCT-K<sup>b</sup> molecule, only Ly49C<sup>+</sup> NK cells display the licensed phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, engagement of self&#x02013;MHC-specific receptor &#x0201c;licenses&#x0201d; NK cells to be functionally competent to be triggered through their activation receptors.</p><p>Although there has been debate on the meaning of the term &#x0201c;licensing,&#x0201d; most groups now agree that the engagement of inhibitory receptors by self&#x02013;MHC class I results in education of NK cells to become functionally competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anfossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Raulet and Vance, 2006</xref>). Moreover, such education effects have also been observed with human NK cells via self-HLA recognition by killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), which are related by convergent evolution to murine Ly49 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kelley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anfossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, self&#x02013;MHC class I engagement by NK cell inhibitory receptors appears to be a fundamental element in acquisition of NK cell effector function.</p><p>Conventional murine NK cells are thought to develop primarily, if not completely, in the BM where they progress through a series of stages en route to full maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Santo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). After this process, they leave the BM and populate the peripheral tissues. Egress from the BM is generally accepted as a marker of mature conventional NK cells, as cells isolated from peripheral lymphoid tissues demonstrate effector function upon stimulation. We previously hypothesized licensing to be a developmental process because Ly49 receptors are first expressed at an immature stage during NK cell maturation in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). Thereafter, developing NK cells undergo constitutive proliferation that appears to be influenced by MHC class I and the relevant Ly49 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is not known if licensing can occur outside the context of development within the BM, or whether the unlicensed phenotype is fixed.</p><p>Herein, we performed adoptive transfer of peripheral, hyporesponsive NK cells from MHC class I&#x02013;deficient donors to MHC class I&#x02013;sufficient hosts, resulting in the generation of functional donor NK cells. Expression of a host MHC class I ligand specific for a donor cell inhibitory NK cell receptor was necessary for the observed gain of function, which is highly suggestive of licensing as a mechanism. We conclude that the unlicensed phenotype is not fixed in apparently mature peripheral NK cells, and that licensing may not be exclusively a developmental process in the BM.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>MHC class I&#x02013;deficient NK cells gain function after transfer to MHC I-sufficient hosts</title><p>To examine potential for gain of function by hyporesponsive, peripheral MHC class I&#x02013;deficient NK cells, we harvested and labeled &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes with CFSE and injected them into MHC class I&#x02013;sufficient WT (C57BL/6) or control &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts. At day 7, host spleens were harvested and bulk splenocytes were activated in vitro by anti-NK1.1 cross-linking, and then analyzed for intracellular IFN-&#x003b3;. Surprisingly, we found that donor-derived MHC class I&#x02013;deficient &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells in WT hosts produced IFN-&#x003b3; at a level equivalent to that of host WT NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In contrast, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donor cells in &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts produced IFN-&#x003b3; at a frequency identical to host-derived &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This was equivalent to the hyporesponsive production of IFN-&#x003b3; by NK cells from unmanipulated &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> control animals (unpublished data). Therefore, adoptive transfer of hyporesponsive splenic NK cells appeared to result in the acquisition of activation receptor responses that correlated with host NK cell responsiveness.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Ly49C<sup>+</sup> MHC class I&#x02013;deficient NK cells gain function after transfer to WT hosts.</bold> Splenocytes were purified from &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donors, labeled with CSFE, and adoptively transferred i.v. into WT (C57BL/6) or &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts.

However, transfer of a sufficiently large number of cells can result in BM graft acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cudkowicz and Bennett, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koh et al., 2005</xref>), and we suspect the same process may be occurring here. Regardless, host NK cells did not demonstrate increased responsiveness as compared with NK cells from unmanipulated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and did not display markers associated with activation (not depicted). Thus, we found no evidence for host NK cell activation that may have accounted for the phenotypic change in the donor NK cells.</p><p>It was possible that the gain of function observed for transferred MHC class I&#x02013;deficient cells could be caused by their coincubation with WT splenocytes during in vitro stimulation. To test this possibility, we mixed freshly isolated &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT splenocytes at various ratios and stimulated them under the conditions used for the analyses of adoptively transferred cells. Regardless of the presence of WT cells in co-culture, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells retained their hyporesponsive phenotype after receptor cross-linking (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20100986/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). These results indicate that the gain of function of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells after adoptive transfer to WT hosts is imparted during residence in the MHC class I&#x02013;sufficient environment, not during co-culture and stimulation.</p><p>As we and others have recently shown that previously activated NK cells exhibit a memory-like property of enhanced cytokine production upon restimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sun et al., 2009</xref>), we sought to determine if our current results could reflect prior donor NK cell activation. Although kinetic studies revealed that donor NK cells gained function at WT levels by day 4 after transfer and that their phenotype was stable thereafter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20100986/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>), donor &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells did not spontaneously produce IFN-&#x003b3; or display markers of activation, such as CD69, at any time (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20100986/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link> and not depicted). Prior studies also showed that previously activated NK cells displaying the memory-like phenotype preferentially proliferate upon transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, donor &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells did not proliferate after residence in WT hosts, as indicated by a lack of CFSE dilution (Fig. S3 A). Collectively, these data indicate that &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells were not activated after adoptive transfer to WT hosts, suggesting that acquisition of functional competence is unrelated to a memory-like phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Gain of function is restricted to cells expressing inhibitory Ly49 receptor specific for host MHC class I</title><p>We next examined if the NK cells acquiring function had properties of licensed NK cells. Such cells would be expected to express a receptor specific for an MHC class I allele in the WT host. In particular, Ly49C is an inhibitory NK cell receptor with an H2<sup>b</sup> ligand, H2K<sup>b</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). We hypothesized that if transfer of hyporesponsive &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells into an H2<sup>b</sup> environment results in licensing, we would observe a higher frequency of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> donor NK cells among the Ly49C<sup>+</sup> population than the Ly49C<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population. Indeed, transferred &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Ly49C<sup>+</sup> NK cells made IFN-&#x003b3; at a significantly higher frequency than Ly49C<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK cells (P = 0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Additionally, similar results were observed after stimulation through another NK cell activation receptor, Ly49H (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20100986/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). Therefore, after adoptive transfer of MHC-deficient splenocytes into MHC class I&#x02013;expressing hosts, there is a selective gain of function in NK cells expressing an inhibitory receptor capable of interacting with host MHC class I.</p><p>To extend these findings to other inhibitory Ly49 receptors and MHC ligands, we transferred &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells into KODO (K<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>D<sup>b&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) D8 hosts, which lack H2<sup>b</sup> MHC class Ia heavy chains and display Tg expression of H2D<sup>d</sup>, a ligand for Ly49A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karlhofer et al., 1992</xref>). After transfer, we observed a gain in IFN-&#x003b3; production among Ly49A<sup>+</sup> MHC class I&#x02013;deficient NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), consistent with enhanced responsiveness of Ly49A<sup>+</sup> NK cells in H2D<sup>d</sup>-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we confirmed that there was a selective gain of function for transferred NK cells expressing another inhibitory receptor able to bind to a different host MHC class I molecule.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibitory receptor and cognate MHC I ligand are required for gain-of-function.</bold> (A) Summary of IFN-&#x003b3; production by Ly49A<sup>+</sup> (left) and Ly49A<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (right) donor (&#x003b2;2m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and host NK cells recovered 7 d after adoptive transfer from &#x003b2;2m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or KODO D8 (KD8) hosts after anti-NK1.1 stimulation.

Although these findings were not statistically significant, we hypothesized that expression of other self-MHC&#x02013;specific receptors may contribute to this effect. To investigate this hypothesis, we transferred &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells into SCT-K<sup>b</sup> Tg TKO hosts, which express only a single MHC class I molecule (SCT-K<sup>b</sup>) that binds only one NK cell receptor, Ly49C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). After adoptive transfer, donor Ly49C<sup>+</sup> NK cells gained the ability to produce IFN-&#x003b3; at levels equivalent to that of host Ly49C<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). However, there was no increase in IFN-&#x003b3; production by either donor or host Ly49C<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK cells. Therefore, the interaction between an inhibitory Ly49 receptor and its cognate self&#x02013;MHC class I ligand is necessary for the gain of function observed in hyporesponsive MHC class I&#x02013;deficient NK cells after their adoptive transfer to MHC class I&#x02013;sufficient hosts, consistent with licensing.</p></sec><sec><title>Gain of function extends to NK cell degranulation</title><p>MHC class I&#x02013;deficient NK cells are defective in their cytokine production capacity and in their ability to kill targets as compared with WT NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bix et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">H&#x000f6;glund et al., 1991</xref>).

To further evaluate this possibility, the surface phenotype of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donor cells was assessed after recovery from WT hosts at 7 d after adoptive transfer, a time when donor cells possess the capacity for normal cytokine production and degranulation (Fig. S2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). These experiments indicate that, regardless of the genotype of the host or donor, all NK cells appeared phenotypically indistinguishable in most aspects. For example, markers such as NK1.1, CD94, NKG2A, CD69, DX5, and 2B4 showed no difference in expression between &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT NK cells, before or after adoptive transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).

Therefore, there were minimal changes overall in the expression of most surface molecules after adoptive transfer of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells to WT hosts.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Minimal changes in surface phenotype of MHC class I&#x02013;deficient NK cells after adoptive transfer to WT hosts.</bold> At day 7 after adoptive transfer of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes to WT hosts, unstimulated NK cells were assessed for NK receptor or marker expression by flow cytometry.

This effect was observed for multiple systems in which the inhibitory Ly49 receptors had a known MHC class I ligand in the host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;C</xref>). In particular, decreased Ly49C MFI was specifically observed in cells transferred to the SCT-K<sup>b</sup> Tg TKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>), whereas MFI of Ly49A, a receptor for which no MHC class I ligand is present in this host, remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). However, Ly49A MFI decreased on cells transferred into KODO D8 mice that express the ligand for Ly49A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Thus, decreased Ly49 MFI appears to reflect a specific interaction of an inhibitory receptor on a donor NK cell with a host MHC class I molecule.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Specific reduction in inhibitory Ly49 receptor expression on MHC I-deficient donor NK cells after adoptive transfer into MHC class I&#x02013;expressing hosts.</bold> Splenocytes from &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donors were adoptively transferred into indicated hosts.

The requirement that MHC class I&#x02013;deficient NK cells express an inhibitory receptor specific for host MHC class I to become functional can be interpreted as evidence that these cells become licensed in the MHC class I&#x02013;sufficient host. Importantly, these experiments suggest that licensing of NK cells can occur after their egress from the BM, after the time at which they are believed to have become fully mature. Thus, although it is possible that licensing may occur during NK cell development in vivo, these results demonstrate that licensing is not exclusively a developmental process in the BM.</p><p>In the current experiments, adoptive transfer of NK cells from an MHC-deficient background was performed without host irradiation and subset depletion, thereby minimizing the impact of experimental manipulation on host and donor NK cells. Because WT host NK cells can reject MHC class I&#x02013;deficient grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bix et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">H&#x000f6;glund et al., 1991</xref>), it is possible that host NK cells could have been activated and influenced the function of transferred donor cells. However, we found no evidence of any host NK cell activation. Most importantly, restriction of the gain of function to only those NK cells bearing an inhibitory receptor specific for self-MHC, as was observed, would not be expected if NK cells had been activated by a broad stimulus, such as cytokine stimulation. Thus, it appears that acquisition of activation receptor responsiveness by the MHC-deficient NK cells is a cell-intrinsic property, consistent with a licensed phenotype.</p><p>NK cell receptor&#x02013;ligand interactions can occur in either trans (on different cells) or in cis (on the same NK cell). Importantly, the licensed phenotype of the donor MHC-deficient NK cells in the MHC-sufficient environment indicates that NK cell-intrinsic expression of MHC class I is not strictly a requirement for licensing. This seems to be consistent with trans effects and contradictory to studies suggesting that cis interactions are necessary for education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chalifour et al., 2009</xref>). However, numerous works indicate that NK cells can acquire plasma membrane components from other cells, in a process termed trogocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carlin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sj&#x000f6;str&#x000f6;m et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zimmer et al., 2001</xref>). This may result in the accumulation of enough cognate MHC ligand on the surface of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donor NK cells sufficient to induce the licensing state by cis interactions. Previous studies have suggested that the decreased MFI in this context can be caused, at least in part, by cis interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zimmer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, we found a correlation between decreased MFI for a Ly49 receptor specific for host MHC and the licensed phenotype. Importantly, a similar decrease in inhibitory receptor MFI was reported after adoptive transfer of WT splenocytes to hosts with Tg MHC I-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">K&#x000e5;se et al., 1998</xref>), supporting our observations and suggesting that the phenomenon of decreased inhibitory receptor MFI after exposure to MHC I is not an irregularity of MHC I-deficient cells. Regardless of the mechanism, our data indicate that NK cells may not need to produce their own MHC ligand to be licensed.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that NK cell function in respect to host MHC environment is more plastic than originally anticipated, as in vivo exposure of a peripheral cell to the presence of an inhibitory ligand can alter the functional capacity of the NK cell. As such, these results may have important clinical implications. In particular, patients undergoing BM transplantation experience greater donor-mediated anti-leukemic effect when donor NK cells express KIRs specific for HLA lacking in the patient (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grzywacz et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, within the context of the transfer of peripheral NK cells, such as NK immunotherapy, donor NK cells unlicensed by HLA alleles absent in the donor may become licensed by host HLA alleles, leading to a beneficial gain in reactivity of donor NK cells against host tumors lacking HLA expression. Perhaps prospective pairing of donor KIR along with donor and host HLA to anticipate gain of function by otherwise unlicensed donor NK cells may enhance patient outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD).
