A gentian-positive strain (a "strain-within-a-strain" variant) has been isolated from a pure culture of a gentian-negative organism. This observation corresponds to that of a "strain-within-a-species" variant, occurring in the <italic>enteritidis</italic> group, reported some years ago. 2. The Gram reaction and the gentian reaction do not depend, as has been assumed in previous publications, on the specific affinity of the gentian-positive organisms for a portion of the gentian violet molecule, since certain Gram-negative strains are shown to be gentian-positive. 3. Dead bacterial bodies interposed between living bacteria and gentian violet media partially negative the effect of the dye on Gram-positive organisms and allow them to grow. This seems to be either a phenomenon of filtration or of stimulation of growth. 4. The application of these facts by the method of divided plates shows a number of difficulties in the application of laboratory studies to chemotherapeutics, which would escape observation by ordinary methods. </p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
