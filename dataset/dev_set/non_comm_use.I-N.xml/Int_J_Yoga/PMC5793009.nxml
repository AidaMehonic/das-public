It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Globally, around 300 million people have asthma, with 250,000 annual deaths attributed to the disease, most of which are preventable.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] According to ISAAC group,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] asthma, rhinitis, and eczema in children are increasing in Western and developing countries and the prevalence of wheeze varies widely. The high prevalence (&#x0003e;20%) was generally observed in Latin America and English-speaking countries of Australasia, Europe, and North America as well as South Africa. The low prevalence (&#x0003c;5%) was observed in the Indian subcontinent, Asia-Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean, and Northern and Eastern Europe. The gaps between varied prevalence are now closing, due to a rise in prevalence in low- and middle-income countries and plateauing in high-income countries. The rate of asthma increases as communities adopt Western lifestyles and become urbanized. According to the Global Burden of Asthma Report by Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA),[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with the anticipated increase in the proportion of the world's population, that is, urban, from 45% to 59% in 2025, a marked increase in the number of asthmatics worldwide is projected over the next decades. It is estimated that there may be an additional 100 million persons with asthma by 2025.</p><p>Asthma is a chronic health problem that usually encompasses the patient's entire lifetime and may result in physical, emotional, and social limitations for patients. These limitations often impair quality of life. Asthma can affect patients&#x02019; quality of life in many different ways.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It has been documented that the quality of life impairment in asthma patients is proportional to the severity of disease.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A recent US study found that adolescents with asthma and symptoms reported worse health-related quality of life compared with those with asthma but not reporting symptoms and those without asthma.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] People with asthma suffer from impaired quality of life compared with people without asthma. Rational asthma management leads to disease control and better quality of life. It is, therefore, considerably important to evaluate the quality of life of the patients in addition to the symptoms in order to fully assess the asthma management.</p><p>There have been great efforts to evolve an ideal respiratory questionnaire to assess the health-related quality of life in asthma patients. In recent years, various generic and specific instruments have been developed to estimate the impact that diseases have over the health-related quality of life. The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), developed by Jones <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] is a specific questionnaire for assessing quality of life in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, and is widely used to assess health-related quality of life in asthma patients. In the present study, SGRQ was used to assess the advantage of seven breathing exercises, <italic>Pranayamas</italic>, when added to regular optimal medications, in asthma patients in improving health impairment quality of life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Place of study</title><p>The present study was undertaken at the Departments of Physiology and Respiratory Medicine at our Institute. The patients were attending Respiratory Medicine out-patient department at our Institute where they were diagnosed and clinical care was provided. For the purpose of breathing exercises intervention, the patients attended Yoga Centre in the Department of the Physiology.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study subjects and inclusion criteria</title><p>The diagnosis of asthma was made on the basis of clinical symptoms and presence of variable expiratory airflow limitation. The clinical features considered for asthma diagnosis included (i) presence of any one or more symptoms of wheeze, shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness, (ii) symptoms worsening during night or in the early morning, (iii) symptoms varying over time and intensity, and (iv) symptoms triggered by viral infection, exercise, allergens, change in weather, laughter, or irritants such as smoke, fumes, or strong smells. The diagnosis of asthma in patients with these clinical characteristics was confirmed by spirometry that was assessed before and after the inhaled beta-2-agonist bronchodilators. An increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 s during forced expiratory maneuver (FEV<sub>1</sub>) by 200 ml or more than 12% of baseline value on repeat spirometry 20 min after inhalation of 200 mcg of levosalbutamol given through a metered dose inhaler along with a spacer was considered as a diagnosis of reversible airflow obstruction as per the American Thoracic Society guidelines.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Clinically suspected asthma patients who had reversible airflow obstruction and those who consented for the study as per the study plan were enrolled in the study. All study participants were residing within a radius of 15 km from our institute with easy access to institute for interventional breathing exercises. Patients with any cardiovascular complication were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study design</title><p>Each of eligible asthma patients had a regular follow-up for last 6 months before inclusion to the study and had no hospitalization due to asthma exacerbation during this period. The study patients had regular follow-up visits to clinical department at least once in a month with assessment of their clinical course, relevant laboratory, and spirometric evaluation. The study required a stable course during the last 3 months, and medicines in each patient were optimized before the last 3 months and continued during this period. The same individualized medicines were continued during the study intervention of breathing exercises.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study interventions</title><p>As per the study protocol, all patients continued with their optimum individualized medication throughout the study period. The present study was designed to assess the benefit of addition of 3 months supervised breathing exercises to optimal medications in each study participant. Before being included to the study, the patients received detailed instructions regarding these exercises for 1 week to make the participants acquainted with nature and strenuosity of the exercises and to assess their willingness for consent to the study. After inclusion to the study, the study participants performed breathing exercises daily in front of the instructor for a week, and thereafter, till completion of 3 months, thrice a week on alternate days in front of the instructor and on rest of 4 days per week at home but with full support and understanding to attend the instructor for further supervisions. All patients maintained the diary for recording the duration and timing of the exercises and also to record the symptoms.</p><p>The breathing exercises assessed in the present study were all standard <italic>pranayamas</italic>; we adopted the methods described by Joshi.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The breathing exercises included <italic>Surya Bhedana Pranayama</italic>, <italic>Nadi Shuddi Pranayama</italic>, <italic>Bhramari Pranayama</italic>, <italic>Surya Nadi Pranayama</italic>, <italic>Kapalbhati</italic>, <italic>Bhastrika</italic>, and <italic>Omkar Pranayama/Om Chanting</italic>.

The used SGRQ had a 50-item questionnaire developed to measure health status suggesting quality of life in patients with airways obstruction.

During the last couple of decades, there has been tremendous increase in our understanding regarding the pathogenesis and disease course in asthma leading to significant enhancement of medications armamentarium. In spite of availability of a wide variety of highly effective inhaled and oral pharmacological options for the treatment of asthma, the prevalence of asthma has been constantly increasing, currently very high and also projected to further rise in the near future. Many controlled clinical trials have observed asthma patients achieving high levels of control with optimized pharmacotherapy. However, recent assessments have shown that this optimism was unwarranted; asthma is still among the most common long-term conditions, it is incurable, and outcomes are not improving as expected.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Perhaps, an inappropriate sense of complacency arose with a feeling that we have mastered asthma, and asthma slipped down in priority in the health agenda. In &#x0201c;real-life&#x0201d; practice, poor control of asthma is common with over-reliance on rescue bronchodilator medication and patients continue to suffer from ongoing symptoms and quality-of-life impairment. Surveys show that the majority of people with asthma experience regular symptoms,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] resulting in an impaired ability to lead a full productive life and a huge direct and indirect costs.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] As the normal course of the disease is often characterized by recurrent episodes even with the best medications available, the major focus needs to be shifted to improve quality of life and the psychosocial well-being of asthma patients. The search for missing element to treat asthma may provide scope for nonpharmacological strategies such as breathing exercises, allergen avoidance, and lifestyle changes that we could make use of to help our patients cope better and to reduce the impact of asthma on their lives.</p><p>Breathing exercises are not new and have been taught for hundreds of years in both Eastern and Western societies for numerous conditions including asthma.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Collective evidence from the traditional practice of yoga and other similar physical therapies frequently indicates an improvement and sometimes elimination of asthma symptoms.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] With the introduction of any new pharmacological molecule for control of asthma symptoms, the study trial grants were readily available to research workers by pharmaceutical companies to authenticate their medicines for obvious commercial uses and due to lack of incentives, research in nonpharmacological remained deprived. This is one of the reasons that there are no large-scale multicenter trials for evaluation of efficacy of breathing exercises in asthma patients.</p><p>There have been few studies or trials with small sample size to assess the efficacy of breathing exercises over the asthma outcome. There had been variations across different trials in terms of type of breathing exercise performed, number of study patients included, procedural differences, variations in efficacy parameters, statistical analyses, and outcomes of data. The outcomes more frequently measured were quality of life, asthma symptoms, number of acute exacerbations, and lung function. At least three different breathing techniques are used in these studies: (i) Buteyko method from Russia, (ii) Papworth method from the UK, and (iii) Pranayamas from India.</p><p>The Buteyko method that derives its name from a Ukrainian doctor Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko proposes the use of breathing exercises as a treatment for asthma as well as other conditions such as sleep apnea, anxiety, and others. The Buteyko method is based on the concept that asthma is linked to undiagnosed hyperventilation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The three-core principles of Buteyko are nasal breathing, reduced breathing, and relaxation. The British Thoracic Society stated that the Buteyko method may be considered to help patients control the symptoms of asthma while recognizing the lack of data showing an objective improvement in prior studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In <italic>Papworth Method</italic>, a specific diaphragmatic breathing technique is taught to replace the use of inappropriate accessory muscles of respiration.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Emphasis, when relaxed, is placed on calm, slow nasal expiration. Patients are encouraged for nasal breathing rather than mouth breathing and for reduction of habits such as yawning and sighing.</p><p>The word <italic>Pranayama</italic> has derived from two Sanskrit words: <italic>Prana</italic> = life force and <italic>Yama</italic> = control, or mastery. Sri Patanjali, considered the &#x0201c;father of yoga,&#x0201d; is credited with compiling the Yoga Sutras.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Increasingly, yoga has become a transnational world practice with international followers with observation of the International Yoga Day on June 21, 2015 (the longest day of the year in Northern hemisphere), recognized by the United Nations General Assembly; the same is proposed to be repeated annually. The renewed public interest in physical therapy and other therapies is apparent by the proliferation of self-help books and an increase in the demand for complementary therapies.</p><p>There have been few prior studies which have assessed for the benefits of <italic>Pranayama</italic> or breathing exercises in asthma. The study by Nagarathna and Nagendra included 53 study participants of asthma and found significantly greater improvement in the group who practiced yoga in the weekly number of attacks of asthma, scores for drug treatment, and peak flow rate.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>In another study, yoga training was given for 7 days to nine bronchial asthma patients.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] There was a reduction in sympathetic reactivity and an improvement in the pulmonary ventilation probably due to relaxation of voluntary inspiratory and expiratory muscles. The changes in lifestyle based on yoga training had significant benefits even within a short period.</p><p>One study included patients with bronchial asthma and had a study intervention of deep breathing, <italic>Brahmari</italic>, <italic>Anuloma viloma</italic>, and <italic>Omkara</italic> in 25 study patients along with 25 participants in control group.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] They observed significant improvement in symptoms, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and PEFR. Many other studies[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] have also reported the beneficial effect of various pranayamas breathing exercises in management of asthma.</p><p>Cochrane review in 2013 observed that there were few high-quality studies looking at the efficacy of treating asthma with breathing retraining methods in general, which include the Buteyko method, yoga training, and other relaxation techniques and observed that no reliable conclusions could be determined based on limited available evidence.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] This review concluded that while there are insufficient data for firm conclusions about efficacy, there is enough evidence to justify further trials.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Many studies that have evaluated breathing retraining have some methodological flaws, including small sample sizes; these studies are also hampered by the lack of proper blinding for obvious reasons and placebo control which could have introduce some bias into these studies.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The studies that have assessed quality of life reported an improvement in this outcome. The outcome from majority of studies favors breathing exercises for asthma symptoms though the impact over lung functions has been variable. As a result of substantial heterogeneity among the studies, meta-analysis was possible only for asthma symptoms and changes in the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire and showed a significant difference favoring breathing exercises. The reviews noted these techniques should only be used as adjuncts to conventional pharmacotherapy for symptom control. The British Thoracic Society stated that the Buteyko method might be considered to help patients control the symptoms of asthma while recognizing the lack of data showing an objective improvement in prior studies. The guideline also grades clinical research on Buteyko with a &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; classification &#x02013; indicating that high quality supporting clinical trials are available.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Psychological factors are observed to interact with the asthmatic diathesis to alter the course of the disease. Goyeche <italic>et al</italic>. claimed that the psychosomatic imbalance is present in many, if not all patients with asthma.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Suppressed emotion, anxiety, dependence, and extreme self-consciousness may all be accompanied by generalized and localized muscle tension, including that of the voluntary respiratory musculature. Modification of vagal efferent activity seems to affect the caliber of airways and may actually decrease or increase the effects of pharmacological stimuli on the airways. The role of the psychic factor in inducing or prolonging attacks in acute exacerbations may vary from patient to patient, and in an individual patient, from episode to episode.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>An expert guideline by the GINA noted that breathing exercises may be a useful supplement to asthma pharmacotherapy.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] It has been suggested that improvement in symptoms by breathing exercises may be due to causes other than changes in the underlying physiology of the disease, such as relaxation, voluntary reduction in medication use, and increased participation of the patients in their own care. This result suggests that patients who experience anxiety or who overuse their rescue inhalers, in particular, may benefit from any breathing technique as an adjunct to conventional treatments. Regardless of whether the answers lie in a new physiological explanation or in an understanding of psychological reactions to the presence of a disease, the finding that something has made patients feel better means we cannot ignore this option. However, the supervisory breathing exercises are not available in many parts of the world and even if available cost of using these techniques may be prohibitive.[<xref rid="ref33"
