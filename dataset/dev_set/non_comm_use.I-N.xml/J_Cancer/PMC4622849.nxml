The multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib represents the only systemic treatment option until today, and results from clinical trials with allosteric mTOR inhibitors were sobering. Since the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are frequently upregulated in HCC, we have analyzed the effects of AKT inhibitor MK-2206, MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY 142886) and mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055, given as single drugs or in combination, on proliferation and apoptosis of three HCC cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>. We show that all three inhibitor combinations synergistically inhibit proliferation of the three HCC cell lines, with the strongest synergistic effect observed after vertical inhibition of AKT and mTORC1/2. We demonstrate that AKT kinase activity is restored 24h after blockade of mTORC1/2 by increased phosphorylation of T308, providing a rationale for combined targeting of AKT and mTOR inhibition in HCC. Our data suggest that a combination of inhibitors targeting those respective pathways may be a viable approach for future application in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd><kwd>AKT</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>MEK.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) represents the third most common cause of cancer related mortality, being the sixth most common cancer worldwide <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The greatest burden of the disease is concentrated in Asia and sub-Saharian Africa, where incidence rates are up to five times higher compared to Europe or North America <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, mostly due to the high prevalence of relevant risk factors for the development of HCC, including hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in these countries <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. However, incidence rates for HCC in North America have tripled since 1975 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Treatment approaches depend on the stage of the tumor at diagnosis, and the only curative treatment options being surgical resection or liver transplantation <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. There are no curative treatment approaches for advanced staged HCC, and the only FDA-approved systemic treatment available to date is Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor with modest efficacy in increasing quality-adjusted life-years <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Therefore, new effective treatment strategies are urgently needed. In a study using immunohistochemical analysis of HCC tissue samples, activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was frequently detected, i.e. activation of AKT was detected in 71,5%, and activation of mTOR in 47,5% of HCC samples analyzed <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. AKT, also referred to as Protein kinase B, plays a pivotal role within the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and numerous cellular functions, including proliferation, survival and migration <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a downstream target of PI3K/AKT and acts as an integrator for a variety of stimuli, including mitogens as well as energy- and nutrient-levels, and takes influence on translation, proliferation and autophagy <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. There is a complex interaction between AKT and mTOR, given that mTORC2 phosphorylates AKT within the carboxyterminus, which is required for full kinase activity of AKT, and AKT in turn controlls mTOR activity via regulation of the TSC1/2-complex <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has been shown to be related to a poor overall prognosis in gastrointestinal and gynecological carcinoma <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Specifically in HCC, mTOR activation appears to be associated with less differentiated tumors, poor survival and early recurrence after resection <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Allosteric inhibitors of mTOR have been in the focus of oncological research for a long time <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. However, recent results from the EVOLVE-1 trial using RAD001 as monotherapy in advanced HCC were desillusionating, since no significant difference in overall survival could be detected <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. With an emerging understanding of the importance of mTORC2 signaling in tumorigenesis, compounds like the novel, highly selective, ATP competitive mTOR inhibitor AZD8055, that targets both mTORC1 and mTORC2, might therefore provide a therapeutic superiority compared to rapalogs, which primarily inhibit mTORC1 signaling <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. In this context, a feedback mechanism was demonstrated which restores a substantial part of AKT activity even after effective blockade of mTORC2 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. To further address the functional role of AKT and mTOR in HCC cell lines, we analyzed the combined effects of AZD8055 and the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206, that is currently being evaluated in numerous clinical trials <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.</p><p>The RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays a critical role in cancer development and progression, and was shown to be activated in up to 58% of all HCC samples analyzed <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a downstream kinase of many cell surface receptors, including EGFR, IGFR, MET and others <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, and has a wide range of substrates, which ultimately promote proliferation, cell survival, invasion and migration <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. AZD6244 (ARRY-142886), also referred to as Selumetinib, is a selective allosteric inhibitor of the MEK1/2 kinases and can be used to disrupt downstream signaling to ERK. The efficacy of AZD6244 alone or combined with Sorafenib has already been demonstrated in a xenograft HCC model, and clinical trials have been initiated <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Both, the RAF/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways play an important role in the control of cell proliferation and survival. There is evidence of a diligent cross-regulation between these two pathways and results from previous studies suggest a high level of functional redundancy between them <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of both pathways appears to be reasonable and has been shown to be effective in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. In this study, we demonstrate that combined targeting of AKT, mTOR and MEK/ERK using MK-2206, AZD6244 and AZD8055 is efficacious and synergistic in the inhibition of HCC cell proliferation. Our results suggest that dual targeting of AKT and mTOR, as well as AKT and MEK might be a promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>AZD8055 and AZD6244 were obtained from SelleckChem (Absource Diagnostics GmbH, Munich, Germany).

Constitutive activation of both pathways was detected by Western blot analysis, as previously described (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref> and <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We then analyzed the efficacy of the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 and the mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 in suppressing the activity of their corresponding downstream targets ERK and S6, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>. Of note, AZD6244 was unable to suppress phosphorylation of ERK at T202/Y204 even at 1000nM, probably due to a relief of the feedback inhibition of BRAF, as indicated by the concomitant increase in pMEK <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. MK-2206 has been evaluated in the three HCC cell lines before as published by our group in <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. To assess the impact of AZD6244 and AZD8055 on proliferation, the three HCC cell lines were treated with a broad range of concentrations over 72h, and proliferation was measured by BrdU incorporation (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>). AZD8055 caused a strong reduction in growth of Hep3B and Huh-7, with IC50 values of 47.9 nM and 24.5 nM respectively. However, AZD8055 failed to induce a fifty percent inhibition of proliferation in HepG2 cells even at a concentration of 1000 nM. Conversely, HepG2 cells were highly susceptible for the MEK-Inhibitor AZD6244, with an IC50 value of 27.8 nM, whereas IC50 value was 3031 nM for Huh7 cells. Hep3B appeared to be intrinsically resistant to AZD6244 with an IC50 value of greater than 10 &#x000b5;M and minimal influence on proliferation even at high concentrations. The effects of MK-2206 on these HCC cell lines were described before by our group <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Next, we analyzed the efficacy of combining AKT and mTOR, AKT and MEK, or mTOR and MEK inhibition in these cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>Combined targeting of AKT and MEK synergistically inhibited proliferation of all HCC cell lines, although the synergistic effect appears less prominent in HepG2 cell line because of its high susceptibility to AZD6244. Fractional effect blots for all cell lines and combinations treatments can be found in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3</xref>. Similar results have been reported previously in NSCLC, thyroid cancer and cholangicarcinoma cell lines <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>.</p><p>Vertical inhibition of the AKT-mTOR pathway by combining MK-2206 and AZD8055 yielded robust synergistic effects in the three cell lines, even at low concentrations. Finally, combining MEK inhibitor AZD6244 with the mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 resulted in weak synergistic or mere additive effects in Hep3B and Huh7 cells, whereas the combination was strongly synergistic in HepG2 cells. Similar results were observed when we performed cell cycle analysis of HCC cell lines treated with the afore-mentioned compounds and combinations, as seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A. The combination of MK-2206 and AZD8055, which has shown the most robust impact on proliferation, caused an almost complete reduction of cells in S and G2 phase in Hep3B and Huh-7. Finally, we analyzed the induction of apoptosis in HCC cell lines after treatment with these inhibitors, either alone or in combination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). We observed a strong induction of apoptosis only in HepG2 cells when treated with AZD6244 alone or in combination with 2206.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of intracellular signalling by Western blot</title><p>Next, the effects of MK-2206, AZD6244, AZD8055 and their combinations on intracellular signaling in HCC cells were analyzed by western blot, as seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. All inhibitors effectively suppressed the phosphorylation of their respective downstream targets, i.e. AKT, ERK and S6, with the exception of AZD6244 in Huh-7, as described above. Correspondingly, proliferation of Huh-7 cells was almost unaffected at low doses of AZD6244. Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref> demonstrates that although pERK is initially suppressed by addition of AZD6244 within the first 6 hours, it then quickly recovers and restores its former level within 12h following treatment onset. Neither the AKT inhibitor MK-2206, nor the mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 alone were able to significantly reduce the level of pGSK3&#x003b2; (S9) in any of the cell lines analyzed, even though both had a distinct impact on pAKT (S473). However, the combination of both compounds resulted in a synergistic inhibition of pGSK3&#x003b2; levels. This combination also resulted in a more thorough reduction of phosphorylation of mTOR substrate 4EBP-1 at S65, compared to AZD8055 alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of mTORC2 causes elevated phosphorylation of AKT at threonine residue 308 (T308), accompanied by increased residual AKT activity</title><p>Treatment with mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 results in an effective suppression of phosphorylation of AKT at S473 in all three HCC cell lines, as seen in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>. However, phosphorylation at T308 shows a rapid recovery to its original or even higher level within 24 to 48 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). To further investigate the significance of this interaction between AKT and mTOR after mTORC1/2 inhibition in HCC cells, the kinase activity of AKT was measured directly by an in vitro kinase assay. As demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B, addition of AZD8055 reduces AKT activity to approximately 15% compared to baseline after 3 h, but is then restored to about 35% within 24h following treatment. This increase of AKT activity correlates to an increase in pAKT T308 of up to four times compared to baseline, whereas pAKT S473 remains strongly suppressed. We also observed a concomitant increase in pGSK3&#x003b2; S9 over time as a readout of the restoration of AKT activity, as seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A. This is in line with results published by Rodrik-Outmezguine et al <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and our own findings in cholangicarcinoma cell lines <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, suggesting that the increased phosphorylation of AKT at T308 is sufficient for a residual enzymatic activity of AKT. These results also illustrate the rationale for vertical targeting of AKT and mTOR for cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown of AKT1 and AKT2 in Huh-7 cells is synergistic with inhibition of mTOR</title><p>To underline the importance of AKT signaling after mTOR inhibition, we generated Huh-7 AKT1/AKT2 double knockdown cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). Proliferation of control cells treated with DMSO, MK-2206, AZD8055, or the combination of both, and AKT1/2 double knockdown cells treated with DMSO or AZD8055 was measured by cell counting after 72h. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, combined MK2206 or knockdown of AKT1/2 with AZD8055 results in an additional inhibition of proliferation compared to inhibition of mTOR or AKT alone.</p></sec><sec><title>HepG2 cells overcome high apoptosis induction of AZD6244 after prolonged treatment</title><p>Among the three HCC cell lines analyzed, HepG2 cells were most susceptible to MEK inhibitor AZD6244, and a strong induction of apoptosis was only observed in these cells, reflecting the importance of ERK1/2 signaling in HepG2 cells harboring a NRAS mutation <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. To investigate the impact of prolonged exposure to AZD6244, HepG2 cells were cultivated in medium containing 5 &#x000b5;M AZD6244 for six months (these cells will be referred to as HepG2R). As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A, proliferation of HepG2R cells was still affected by AZD6244, but they were significantly more resistant compared to parental HepG2 cells. Furthermore, AZD6244, alone or in combination with MK-2206 or AZD8055, failed to induce apoptosis in HepG2R cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). This is in contrast to the strong induction of apoptosis observed in parental HepG2 cells after treatment with these drugs as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Rapid development of MEKi resistance has been well documented in other cell lines as well, and reflects a not yet overcome challenge in the clinical application of BRAF and MEK inhibitors <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. Of note, HepG2R cells were also resistant to MEK inhibitor PD0325901, but HepG2R cells were still susceptible to multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sorafenib, as seen in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>. HepG2R cells were then treated with AZD6244 either in combination with MK-2206 or AZD8055, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C. However, in HepG2R cells only the combination of MK-2206 and AZD8055 resulted in a stronger inhibition of proliferation, whereas the combination of AZD6244 with MK-2206, or AZD8055, even had strong antagonistic effects compared to MK-2206 or AZD8055 alone.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of combined targeting of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway, as well as vertical targeting of AKT and mTOR in HCC cell lines.

This might be due to intrinsic resistance of cancer cells <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, as well as feedback mechanisms and redundancy among signaling pathways, alleviating the drug effect <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>. For example, RAD001 was shown to be only effective in KRAS wild type breast cancer cell lines harboring PI3KCA mutations <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, whereas activating mutations in KRAS results in intrinsic resistance. Furthermore, inhibition of AKT using MK-2206 or mTOR using AZD8055 was shown to result in increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, indicative of a compensatory activation of this signaling pathway <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Therefore, inhibitor combinations could be used to disrupt critical feedback mechanisms, to overcome intrinsic drug resistance and therefore induce more profound clinical responses <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. Combining the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 with the allosteric MEK inhibitor AZD6244 was synergistic in all three HCC cell lines, in line with previous results in another HCC cell line as well as NSCLC cell lines <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. Of note, HepG2 was the only HCC cell line tested that exhibited a strong induction of apoptosis after treatment with AZD6244. Induction of apoptosis is supposed to be an important effect of this inhibitor <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, and the effect was augmented by the addition of MK-2206. The high susceptibility of HepG2 cells for AZD6244 demonstrates the potential use of NRAS/BRAF mutation status as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to treatment with RAF/MEK inhibitors in HCC patients <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, although these mutations are detected in only 1-2% of all HCC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic</ext-link>; 03/2015). A list of mutated cancer genes as reported in the COSMIC Cell Lines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cell_lines">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cell_lines</ext-link>) database can be found in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>. For HepG2, only CTNNB1 (&#x003b2;-catenin) and NRAS-mutations have been reported <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>. NRAS<sup>Q61L</sup> mutation is the only present aberration known to predict sensitivity to MEK-inhibitor AZD6244 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. No correlation between sensitivity to MK-2206, or AZD8055 has been reported for any other mutation listed in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>. Copy number alterations of the three HCC cell lines were analyzed by Chen et al. <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, reporting an EGFR-amplification in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. Amplification of EGFR might result in an activation of downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. In preclinical models, activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling correlated with sensitivity to drugs targeting this pathway <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>. However, there is only limited validation for this association in the clinical setting <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>. Taken together, the possibility to predicting the sensitivity of cell lines to inhibitors targeting AKT and mTOR is limited, and reliable biomarkers still need to be identified. We have further demonstrated that AZD6244 was unable to achieve a suppression of pERK at low to moderate doses in the less responsive cell lines Hep3B and Huh7 due to a rapid rebound activation upstream of pERK, restoring pERK levels to its original level. A similar effect was observed in melanoma cells harboring KRAS mutations, correlating with a poor response to MEK inhibition <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>. These finding underline the importance of appropriate patient selection before therapy initiation using molecular targeted inhibitors. We also investigated the effect of long-term exposure of HepG2 cells to AZD6244, demonstrating that HepG2 cells become resistant to the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect of AZD6244 within a few months. Combining AZD6244 with either MK-2206 or AZD8055 was unable to reverse the acquired resistance against AZD6244, and we observed even an antagonistic interaction in these combinations. However, HepG2R cells appeared to be more susceptible to treatment with the AKT-inhibitor MK-2206 alone, compared to parental HepG2 cells, and the combination of AZD8055 and MK-2206 still had a weak, synergistic inhibitory effect of HepG2R proliferation. We found the combination of AKT inhibitor MK-2206 and mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 to be most effective in all three HCC cell lines analyzed, resulting in a synergistic inhibition of proliferation even at low concentrations. This is in line with previous results from our group as well as others demonstrating the efficacy of vertical targeting <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>. Here, we have shown that AKT activity is significantly reduced after the initial administration of AZD8055, but quickly recovers to around 35% of the baseline value within the first 24 hours of treatment. This process is accompanied by an increase in pAKT T308, although pAKT S473, which is considered to be most important for full AKT activity and is generated by mTOR complex 2, was thoroughly suppressed throughout the whole time course <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>. The increased phosphorylation at T308 is caused by the relief of feedback inhibition on RTK signaling, as previously demonstrated <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. We assume that this feedback mechanism plays an important role for the synergistic effects of vertical AKT/mTOR inhibition, and we confirmed this interaction using a dual knockdown of AKT1 and AKT2 in Huh7 cells. Combining the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 and the mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 resulted in only weak synergistic effects in the three HCC cell lines tested. The same agents were used in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, showing strong synergistic effects due to the suppression of a feedback loop between ERK, mTOR and AKT, which was able to maintain tumor cell viability as long as only one signaling pathway was targeted <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>. A study on uveal melanoma cells demonstrated that the susceptibility for this inhibitor combination depends on further genetic alterations, especially the presence of guanine nucleotide-binding protein, q polypeptide (GNAQ) mutations, rendering cells less sensitive to MEK inhibitors <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>. However, GNAQ-mutations appear to be extremely rare in HCC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic</ext-link>; 03/2015).</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated the efficacy of inhibitors targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-, and the RAS/MEK/ERK pathways in HCC cell lines. Combining the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 with either the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, or the mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 resulted in synergistic effects in all three HCC cell lines. We observed the strongest antitumor potential after combined inhibition of AKT and mTOR in Hep3B and Huh7 cells, whereas HepG2 cells were most susceptible to combined inhibition of MEK and AKT/mTOR. Generally, exploiting synergistic effects by combining two or more targeted therapies might allow treatment protocols with lower inhibitor doses, causing less side effects, while still sustaining sufficient impact on cancer cells. Therefore, our results might be used to guide future preclinical and clinical trials to evaluate new, effective treatment regimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><caption><p>Table S1, Figures S1-S5.</p></caption><media xlink:href="jcav06p1195s1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term id="GL1">BrdU</term><def><p>5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL2">CI</term><def><p>combination index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL3">DMSO</term><def><p>dimethyl sulfoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL4">HCC</term><def><p>hepatocellular carcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL5">mTOR</term><def><p>mammalian target of rapamycin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL6">PBS</term><def><p>phosphate buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL7">PI3K</term><def><p>phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Ferenci</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Fried</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Labrecque</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruix</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sherman</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Omata</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/><article-title>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): a global perspective</article-title><source>Journal of clinical gastroenterology</source><year>2010</year><volume>44</volume><fpage>239</fpage><lpage>45</lpage>
