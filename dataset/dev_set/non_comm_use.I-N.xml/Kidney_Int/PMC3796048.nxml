Here, we found that heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) expression levels increased in the kidneys of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) knockout and eNOS knockout diabetic (Lepr db/db) mice as early as 8 weeks of age. Further increases in expression were only seen in eNOS knockout diabetic mice and paralleled the progression of glomerulopathy. HB-EGF expression increased in endothelium, podocytes, and tubular epithelial cells. In cultured glomerular endothelial cells, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or L-N5-(1-Iminoethyl) ornithine increased HB-EGF protein expression. Administration of L-NAME dramatically increased renal HB-EGF expression and urinary HB-EGF excretion in diabetic mice. On the other hand, replenishing nitric oxide with sodium nitrate in eNOS knockout diabetic mice reduced urinary HB-EGF excretion and inhibited the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, specific deletion of HB-EGF expression in endothelium attenuated renal injury in diabetic eNOS knockout mice. Thus, our results suggest that decreased nitric oxide bioavailability leads to increased HB-EGF expression, which may be an important mediator of the resulting progressive diabetic nephropathy in eNOS knockout diabetic mice.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Diabetes has become a pandemic disease, affecting both developing and developed countries.

Tubular casts with strong HB-EGF immunostaining were also observed in 16-week old eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/Lepr<sup>db/db</sup> mouse kidneys (data not shown). Although eNOS was first identified in vascular endothelium, it is widely expressed in many nephron segments, notably in TAL and collecting duct.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p id="P22">Increased urinary HB-EGF excretion was seen predominantly in eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/Lepr<sup>db/db</sup> mice. HB-EGF localized to the apical surface of the tubular epithelial cells, even though basolateral localization could also be detected occasionally. In situ hybridization also showed HB-EGF mRNA expression in distal nephron, indicating that the source of the observed increases in tubular HB-EGF protein was more likely from local synthesis than from binding of secreted HB-EGF from the tubular fluid to membrane-associated proteoglycans. Progressive increases in urinary HB-EGF excretion in eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/Lepr<sup>db/db</sup> mice correlated with, and may be related to, underlying renal damage. Further studies will be required to determine whether the glomeruli or distal tubules are the source of the urinary HB-EGF.</p><p id="P23">Previous studies have implicated abnormalities in NO production in the development of diabetic nephropathy, although the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear. Although elevated NO levels were detected in both serum and urine after NaNO3 treatment, cGMP content in the kidney was not altered significantly. This is consistent with studies by Kumar et al. indicating that nitrite therapy did not induce significant increases in ischemic tissue cGMP levels. This group speculated that chronic nitrite therapy may increase ischemic tissue blood flow and stimulate arteriogenesis by modulating other endothelial cell signaling pathways such as Erk1/2 or PKC.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p id="P24">In a recent study, Bollee et al. demonstrated a pathogenic role for HB-EGF activation of glomerular EGFR signaling in a mouse model of anti-GBM disease. Although elevated expression levels of EGFR were also observed in the glomeruli of eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/Lepr<sup>db/db</sup> mice (data not shown), the role of the HB-EGF&#x02013;EGFR pathway in the development of DN in this model will require further investigation. However, the reverse correlation between HB-EGF expression and renal structural and functional alterations suggests that HB-EGF may be an important mediator of diabetic renal injury seen with decreased NO availability.</p><p id="P25">In conclusion, our results suggest that decreased NO bioavailability is a significant contributor to the increased HB-EGF expression in both eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/Lepr<sup>db/db</sup> mice, with further increases in HB-EGF expression secondary to the diabetic milieu. Under normal physiologic conditions, NO may negatively regulate HB-EGF expression, while with inhibition of NO expression and/or activity, loss of this negative regulation may contribute to increased HB-EGF expression, which might act as a mediator of glomerular damage.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>CONCISE METHODS</title><sec id="S12"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p id="P26">D-(+)-glucose, D-mannitol, SIGMAFAST<sup>&#x02122;</sup> 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine tablets, paraformaldehyde, streptozotocin, tamoxifen, rabbit anti-human podocin antibody, goat anti-mouse EGFR antibody, and anti-&#x003b2;-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); N<sup>G</sup>-Nitro-L-arginine methyl Ester (L-NAME) and L-N5-(1-Iminoethyl) ornithine (L-NIO) were from EMD4Biosciences (Gibbstown, NJ).
