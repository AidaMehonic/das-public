All the patients were operated covering the defect with fascia lata allograft. All procedures were performed by the same surgeon. The study group consisted of 38 men and 30 women, with average age of 64.9 years (range 43&#x02013;81 years), who were followed up for a mean of 43 months (range 31&#x02013;77 months). Operations were done within 48 right and 20 left shoulders, of which 55 were the dominant side and all were primary repairs and not revisions. The study included all patients which had at least two ruptured tendons, measuring more than 5 cm in maximal diameter, proven by MRI [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] and confirmed at the time of surgery, impossible to be reparable with simple suture, without producing tension at the repair site, even with release of the tendons. No patient was excluded who do not fulfill the above criteria except in patients suffering from advanced glenohumeral arthritis, because of stiffness which can develop in these patients. All tears that fixed in this way were 5&#x02013;7 cm and the measurement performed at the time of surgery. The graft modified until match the respective tear each time. In our study, as far as muscular atrophy is concerned, all patients had retraction of the involved muscles with fatty replacement (three and above, by Goutallier score), observed in preoperative MRI. Patients were symptomatic, with pain, mainly nocturnal, and decreased function, despite all conservative treatment. Patients were evaluated with preoperative and postoperative constant score, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and followup ultrasound examination.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> All patients were evaluated with preoperative, in 4 and 12 months postoperative constant score, 10 patients underwent MRI in 8 months postoperatively while 30 other patients underwent ultrasound in 12 months postoperatively. The remaining 28 patients were unwilling to undergo further testing because they were satisfied with the clinical outcome. However, all 68 patients were measured with a constant score preoperatively, 4 and 12 months postoperatively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Preoperative coronal MR image demonstrates massive tear and proximal retraction (arrow) of the rotator cuff</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-49-304-g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical details of patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-49-304-g002"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Operative procedure</title><p>Under general anesthesia, the patients were placed in the beach chair position. A lateral approach of the shoulder was performed followed by careful deltoid detachment from the anterior acromion. The edges of the involved tendons were then identified, debrided and mobilized by sequential releases (anterior and posterior) confirming that simple suture repair was impossible without excessive tension due to tendon retraction [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The greater tuberosity was then prepared with lightly shaving of its cortical bone. The size of the r-c tear was then measured, and the fascia lata allograft was hydrated in a sterile solution for 30 min and cut to the proper size according to the measurements. The source of the fascia lata allografts is cadaveric donors. The procurement, processing, and storage of these allografts is in accordance with the EU directives for human tissue and the standards set by the American Association of tissue banks and the Food and Drug Administration. Tissue derived by cadaveric donors has all the necessary approvals and consent for its further use as allograft. The allografts have been processed by Osteotech Inc., (A Medtronic Company) in the USA.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Intraoperative photograph showing an irreparable rotator cuff tear.

During the closure of the wound, it is very important for the postoperative outcome of the shoulder function the correct re-attachment of the deltoid back to the acromion via transosseous insertion with suture (PDS No. 1-Ethicon). All patients received three doses of intravenous antibiotics (cefazolin).

Similar increments occurred in regards to abduction from 4.2 to 8.3, and to external rotation from 4.1 to 8.5, 12 months postoperatively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. In all 10 patients who underwent a followup MRI, the results were confusing regarding the structural integrity of the graft due mainly to altering of the magnetic signal by the graft. On the other hand, of the other 30 patients who underwent ultrasound examination at the final followup in 12 months, 27 showed an intact graft, at the anatomical location of the r-c, without a new rupture at the repair site [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>] and only in three patients there was a retear of the graft observed.

Several studies, mainly in animal models, have evaluated the bridging of the irreparable r-c tear by graft and the results have a studying interest, because the outcomes are various. Specifically, Neviaser <italic>et al.</italic> in 1978, first reported poor results in 14 of 16 patients by use of a freeze-dried allograft to repair the r-c defect.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Nasca reported only two satisfactory results in a series of 13 cases, utilizing the same materials and methods as Neviaser.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Moore <italic>et al.</italic> reported complete radiographic failure of all 15 human allografts.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> while Galatz documented similar failures, but with improved pain and motion, despite residual tears documented on MRI.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Dejardin reported that porcine small intestine submucosa (SIS) was an effective solution,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> while Sclamberg <italic>et al.</italic> evaluated the use of SIS which also showed disappointing results with clinical and MRI findings consistent with a retear in 10 out of 11 patients.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Kimura <italic>et al.</italic> reported all specimens failed after use of polytetrafluoroethylene synthetic graft to address irreparable tears of the infraspinatus in dogs.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Adams <italic>et al.</italic> presented an acellular human dermal allograft matrix to repair infraspinatus defects in dogs and they noted an almost normal tendon structure at the repair site.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Finally, Sano <italic>et al.</italic> presented the use of fascial autograft to repair supraspinatus defects in rabbits and they found a normal tendon structure at 8 weeks, with histologic incorporation of the graft.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Because of the good results of using fascia lata in animal models, we decided to use a fascia lata allograft to bridge the massive irreparable r-c tear in humans and to record the results.</p><p>The fascia lata is the deep fascia of the thigh, originating from the tensor fascia lata muscle and inserting into Gerdy's tubercle at the knee,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and it has been used with success for other ligament or tendon reconstructions, having the ability to gradually remodel into a tendinous tissue, similar to a normal tendon.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Moreover, based on its mechanical, chemical, and ultrastructural similarity to tendon, fascia lata has the advantage to be natural, strong, large, providing good suture retention and enhanced healing.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The allograft is preserved with a proprietary freeze-drying method that retains its natural structure, is prehydrated, sterilized, but needs to be rinsed before using.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Indications for use of the patch were a massive, irreparable r-c tear and/or significant fatty degeneration.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A relative contraindication was advanced glenohumeral arthritis, because of stiffness which can develop in these patients.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> There are many factors that can affect the success of tissue grafting such as the properties of the graft material selected, the degree of muscle atrophy, tendon quality, rehabilitation protocol, use of nicotine or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and repair method.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Burkhart <italic>et al.</italic> have suggested that lower r-c repair tension may provide less mechanoreceptor stimulation and therefore potentially less pain.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In our study, as far as muscular atrophy is concerned, all patients had retraction of the involved muscles with fatty replacement (three and above, by Goutallier score), observed in preoperative MRI and confirmed at the time of surgery, which was not reversed based on MRI postoperatively.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Preoperatively patients were symptomatic, with pain, mainly nocturnal and decreased ROM of the affected shoulder, being unable to perform their daily activities, hobbies and work. The postoperative evaluation of all patients that participated in our study, revealed significant improvement in scores, mainly in pain relief, nocturnal sleep without discomfort, but mainly patient's satisfaction, because they were able now to perform daily and leisure activities and finally a very good ROM, including flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation of their shoulder. A significant complication, such as infection or rejection of the graft was not evidenced, which confirms the biocompatibility of the fascia lata allograft. However, our study has some weaknesses. The postoperative MRI was of limited diagnostic quality, because of the relative poor resolution, without being able to assess clearly the graft integrity.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Furthermore, many patients did not wish to undergo MRI because of their claustrophobia. Therefore, we believe that better quality MRI and the use of arthrography may offer more information about the grafts. There is much controversy in the orthopedic literature regarding the efficacy of MRI in the evaluation of postoperative shoulders and especially re-tears of the repair site with graft interposition<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> On the other hand, ultrasound seems to be more accurate for graft interpretation, but not all patients willing to undergo further examinations, because they were satisfied with the clinical outcome. However, all 68 patients were measured with a constant score preoperatively, 4 and 12 months postoperatively, and the results were in line with their clinical status. In summary, based on the results of our study, it appears that fascia lata allograft used to repair the massive r-c tear acts as a substitute and may offer a useful tool in situations in which repair would be otherwise impossible, offering a different strategy in this intractable problem.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref17"
