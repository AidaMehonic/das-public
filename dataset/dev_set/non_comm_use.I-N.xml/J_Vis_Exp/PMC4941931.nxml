High throughput sequencing technologies have allowed for the rapid and efficient characterization of bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing from a variety of sources. Although readily available tools for 16S rRNA sequence analysis have standardized computational workflows, sample processing for DNA extraction remains a continued source of variability across studies. Here we describe an efficient, robust, and cost effective method for extracting nucleic acid from swabs. We also delineate downstream methods for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, including generation of sequencing libraries, data quality control, and sequence analysis. The workflow can accommodate multiple samples types, including stool and swabs collected from a variety of anatomical locations and host species. Additionally, recovered DNA and RNA can be separated and used for other applications, including whole genome sequencing or RNA-seq. The method described allows for a common processing approach for multiple sample types and accommodates downstream analysis of genomic, metagenomic and transcriptional information.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd>Molecular Biology</kwd><kwd>Issue 110</kwd><kwd>Microbiome</kwd><kwd>metagenomics</kwd><kwd>16S</kwd><kwd>DNA extraction</kwd><kwd>RNA extraction</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>human sequencing</kwd><kwd>next-generation sequencing</kwd><kwd>high-throughput sequencing</kwd><kwd>vaginal</kwd><kwd>stool</kwd><kwd>swab</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><fig id="Fig_53939" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><alternatives><media id="Video_53939" xlink:href="jove-110-53939.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor"/><graphic xlink:href="jove-110-53939-thumb"/></alternatives></fig><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The human lower reproductive tract, gastrointestinal system, respiratory tract, and skin are colonized by complex bacterial communities that are critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis and supporting the health of the host<sup>1</sup>. For instance, certain lactobacilli create an inhospitable environment for pathogens by acidifying the vaginal vault, producing antimicrobial effectors and modulating local host immunity<sup>2-4</sup>. The growing appreciation for the bacterial microbiome's importance has also increased interest in characterizing bacterial communities in many clinical contexts. Here we describe a method to determine the composition of the bacterial microbiome from genital swabs. The protocol can be readily modified for stool samples and swabs collected from other anatomical locations and other host species.</p><p>Due to the inherent limitations in the number of samples that can be collected and stored from a given study participant, this protocol was designed to extract DNA, RNA, and potentially even protein from a single swab using an adapted phenol-chloroform based bead-beating method<sup>5,6</sup>. The combination of physical disruption of bacterial cell walls with bead-beating and chemical disruption with detergents allows rapid lysis of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and acid-fast bacteria without additional enzymatic digestion steps. To obtain high quality RNA, it is recommended to use dry swabs that were kept at or below 4 &#x000b0;C immediately after collection and during transport to the laboratory (if applicable), and stored long-term at -80 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>To determine the bacterial microbiome within a given sample, this procedure utilizes 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, which is currently the most cost-effective means to comprehensively assign bacterial taxonomy and perform relative quantification. Alternative methods include targeted qPCR<sup>7</sup>, custom microarrays<sup>8</sup>, and whole-genome sequencing<sup>9</sup>. The 16S rRNA gene contains nine hypervariable regions, and there is no consensus regarding the optimal V region to sequence for vaginal microbiome studies. Here we use the 515F/806R primer set and build on the pipeline designed by Caporaso <italic>et al.</italic><sup>10-12</sup>. Caporaso <italic>et al.</italic>'s 515F/806R primer set enables multiplexing of hundreds of samples on a single sequencing run due to the availability of thousands of validated barcoded primers and compatibility with Illumina sequencing platforms. Unlike the Human Microbiome Project's 27F/338R primer set<sup>13</sup>, 515F/806R also effectively amplifies <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic> and thus accurately captures <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, an important member of the vaginal microbial community in some women. Alternatively, a 338F/806R primer pair has been successfully used for pyrosequencing of vaginal samples<sup>14</sup> and a 515F/926R primer pair has recently become available for next-generation sequencing<sup>12</sup>.</p><p>Finally, this protocol provides basic instructions to perform 16S amplicon analysis using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software package<sup>15</sup>. Successful implementation of the QIIME commands described here yields a table containing bacterial taxonomic abundances for each sample. Many additional quality control steps, taxonomic classification methods, and analysis steps can be incorporated into the analysis, as described in detail on the QIIME website (http://qiime.org/index.html). If the analysis will be performed on an Apple computer, the MacQIIME package<sup>16</sup> provides easy installation of QIIME and its dependencies. Alternative software packages for 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis include Mothur<sup>17</sup> and UPARSE<sup>18</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol</title><p>The study protocol was approved by and followed the guidelines of the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (Durban, South Africa) and the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board (2012P001812/MGH; Boston, MA).</p><sec><title>1.

The mapping file is not only required for executing QIIME, but it also enables the researcher to maintain the link between the sample barcode and metadata, to analyze the data for any systematic biases (<italic>e.g., </italic>batch-to-batch variation), and to determine interesting correlations between the metadata and bacterial populations. A bare-bones mapping file is provided, but users are encouraged to add as many columns containing metadata as possible. Examples of additional metadata for a vaginal swab includes the participant's age, date/time of swab collection, hormonal contraceptive type (if applicable), sexually transmitted infection testing results, etc.</p><p><graphic xlink:href="jove-110-53939-5.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><bold>Supplemental File 1.

This protocol can easily be adapted for other sample types, such as stool and swabs of other body sites, and for samples collected from a wide variety of sources. The extraction of nucleic acid by bead-beating in a buffered solution of phenol and chloroform allows for isolation of both DNA and RNA, which is particularly important when working with precious samples collected through clinical studies. The isolated bacterial DNA is excellent for bacterial taxonomic identification and genomic assembly, while the simultaneous collection of RNA provides the opportunity to determine functional bacterial, host, and viral contributions through RNA-seq. The described protocol uses a validated one-step primer set that has been successfully deployed on a wide range of sample types, including human, canine, and environmental samples<sup>10</sup>. The availability of thousands of barcoded primers enables multiplexing of samples and tremendous savings on sequencing costs. The complete cost (including all reagents, a single sequencing run, and primers but not equipment) is about $20 per sample when 200 samples are multiplexed. Additionally, there is very high reproducibility when multiple swabs from the same sample site are processed independently through the entire pipeline. Overall, the protocol is cost efficient, flexible, reliable, and repeatable.</p><p>The nucleic acid extraction portion of this protocol is limited by the safety precautions required when working with phenol and chloroform, and the challenges of automating the pipeline to a high-throughput, 96-well plate format. Additionally, the vigorous bead beating used for mechanical lysis shears the bacterial DNA to approximately 6 kilobase fragments; if longer DNA fragments are required for downstream applications, the duration of bead beating should be shortened. The limitations of the bacterial identification portion of this protocol are inherent to any method that relies on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 16S rRNA sequencing is ideal for bacterial identification to the genus and even species level, but rarely provides strain level identification. While the V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene provides robust discrimination amongst most bacterial species<sup>11</sup>, additional computational methods such as Oligotyping<sup>31</sup> may need to be used to precisely identify certain species, such as <italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</italic>. Finally, information about the precise bacterial functional capabilities within a particular sample cannot be determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing alone, though this protocol enables extraction of whole genome DNA and RNA that can be used towards this purpose.</p><p>The most critical step to ensuring success with this protocol is taking great care to prevent contamination during sample collection, nucleic acid extraction, and PCR amplification. Ensure sterility at the time of sample collection by wearing clean gloves and using sterile swabs, tubes, and scissors. To assess for contamination of the collection materials, collect negative control swabs by placing additional unused swabs directly into transport tubes at the time of sampling. In the lab, perform all pre-amplification steps in a sterilized hood containing only decontaminated supplies and using only molecular grade, DNA-free reagents. During nucleic acid extraction, prevent cross-contamination by using new sterile forceps and fresh gloves with each sample, and keeping all tubes closed unless in use. Processing unused swabs in parallel ensures sterility of both the sample collection and nucleic acid extraction; the unused swabs should not yield a pellet after isopropanol precipitation and ethanol washing. If a pellet does appear, perform 16S rRNA gene amplification to determine a possible source of the contamination (<italic>e.g., </italic> the presence of <italic>Streptococcus </italic>or <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> would indicate skin contamination). Additionally, perform PCR amplifications with no template control reactions in parallel to ensure that the PCR reagents and reactions have not been contaminated. If a band appears in a no template control, discard the reagents and repeat the amplification with fresh reagents. Taking these precautions will ensure successful sequencing of the bacteria of interest.</p><p>The PCR amplification step tends to require the most troubleshooting. Amplifying in sets of twelve samples provides a balance between efficiency and consistency. The complete absence of bands across all samples in a given amplification set indicates a systematic failure, <italic>e.g., </italic>forgetting to add a reagent or incorrectly programming the thermocycler. The absence of a band from a few samples is usually due to human error, and the amplifications should be re-run with the same pairing of sample and reverse primer. In the case of continued absence of a band, the sample can be re-amplified using a reverse primer with a different barcode. Repeated amplification failures with multiple reverse primers may indicate an inhibitor present in the sample. In that case, cleaning the DNA with a column will often remove inhibitors without significantly altering relative bacterial abundances. If multiple bands result after amplification, re-amplify the sample with a different reverse primer barcode.</p><p>In addition to preventing environmental contamination and ensuring amplification of a single specific product, successful sequencing relies on care when preparing the library pool. The goal is to combine equimolar amounts of each sample's amplicons to ensure approximately the same number of sequencing reads per sample. If the nucleic acid concentrations prior to amplification are comparable, simply adding equal volumes of each sample's amplicons is sufficient when creating the library pool. However, if the nucleic acid concentrations are vastly different and added in equal volume, the sample with the low nucleic acid concentration will be poorly represented with a low number of reads. In this case, it is possible to add a higher volume of the amplicons from the low concentration sample based upon the relative intensity of the gel band. Alternatively, it is possible to more rigorously remove primers from the individual amplicons, quantify individual sample's amplicon concentration using a fluorometric dsDNA quantification kit, and precisely combine equimolar amounts of each sample.</p><p>Once a well-balanced amplicon pool is generated, it becomes critical to carefully measure the pool's concentration. Subsequent careful dilution and spike-in with PhiX to increase the read complexity is critical for achieving optimal sequencing results. High-throughput sequencers that use sequencing by synthesis are very sensitive to the cluster density on the flow cell. Loading a library pool that is too concentrated will result in overclustering, with lower quality scores, lower data output, and inaccurate demultiplexing<sup>32</sup>. Loading a library pool that is too dilute will also result in low data output. Carefully quantifying the library pool prior to sequencing will ensure optimal results.</p><p>16S rRNA gene sequencing provides a comprehensive assessment of the bacteria present within a given sample and is an absolutely critical first step in hypothesis generation. The presence of a rich set of metadata further enables the researcher to test associations between particular bacterial species and important biological factors. Furthermore, the same 16S information can be used to infer the bacterial functions using with tools such as PICRUSt<sup>33</sup>. The ultimate goal is to use 16S characterization to identify novel associations that can be further tested and validated in model systems, adding to our growing understanding of the impact of the bacterial microbiome on human health and disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosures</title><p>The authors have nothing to disclose.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Elizabeth Byrne, David Gootenberg, and Christina Gosmann for critical feedback on the protocol; Megan Baldridge, Scott Handley, Cindy Monaco, and Jason Norman for sample preparation guidance and demonstrations; Wendy Garrett, Curtis Huttenhower, Skip Virgin, and Bruce Walker for protocol advice and fruitful discussions; and Jessica Hoisington-Lopez for sequencing support.
