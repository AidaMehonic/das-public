In contrast to gene transcripts, where &#x0223c;25% correlated with growth rate irrespective of the nature of the limiting nutrient, metabolite concentrations were highly sensitive to the limiting nutrient's identity. Nitrogen (ammonium) and carbon (glucose) limitation were characterized by low intracellular amino acid and high nucleotide levels, whereas phosphorus (phosphate) limitation resulted in the converse. Low adenylate energy charge was found selectively in phosphorus limitation, suggesting the energy charge may actually measure phosphorus availability. Particularly strong concentration responses occurred in metabolites closely linked to the limiting nutrient, e.g., glutamine in nitrogen limitation, ATP in phosphorus limitation, and pyruvate in carbon limitation. A simple but physically realistic model involving the availability of these metabolites was adequate to account for cellular growth rate.

When nutrient availability falls to the point of impairing biosynthetic activity, microorganisms respond by decreasing their growth rate. For a nutrient-limited culture, the steady-state growth rate (&#x003bc;) is a monotonic, saturable function of the extracellular concentration of the limiting nutrient ([S]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Monod 1942</xref>), i.e.,
<disp-formula id="FD1"><graphic xlink:href="zmk00110-9313-m01"/></disp-formula> where K<sub>s</sub> is the saturation constant. This relationship is best studied in chemostats, where &#x003bc; can be controlled experimentally by changing the culture's dilution rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Monod 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Novick and Szilard 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Beck and von Meyenburg, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Rhee 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Senn <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). In the chemostat, in addition to &#x0201c;natural nutrients&#x0201d; (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, or phosphorus), cells also can be limited for nutrients made essential by mutations (e.g., uracil in a pyrimidine auxotroph).</p><p>The ability of cells to tailor their growth rate to a wide diversity of limiting nutrients&#x02014;including auxotrophic requirements&#x02014;raises the question of how cells sense nutrient availability to &#x0201c;know&#x0201d; the rate at which they can grow. Although extracellular nutrients can be sensed by receptors at the cell surface, this does not explain how cells are able to tailor their growth rate to &#x0201c;non-natural&#x0201d; nutrients required only due to mutations in biosynthetic pathways. An alternate mechanism involves sensing the extracellular nutrient based on intracellular metabolite(s). Such an approach is consistent with the ability of yeast to adjust their growth rate to both natural and auxotrophic nutrient limitations. For example, in a pyrimidine auxotroph, limitation for extracellular uracil could result in depletion of cellular UTP and CTP and thereby reduced RNA biosynthesis and slower growth.</p><p>Baker's yeast, as the best-studied eukaryotic microbe, provides a valuable system for investigating the pathways linking nutrient environment to growth rate. Recent studies have examined the transcriptome (and to a limited extent, the proteome and secreted metabolites) of nutrient-limited yeast cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Gasch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Boer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Kolkman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Castrillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Brauer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Pir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This research has revealed close ties between the transcriptome and growth rate. Expression of more than a quarter of genes in yeast depends strongly on growth rate, in a manner insensitive to which nutrient limits growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Brauer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The mechanisms linking the nutrient environment to transcription and growth rate, however, have remained unclear.</p><p>To investigate such mechanisms, here we use liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure the intracellular metabolome of yeast limited for five different nutrients (glucose as the sole carbon source, ammonium as the sole nitrogen source, phosphate as the sole phosphorus source, uracil, and leucine), with each limiting nutrient tested at five different growth rates. The experimental design and the physiological circumstances in the chemostats parallel those in which the transcript measurements had been made previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Brauer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with its close link to the nutrient environment, we find that the intracellular metabolome varies greatly depending on the identity of the limiting nutrient and the severity of nutrient limitation. Unlike gene transcripts, there are only a limited number of metabolites whose abundance shows a correlation with growth rate independent of the limiting external nutrient. Different limiting nutrients cause the intracellular concentrations of distinct classes of metabolites to decrease. Nitrogen limitation is associated with low intracellular levels of amino acids, especially glutamine and its products. Phosphorus limitation is associated with low levels of a broad spectrum of phosphorylated compounds, including ATP. Strikingly, phosphorus limitation produces a much lower &#x0201c;adenylate energy charge&#x0201d; than carbon (glucose) limitation. Thus, energy charge also measures &#x0201c;phosphorus charge.&#x0201d;</p><p>To begin to quantitatively define possible pathways linking nutrient availability to growth, we develop statistical criteria for metabolites that may potentially serve as intracellular species limiting growth. We show that metabolites meeting these criteria include glutamine for nitrogen limitation, ATP for phosphorus limitation, pyruvate for carbon (glucose) limitation, and UTP for uracil limitation. We further develop a simple steady-state model in which growth rate depends on the availability of these four intracellular compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and Cultivation</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> was cultivated in chemostats using five different limiting nutrients, each at five different dilution rates (&#x0223c;0.05, 0.11, 0.16, 0.22 and 0.30 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="zmk00110-9313-m02"/></disp-formula> Cell count per milliliter and mean cell volume were determined based on electrical impedance by Coulter counter (for measurements, see Supplemental Table S3). Cell counts are reported in units of 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml; mean cell volume is reported in picoliters.

After normalization, absent values (where no peak was detected) and normalized ion counts below 300 were set to 300 to remove variation in compounds that were near the limit of detection. The selection of 300 normalized ion counts as a floor value is based on the lower limit of quantitation typically being &#x0223c;100 ion counts and the smallest normalization factor being 0.38. Normalized ion counts for each metabolite in every sample are provided in Supplemental Dataset 2.</p><p>Normalized ion counts were then converted to relative concentrations by dividing the value for the experimental samples by the corresponding value from the phosphorus-limited reference chemostat (matched for date of analysis and methanol quenching or vacuum filtration):
<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="zmk00110-9313-m03"/></disp-formula> Because each experimental chemostat was sampled four times, and each experimental sample was paired to two independent phosphorus-limited reference samples, this gave eight values for each condition.

These compounds include most central carbon metabolites, amino acids, and nucleotides.</p><p>Intracellular metabolites were extracted from chemostat cultures using two methods. One involved mixing culture medium containing cells directly into cold methanol, followed by isolation of the cells by centrifugation and subsequent extraction of the cell pellet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">de Koning and van Dam 1992</xref>). The other involved isolation of the cells by vacuum filtration followed by quenching and extraction of the filter-trapped cells. In both methods, acetonitrile:methanol:water (40:40:20) was used as the extraction solvent, as for most compounds it gave equal or greater yields to methanol:water (the previous literature standard; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Maharjan and Ferenci 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Villas-B&#x000f4;as <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In particular, acetonitrile:methanol:water was substantially more effective at extracting nucleotides from filter-trapped cells (Supplemental Figure S1A and Supplemental Table S2). Although the filtration method gave larger absolute signals for nucleotide triphosphates (Supplemental Figure S1B), relative metabolite concentration changes across biological samples (i.e., mass spectrometry signals normalized to the volume of the extracted cells and then to the geometric mean across all chemostat conditions) were robust to the sampling method (Supplemental Figure S2). Because both methods gave comparable relative quantitation, the data were pooled in all subsequent analysis. A complete summary of the pooled data, expressed as log<sub>2</sub> ratios of the relative metabolite concentration changes, is provided in Supplemental Dataset 1. Similar data clustering and quantitative conclusions are obtained from independent analysis of either the methanol-quenched cells or the vacuum-filtered cells.</p><sec><title>Whole Metabolome View</title><p>We used hierarchical clustering (Pearson correlation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Eisen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) of the metabolites to view the relative differences and similarities in metabolite concentrations among conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, for alternative color scheme see Supplemental Figure S2). This display suggests several general conclusions. First, metabolites belonging to the same class, such as pyrimidine intermediates, amino acids, or tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle intermediates, formed remarkably consistent clusters. Second, the levels of almost all metabolites depended strongly on the identity of the limiting nutrient, with profound differences across conditions that for several compounds even exceeded 100-fold. Third, the differences between nutrients were most pronounced at the slowest growth rate, at which the limitation was most stringent.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Clustered heat map of yeast metabolome variation as a function of growth rate and identity of the limiting nutrient.

Generally, the compounds that showed the strongest growth rate effect were directly related to the limiting nutrient. For example, most amino acids were depleted in nitrogen limitation, especially at slow growth rates, and rose with increasing growth rate. Similarly, nucleotide triphosphates were depleted in phosphorus limitation and rose with faster growth rate. The inverse was true for nitrogenous bases and nucleosides, whose concentrations were elevated in phosphorus limitation and declined with faster growth rate. The general trend toward amino acid depletion in nitrogen limitation and nucleotide triphosphate depletion in phosphorus limitation is consistent with previous literature showing that nitrogen limitation restricts protein synthesis and that phosphorus limitation restricts nucleic acid synthesis in <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Cooney and Wang 1976</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of Growth-limiting Intracellular Metabolites</title><p>As a prelude to searching for intracellular metabolites that might limit growth, we confirmed that the growth rate was related to the extracellular concentration of the limiting nutrient. As expected, growth rate was a monotonic function of the concentration of the limiting nutrient, as shown for glucose, uracil, and leucine limitation in Supplemental Figure S3. The estimated values for &#x003bc;<sub>max</sub> (Supplemental Figure S3), derived from the Michaelis&#x02013;Menten relationship (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Eq. 1</xref>), approximate the empirically observed maximum growth rate in exponential batch culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Pronk 2002</xref>).</p><p>For depletion of an intracellular metabolite to limit growth, we reasoned that its concentration must 1) be uniquely low in the nutrient condition where it is growth-limiting; and 2) within that condition, rise when the limitation is partially relieved, i.e., with increasing growth rate. In each limitation regime, we identified several metabolites that qualitatively met these criteria. Some examples include glutamine, a central nitrogen assimilation metabolite, in nitrogen limitation; ATP, the free energy currency and RNA building block, in phosphorus limitation; pyruvate, the glycolytic end product, in carbon (glucose) limitation; and UTP, the RNA building block, in uracil limitation. These four examples are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. In each case, there is a well-understood connection between the limiting nutrient and the potentially growth-limiting intracellular metabolite.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Examples of metabolites that are potentially limiting growth under glucose limitation, ammonium limitation, phosphate limitation, and uracil limitation (from top to bottom).

The data for each metabolite&#x02013;nutrient condition pair were fit to the following simple model:
<disp-formula id="FD2"><graphic xlink:href="zmk00110-9313-m05"/></disp-formula> where [M]<sub>n,&#x003bc;</sub> is the metabolite's concentration in yeast growing at rate &#x003bc; with limiting nutrient n, [M]<sub>0</sub> is the geometric mean concentration of the metabolite across all conditions, &#x003bc; is the growth rate, &#x003bc;<sub>0</sub> is the geometric mean growth rate, and m<sub>n</sub> and b<sub>n</sub> are model parameters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> for an illustration of the model). The parameter b<sub>n</sub> (the &#x0201c;nutrient mean effect&#x0201d;) captures whether limitation for nutrient n generally enhances or depletes the metabolite M. The parameter m<sub>n</sub> (the &#x0201c;growth rate slope&#x0201d;) captures the effect of growth rate within that nutrient limitation, i.e., whether [M] increases or decreases when the nutrient limitation is partially relieved and growth rate rises. Although used here primarily as a statistical tool, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">Eq. 2</xref> also approximates typical functions used to relate metabolite concentrations and growth rate in cells. For example, if growth rate is a saturable function of the concentration of a limiting metabolite M as per <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Eq. 1</xref>, then the slope m<sub>n</sub> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">Eq. 2</xref> is the inverse of the Hill coefficient of the function in the growth-limited regime (see Supplemental Material derivation of this relationship).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Model-based determination of the nutrient mean effect and growth rate slope, using arginine as an example metabolite.

Units of the nutrient mean effect are log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) and of the growth rate slope are log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change)/(growth rate). For example, a nutrient mean effect of &#x02212;2 (as found for arginine in glucose limitation) implies that the average arginine concentration in glucose limitation is one-quarter (i.e., 2<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) the overall average. Once growth rate slope and nutrient mean effects are calculated, they can be plotted against each other (bottom right). Candidate growth-limiting metabolites have a negative nutrient mean effect and a positive growth rate slope, and accordingly fall in the top left quadrant. Overflow metabolites have a positive nutrient mean effect and negative growth rate slope, and accordingly fall in the bottom right quadrant. Compound-nutrient pairs are plotted when the nutrient mean effect and growth rate slope are both significant at FDR &#x0003c;0.1.

Such metabolites are found in the upper left quadrant of the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, with roughly 10 candidates found per natural limitation. In contrast, for uracil limitation, we found only three candidates, two of which were UTP and CTP, the biopolymer precursors most directly linked to pyrimidine auxotrophy (Supplemental Figure S4). The identification of UTP and CTP in uracil limitation supports the validity of the analytical method. For leucine limitation, the analysis was less informative, as we were unable to resolve leucine from its structural isomer, isoleucine, in the present LC-MS/MS method.</p><p>In addition to identifying candidate growth-limiting metabolites, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">Eq. 2</xref> also identified compounds that increase in response to limitation for a particular nutrient. Such &#x0201c;overflow metabolites&#x0201d; are characterized by a positive nutrient mean effect and negative growth rate slope and are found in the lower right quadrant of the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. Although somewhat fewer &#x0201c;overflow&#x0201d; than &#x0201c;growth-limiting&#x0201d; species were found, those identified tended to be clearly related to the nutrient limitation and often lacked the limiting element, e.g., nucleosides and nitrogenous bases in phosphorus limitation.</p><p>It should be noted that the nutrient mean effect term of the linear model can be skewed by metabolites that are extreme in one condition. For example, pyrimidine intermediates accumulated so greatly in the uracil auxotroph that their concentrations in all other conditions were significantly below the overall mean, i.e., a strong positive nutrient mean effect in uracil limitation resulted in the &#x0201c;artifactual&#x0201d; appearance of a negative nutrient mean effect in the other conditions. To avoid such skewing due to the auxotrophs, we repeated the above-mentioned analyses using only data for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus limitation (the natural limitations). With the exception of pyrimidine intermediates (which are omitted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> on this basis), the results were qualitatively the same; however, due to smaller dataset size, statistical significance of some effects was reduced. For plots using only the natural limitation data, see Supplemental Figure S5 or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://growthrate.princeton.edu/metabolome/">http://growthrate.princeton.edu/metabolome/</ext-link>.</p><p>As one approach to identify particularly interesting potential growth-limiting metabolites, for each nutrient limitation, we ordered the metabolites by statistical significance, first considering only the nutrient mean effect and then considering only the growth rate slope. Metabolites were then prioritized based on the sum of their ranks in these two dimensions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This prioritization, based on statistical significance, favors metabolites that both fit the model closely and have strong nutrient mean effects and growth rate slopes. For example, in carbon (glucose) limitation, although arginine has the strongest nutrient mean effect and growth rate slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), pyruvate better fits the model, rising more steadily with increasing growth rate (compare carbon limitation data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and accordingly rises to the top of <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Candidate growth-limiting metabolites under carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, leucine, and uracil limitation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Limiting nutrient</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Name</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">b<sub>n</sub> p value</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">m<sub>n</sub> p value</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rank sum</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glucose</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pyruvate</td><td align="char" char="&#x000d7;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 &#x000d7;

Between ATP, UTP, and CTP, genetic evidence points to ATP being the most likely intracellular signal of phosphate status: two enzymes of ATP metabolism, adenylate kinase and adenosine kinase, negatively regulate the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Auesukaree <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Huang and O'Shea 2005</xref>). One of these, adenylate kinase, catalyzes the conversion of two ADP molecules into ATP and AMP and thus serves to maintain cellular ATP levels.</p><p>During phosphorus limitation, when ATP was strongly decreased, ADP fell only slightly and AMP accumulated. Adenylate energy charge (AEC), defined as follows:
<disp-formula id="FD3"><graphic xlink:href="zmk00110-9313-m06"/></disp-formula> strongly fell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). It is unclear, however, whether the cells were actually energy limited, as the free energy of ATP hydrolysis differs from adenylate energy charge in being sensitive to the concentration of free P<sub>i</sub> but not [AMP]:
<disp-formula id="FD4"><graphic xlink:href="zmk00110-9313-m07"/></disp-formula> As the concentration of free phosphate in the cell is presumably very low during phosphorus limitation, it is likely that the cells maintained a relatively constant free energy of ATP hydrolysis despite their putative low adenylate energy charge. In contrast, during carbon (glucose) limitation, where energy availability might be expected to limit growth, adenylate energy charge remained high. Other stimuli that block energy production, however, such as sudden shift of respiring yeast to anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Abbott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), or iron depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Thomas and Dawson 1977</xref>), do alter energy charge. Accordingly, although &#x0201c;adenylate energy charge&#x0201d; indeed sometimes reflects energy-generating capabilities, it is also a measure of phosphorus charge.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Adenylate energy charge across conditions and growth rates.

Similar results have previously been obtained in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> fed different carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Schneider and Gourse 2004</xref>). Moreover, in yeast, acute relief of glucose limitation depletes, rather than increases, ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Somsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Thus, we suggest that, at least under aerobic conditions, glucose limitation leads to intracellular limitation for carbon, not energy.</p><p>In addition to signaling nitrogen limitation, depletion of amino acids is a possible reflection of carbon limitation. Two amino acids, threonine and arginine, showed a growth-limiting pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), with threonine more sensitive to carbon than nitrogen availability. Histidine, although just missing the statistical cut-off for being growth limiting in glucose, showed a similar pattern to arginine, and these two amino acids cluster tightly together in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Interestingly, histidine biosynthesis is intertwined with purine biosynthesis, whereas arginine is intertwined with that of pyrimidines. It is accordingly possible that the depletion of these amino acids during nitrogen and carbon limitation plays a role in maintaining nucleotide pools when either carbon or nitrogen is scarce (e.g., by leading to impairment of protein synthesis and thereby decreased RNA synthesis).</p><p>Other metabolites showing a growth-limiting pattern in carbon (glucose) limitation included dihydroxyacetone phosphate and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate, both of which were also low in phosphorus limitation. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate is a key glycolytic intermediate. N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate is a precursor to UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-glucosamine, a substrate in protein glycosylation and chitin biosynthesis. Although UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-glucosamine did not show a growth-limiting pattern, the identification of such a pattern in <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate is intriguing, as a closely related pathway in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> was recently implicated in nutrient control of cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Weart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Moreover, chitin localizes to the yeast bud, a location especially relevant to cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Cabib and Bowers 1971</xref>).</p><p>Pyruvate, which topped the list of potential intracellular indicators of glucose limitation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), was more specifically depleted in glucose limitation. Although pyruvate is not a direct biopolymer precursor, it does play a critical role in setting the balance between fermentation and respiration. Pyruvate dehydrogenase, which leads to acetyl-CoA and respiration, has a higher affinity for pyruvate than pyruvate decarboxylase, which leads to fermentative ethanol production. Low concentrations of pyruvate therefore favor respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Kresze and Ronft 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Postma <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Nalecz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Pronk <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Consistent with this, the glucose-limited cultures at low dilution rates, where no ethanol was produced (Supplemental Figure S6), had the lowest pyruvate concentrations across all conditions. In contrast, the fastest growing of the glucose-limited chemostats, where ethanol secretion occurred, had substantially higher pyruvate. The switch from respiratory to respiro-fermentative growth was accompanied by a sharp drop in biomass, as expected based on previous literature (Supplemental Figure S7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Barford and Hall 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Avigad 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Postma <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Moore <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Goncalves <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>A Simple Quantitative Model of Growth Control</title><p>The above-mentioned analysis identified intracellular metabolites whose depletion might hinder cellular growth during nutrient limitation. A simplified model for this process involves envisioning growth as the assembly of these critical metabolites into biopolymer. The rate of growth could then be approximated as a maximum rate, which decreases whenever any of the critical components is scarce:
<disp-formula id="FD5"><graphic xlink:href="zmk00110-9313-m08"/></disp-formula> where &#x003bc; is the growth rate, &#x003bc;<sub>max</sub> the maximum growth rate in the absence of nutrient limitation, <italic>x<sub>n</sub></italic> the concentrations of the limiting intracellular metabolite associated with nutrient limitation <italic>n</italic>, and <italic>k<sub>n</sub></italic> the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for <italic>x<sub>n</sub></italic>. To test this model, we selected pyruvate, glutamine, ATP, and UTP as the putative limiting intracellular metabolites in carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and uracil (U) limitation, respectively. These selections are based on the particularly significant depletion of these species in the relevant nutrient condition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), their clear connection to the limiting nutrient, and their involvement (with the exception of pyruvate) in RNA or protein synthesis. The model did not consider leucine limitation, as leucine was not differentiated from isoleucine in our analyses. The model, using data from only four metabolites, fit the experimental data well (cross-validated R<sup>2</sup> of 0.75, p = 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>). Importantly, this good fit did not require selective sensing of specific metabolites in particular nutrient conditions, but the more physically realistic case where all potential limiting species interact to control growth rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Overflow Metabolites</title><p>Although not candidates to limit growth, metabolites that accumulate during nutrient limitation are also informative regarding metabolic regulation. Early evidence for feedback inhibition in metabolic regulation came from the observation that pyrimidine intermediates accumulate during uracil limitation of a pyrimidine auxotroph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Pardee and Yates 1956</xref>). Here, we recapitulate this finding, with dihydroorotate and orotate levels highest in severely pyrimidine-limited cells. It is possible that these high intermediate levels, not just decreased levels of end products, may adversely impact growth rate.</p><p>In leucine limitation, although we did not measure any pathway intermediates, we found a large number of other metabolites whose levels were elevated, including most amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). When growth is slowed due to an auxotrophic limitation, if feedback inhibition is the main means of regulation, all metabolic end products unrelated to the auxotrophy are expected to accumulate. Quantitative analysis (see Supplemental Material) suggests that the concentrations of these end products should be a function of growth rate but independent of the nature of the auxotrophy (as long as the auxotrophy is in a pathway separate from that producing the end product). Experimentally, however, amino acids accumulate much more strongly in leucine versus uracil limitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), pointing to the importance of other modes of regulation, e.g., general up-regulation of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes in leucine limitation due to Gcn4p activation (discussed below). In addition to amino acids, compounds accumulating in leucine limitation included phenylpyruvate, choline, glycerate, and pyruvate. The accumulation of pyruvate is consistent with the wasting of glucose that occurs when yeast are limited for an auxotrophic requirement but not for an elemental nutrient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Brauer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In addition, pyruvate provides the carbon skeleton for leucine biosynthesis.</p><p>In natural limitations, lack of availability of substrates (e.g., glutamine in nitrogen limitation, ATP in phosphorus limitation) may impair biosynthesis. Accordingly, overflow of end products was not predicted, and it did not generally occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In nitrogen limitation, metabolites instead accumulated in the part of the TCA cycle directly upstream of ammonium assimilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The accumulation of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate presumably underlies similar accumulation of phenylpyruvate, which is linked to &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate by transamination. In nitrogen limitation, trehalose (which rose in concentration during slow growth in every nutrient condition) was present at particularly high levels. This may reflect cellular efforts to store carbon when growth is nitrogen limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Lillie and Pringle 1980</xref>), or to compensate for decreased osmotic pressure when amino acid concentrations fall.</p><p>In phosphorus limitation, a large number of nucleosides and nitrogenous bases were found to overflow. These compounds are not involved in de novo nucleotide biosynthesis but instead are generated when phosphate moieties are scavenged from nucleotide monophosphates, e.g., via adenosine kinase, whose knockout favors activation of the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Auesukaree <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Huang and O'Shea 2005</xref>). The overflow also of pyrimidine nucleosides and bases argues that, in addition to its annotated activity as a pyrimidine salvage enzyme, uridine kinase can function as a phosphate scavenge enzyme. Interestingly, glycerate and choline, two compounds that overflowed for unknown reasons during leucine limitation, also did so during phosphorus limitation. One possibility is that the overflow of choline (and possibly glycerate) indicates increased recycling of phospholipids: phosphatidylcholine can be deacylated by <italic>NTE1</italic>, yielding glycerophosphocholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Zaccheo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), which can subsequently be used by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a phosphate source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Fern&#x000e1;ndez-Murray and McMaster, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although essentially all cellular metabolites contain carbon, glucose limitation nevertheless resulted in the significant accumulation (i.e., positive nutrient mean effect) of certain species: mainly, multiply phosphorylated nucleotides such as triphosphates, UDP-glucose, and NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Among these, the abundance of NAD<sup>+</sup> also significantly decreased with faster growth, meeting our criteria for overflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). The accumulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> when glucose is low may favor efficient respiration. In addition to nucleotide derivatives, glutamate, and its downstream product, proline, tended to rise in glucose limitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). The accumulation of glutamate and proline was surprising, given that most amino acids levels were decreased in carbon limitation. It is possible that elevated glutamate in severely glucose-limited cells reflects an overabundance of nitrogen relative to carbon, which in turn may drive the reductive amination of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate.</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolites Correlated to Growth Rate across Different Nutrients</title><p>Although the concentrations of most metabolites were highly dependent on the limiting nutrient, some metabolites did show a general trend to increase or decrease with growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).

Similarly, the concentrations of pyrimidine intermediates may relate to de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic flux, argininosuccinate to de novo arginine biosynthesis, and ribose phosphate to overall nucleotide biosynthetic activity. In each case, the higher intermediate concentrations may play a role in driving flux: for unsaturated enzymes, flux increases linearly with increasing metabolite concentrations. Thus, increasing concentrations of pyrimidine intermediates could drive biosynthesis without requiring increased synthesis of the corresponding enzymes. As we measured only a few biosynthetic intermediates outside of the pyrimidine pathway, other pathway intermediates may also increase with growth rate in a nutrient-nonspecific manner.</p><p>Only two metabolites showed a statistically significant trend to decrease with faster growth rate: trehalose and glutathione disulfide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) (the reduced form of glutathione also displayed a similar trend, with a Bonferroni&#x02013;Holm corrected p value of 0.12.) Both trehalose and glutathione are produced by enzymes that are targets of the Msn2p and Msn4p transcription factors, whose activities increase with slower cell growth. Of these two metabolites, trehalose concentrations were most tightly correlated to growth rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This observation is consistent with trehalose biosynthesis and utilization being temporally compartmentalized within the cell cycle, with synthesis occurring in G1 and use in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Kuenzi and Fiechter 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Paalman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Tu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">2007</xref>).

The accumulation of trehalose during the G1 phase may contribute to cell cycle control, with burning of trehalose helping to drive nutrient-limited cells through &#x0201c;Start&#x0201d;, the entry point of the yeast cell division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Futcher 2006</xref>). A possible benefit of this arrangement would be that cells would pass Start only when adequate internal carbon sources were available to make it back to G1, thereby protecting cells from being stranded in the cell cycle if environmental nutrient availability were to dry up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Previously, it was observed that transcripts up-regulated with faster growth tended to be involved in biosynthesis and protein translation, whereas down-regulated transcripts were enriched for genes that play a role in the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Brauer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).

This induction of amino acid biosynthesis pathways under leucine limitation, when ample carbon and nitrogen were available, presumably accounts for the rampant amino acid accumulation in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In phosphorus limitation, one of the most striking transcriptional patterns was, intriguingly, not directly related to phosphate metabolism, but instead to sulfate. <italic>SUL1</italic>, <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>MHT1</italic>, <italic>CYS3</italic>, <italic>MUP1</italic>, and <italic>SAM1</italic> were strongly repressed by phosphorus limitation, with <italic>SUL1</italic> in phosphorus limitation showing the most positive growth rate slope of any gene in any condition. This suggests a strong relationship between phosphate limitation and sulfur metabolism. The repression of the high-affinity sulfate permease <italic>SUL1</italic> when phosphate is scarce (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Tai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), is probably a consequence of nonspecific sulfate transport through the highly expressed phosphate transporters. Nonspecific transport has been described previously for ammonium through potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Hess <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), where uncontrolled ammonium influx led the yeast to excrete amino acids in an effort to detoxify ammonia. Consistent with cells needing to decrease the intracellular concentration of free sulfate, in phosphorus limitation we observe modestly higher methionine and glutathione concentrations. Interestingly, clones isolated after prolonged phosphate limitation often display increased expression of sulfur assimilation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Gresham <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This would suggest that high intracellular sulfate (or a high intracellular ratio of sulfate to phosphate), resulting from the increased sulfate influx through phosphate transporters, is detrimental to yeast, which evolve the ability to more rapidly assimilate sulfate to deal with this toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Divergent Metabolome, Homeostatic Transcriptome</title><p>A striking feature of the metabolome response was the magnitude of the concentration changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This partial breakdown of homeostasis is perhaps not unexpected, given the relatively direct connection of metabolites to environmental nutrients. Environmental nutrient concentrations are outside the realm of cellular control, and in our experiments, extracellular glucose concentrations varied from 0.1 to 118 mM across different chemostats, corresponding to an &#x0223c;1000-fold range, whereas leucine (in leucine-limited cells) and uracil (in uracil-limited cells) varied over a more modest, but still large range (&#x0223c;40-fold) (Supplemental Table S3). The median metabolite concentration also varied over a large range (14-fold) but not as large as the nutrients. In contrast, the median transcript varied over a substantially smaller range (3.2-fold), comparable with the experimental range of growth rates (5.5-fold). Thus, cellular regulatory systems partially dampen environmental variability at the level of the metabolome, and more strongly at the level of the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Dynamic range of extracellular and intracellular small molecules, transcripts, and cellular growth rate. Dynamic range refers to the maximum fold-change across all experiments. Reported values for nutrients, metabolites, and transcripts are the median across all measured species. For nutrients, the measured species are glucose (across all conditions), leucine (in leucine limitation), and uracil (in uracil limitation). Note that transcripts were measured by microarray; measurement by sequencing might yield a larger dynamic range.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zmk0011093130008"/></fig><p>For metabolic enzymes, a key objective of transcriptional regulation is to control, via enzyme concentrations, metabolic flux. Although we did not measure metabolic flux here, in the absence of futile cycling, many fluxes are expected to scale linearly with growth rate. In this light, it is sensible that the experimental range of transcripts and growth rate are similar. Nevertheless, in preliminary efforts to relate enzyme expression to growth rate, we find many complexities. For example, enzymes catalyzing different steps in linear biosynthetic pathways sometimes show opposing patterns of regulation. These observations point to the importance of other modes of metabolic regulation, such as active site competition, allostery, and enzyme covalent modification, which require further dissection (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Yuan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In such efforts, the existence of a consensus reconstruction of yeast metabolism will provide a valuable roadmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Herrg&#x000e5;rd <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Another important question is how regulatory systems ultimately link the metabolome to growth rate and the transcriptome. The most straightforward possibility is that metabolite availability directly controls growth rate by limiting the availability of substrates for biomass synthesis. Such a view is consistent with the ability of cells to tailor their growth rate to auxotrophic requirements, and with our ability to model growth rate using a simple Michaelis-Menten approach based on a few limiting nutrients. Hence an appealing possibility is that the expression of transcripts showing generic growth rate effects is regulated downstream of growth rate, rather than solely via integration of signals from various nutrient-specific sensing pathways, including Ras/protein kinase A for glucose, TOR complex 1 for nitrogen and Pho80/Pho85 for phosphate (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Zaman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This possibility would account for the similarity between the transcriptional responses to auxotrophic and to natural nutrient limitations, even when no system for sensing the auxotrophic limitation exists. One potential means by which transcription could be directly controlled by growth rate involves steady production of a transcriptional activator or repressor (at a rate independent of growth rate), with the intracellular concentration of that activator or repressor controlled by dilution by cell growth. Another possibility is that the total rates of protein and/or RNA synthesis might be sensed by the cell.</p><p>In addition to the nature of the mechanism linking the metabolome to the transcriptome, the precise pathway by which nutrient limitation controls growth also requires further investigation. One issue is whether the limiting intracellular metabolites actually fall to levels that directly limit biosynthesis, or instead just to levels that alter the activity of nutrient-sensing systems such as TOR. Another issue is that each elemental nutrient limitation resulted in decreases in the concentrations of multiple possible growth-limiting metabolites. This observation contrasts with a theoretical expectation that only a single metabolite should be growth limiting at any instant, as, even if the production of many metabolites is slowed by insufficient nutrient concentrations, only the one whose production is impaired the most will be limiting (Wingreen and Goyal, personal communication). Even though many species fall in concentration in each elemental nutrient limitation, it is possible that only a single species actually falls to limiting levels (e.g., in nitrogen limitation, glutamine might be growth limiting, with the fall in histidine, arginine, and other amino acids essentially incidental). More complex scenarios are also possible, however. One involves the limiting species varying between cells depending on inter-cell variation in enzyme expression. To this end, single-cell measurement of specific metabolite concentrations over time would be a valuable advance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Deuschle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Combined with genetic perturbations and direct measurement of tRNA loading, such experiments hold the promise to assemble the candidate limiting metabolites found here into well-validated growth-control pathways.</p></sec></sec>
