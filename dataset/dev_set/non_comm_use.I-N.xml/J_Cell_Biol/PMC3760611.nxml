Using an optical trap for spatial and temporal control over target presentation, we show that centrosome repositioning in Jurkat T cells exhibited kinetically distinct polarization and docking phases and required calcium flux and signaling through both the T cell receptor and integrin to be robust.

In agreement with this mechanism, centrosome repositioning was impaired by inhibiting microtubule depolymerization or dynein.

Central to a few well-studied examples is the presence in the cell cortex of the microtubule minus end&#x02013;directed motor cytoplasmic dynein, which repositions the centrosome/spindle pole by pulling on a subset of interphase/astral microtubules that contact the cortex. Pulling can occur via either of two mechanisms. In the cortical sliding mechanism, dynein&#x02019;s efforts to walk to the minus end of the microtubule at the centrosome while simultaneously being held in place at the cortex results in the microtubule sliding past dynein so as to reel the centrosome in. The best example of this mechanism is in budding yeast during anaphase, where dynein anchored in the bud cortex pulls the nucleus/mitotic spindle into the mother-bud neck by pulling on astral microtubules emanating from the budward-directed spindle pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moore and Cooper, 2010</xref>). In the second mechanism, cortically bound dynein interacts with the plus end of a microtubule in end-on fashion in such a way as to couple the subsequent depolymerization of the microtubule with the movement of the centrosome toward the cortex. This capture-shrinkage mechanism, which likely harnesses both dynein&#x02019;s power stroke and the force of microtubule depolymerization to drive centrosome repositioning, has been demonstrated recently in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Laan et al., 2012</xref>), and probably drives asymmetric spindle positioning in single-cell <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>). This mechanism may also facilitate spindle pole body positioning in budding yeast before mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ten Hoopen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A dramatic example of centrosome positioning in vertebrate cells occurs in T lymphocytes immediately after the recognition by the T cell of stimulatory antigen presented on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell (APC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angus and Griffiths, 2013</xref>). The principal consequence of this recognition, the focused secretion of effector molecules in the direction of the bound APC, is orchestrated by a series of rapid, synchronous, large-scale polarization events within the T cell that involve major rearrangements of its actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. These rearrangements result in the rapid formation of an organized junction between the T cell and the APC known as the immunological synapse (IS), in which the T cell&#x02019;s cortical actin cytoskeleton, adhesion molecules, and T cell receptor (TCR) microclusters are organized in radial symmetric zones facing the APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choudhuri and Dustin, 2010</xref>). At approximately the same time, the T cell&#x02019;s centrosome or microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) moves to a position that is just underneath the plasma membrane at the center of the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geiger et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kupfer et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stinchcombe et al., 2006</xref>). This rapid and robust repositioning of the T cell&#x02019;s MTOC allows the microtubule minus end&#x02013;directed transport of vesicles containing effector molecules (e.g., cytokines or lytic molecules) to be directed toward and terminated immediately adjacent to the bound APC for subsequent polarized secretion.</p><p>Previous work has shed light on several aspects of MTOC repositioning in T cells. With regard to triggering stimuli, repositioning appears to require key mediators of TCR-dependent signaling (Lck/Fyn, ZAP-70, Slp-76, and LAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lowin-Kropf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kuhn&#x000e9; et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mart&#x000ed;n-C&#x000f3;freces et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsun et al., 2011</xref>), as well as DAG-dependent activation of PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quann et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2011</xref>), but not the T cell&#x02019;s major integrin LFA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Combs et al., 2006</xref>) or the normal rise in intracellular calcium concentration that occurs upon TCR engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quann et al., 2009</xref>). As for the motive force, repositioning appears to require dynein, as the process is completely blocked by RNAi-mediated knockdown of the dynein heavy chain, as well as by overexpression of dynamitin, an inhibitor of the dynein regulator dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mart&#x000ed;n-C&#x000f3;freces et al., 2008</xref>). Consistently, a GFP-tagged dynein subunit accumulates at the IS after DAG formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quann et al., 2009</xref>), and endogenous dynein concentrates at the IS periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Combs et al., 2006</xref>; although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hashimoto-Tane et al., 2011</xref>). With regard to the underlying mechanism, the movement of the T cell&#x02019;s microtubule cytoskeleton after contact with an APC, as visualized using polarization light microscopy, together with images of fixed, end-stage T cell&#x02013;APC conjugates stained for microtubules, suggests that repositioning is driven by the cortical sliding mechanism involving dynein anchored at the IS cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kuhn and Poenie, 2002</xref>).</p><p>A major challenge in studying centrosome repositioning in T cells is that the process is extremely fast, going to completion within several minutes after APC contact. For this reason, most previous studies have used a static approach in which the T cell and APC are mixed together, incubated for 10&#x02013;30 min, fixed, and scored for the percentage of centrosomes that are close to the IS. Besides providing no dynamic information, this approach yields high levels (&#x0223c;30%) of background repositioning because T cell&#x02013;APC interaction is stochastic. One exception is the recent work from Huse and colleagues, who use the focused activation of a photo-activatable peptide&#x02013;MHC complex bound to a glass surface to provide spatial and temporal control over MTOC repositioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quann et al., 2009</xref>). This approach does, however, suffer from the fact that the engaging entity is a glass surface, which precludes IS maturation. In this study, therefore, we used an optical trap to place an APC such that its initial point of contact with the T cell is exactly opposite from the location of the T cell&#x02019;s centrosome. In this way, the complete process of MTOC repositioning within the T cell could be dynamically imaged in quantitative fashion in the context of a T cell&#x02013;APC conjugate, where IS maturation can occur. Using this and other tools, we reach different conclusions regarding several published aspects of centrosome repositioning in T cells, most notably regarding the underlying mechanism of this dynein-dependent process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Optical trap&#x02013;controlled APC presentation induces robust MTOC repositioning in Jurkat T cells</title><p>To dynamically image and quantitate the complete process of centrosome repositioning within APC-engaged Jurkat T cells, we used a simple optical trap attached to a spinning disc confocal microscope to provide both temporal and spatial control over the presentation of the APC to the T cell. Specifically, we used the trap to place a staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE)&#x02013;coated Raji B cell (the APC) adjacent to a coverslip-bound Jurkat T cell such that the Raji cell&#x02019;s initial point of contact with the surface of the T cell is exactly opposite from the position of the T cell&#x02019;s centrosome, marked by GFP-tagged centrin [cen]-2 or RFP-tagged pericentrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This method of controlling T cell engagement resulted in the rapid activation of TCR signaling, as evidenced by SEE-dependent calcium flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>), and resulted routinely in the rapid and robust repositioning of the T cell&#x02019;s MTOC to the site of contact with the Raji cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201301004/DC1" id="supp1">Video 1</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Optical trap&#x02013;based system for quantitating MTOC repositioning in Jurkat&#x02013;APC conjugates.</bold> (A) Cartoon showing the optical trap&#x02013;controlled presentation of a SEE-coated Raji cell to a centrosome-marked Jurkat T cell (A1) resulting in MTOC repositioning to the site of contact (A2).

Centrosomes that ended up &#x0003e;4 &#x000b5;m distant from the plane of contact, between 2 to 4 &#x000b5;m distant from the plane of contact, or &#x0003c;2 &#x000b5;m distant from the plane of contact were scored as &#x0201c;no repositioning&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;partial repositioning&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;full repositioning&#x0201d;, respectively. In addition, the Raji B cell sometimes repositions to the location of the Jurkat&#x02019;s MTOC (&#x0201c;APC repositioning&#x0201d;). We consider APC repositioning to be mechanistically equivalent to full repositioning. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> shows that MTOC repositioning in our trap-based assay is very robust, as 71.2% of Jurkat cells fully repositioned their MTOC after +SEE Raji engagement (WT +SEE). Including APC repositioning events in the category of full repositioning raises this value to 87.6%. Of note, partial repositioning events are very rare (4.1%), indicating that once centrosome repositioning is initiated, it almost always goes to completion. Events scored as no repositioning (8.2% of the total) are very interesting and are discussed below (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Importantly, and in striking contrast to previous static assays where T cell&#x02013;APC conjugation is stochastic, background MTOC repositioning was almost completely eliminated, as JCAM2.5 Jurkat cells, which lack the adaptor protein LAT critical for both TCR and LFA-1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choudhuri and Dustin, 2010</xref>), exhibited only 5% full repositioning events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>; JCAM2.5 +SEE).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Roles of TCR- and LFA-1-dependent signaling and calcium flux in MTOC repositioning.</bold> (A) Grading system used in the MTOC repositioning assay.

To estimate the individual contribution of TCR-dependent signaling to MTOC repositioning, we compared Jurkats conjugated to +SEE Raji cells (i.e., with TCR signaling) to Jurkats conjugated to &#x02212;SEE Raji cells (i.e., without TCR signaling). From the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> (compare WT +SEE with WT &#x02212;SEE) it is clear that although TCR signaling is required for robust MTOC repositioning, signaling through LFA-1 (and other co-stimulatory receptors) can result in measurable levels of MTOC repositioning. To estimate the individual contribution of LFA-1&#x02013;dependent signaling to MTOC repositioning, we compared wild-type (WT) Jurkats (i.e., with LFA-1 signaling) to the LFA-1&#x02013;deficient Jurkat cell line JB2.7 (i.e., without LFA-1 signaling). From the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> (compare WT +SEE with JB2.7 +SEE) it is clear that although LFA-1&#x02013;dependent signaling is required for robust MTOC repositioning, signaling through the TCR (and other co-stimulatory receptors) can result in measurable levels of MTOC repositioning. Of note, transfection of the JB2.7 cell line with GFP-LFA-1&#x003b1; largely rescued the defect in MTOC polarization (see JB2.7 +SEE +LFA-1). Finally, conjugation of JB2.7 Jurkat cells with &#x02212;SEE Raji cells (i.e., no TCR or LFA-1 signaling) resulted in the complete inhibition of APC/full repositioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, JB2.7 &#x02212;SEE). Together, these results indicate that, in contrast to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Combs et al., 2006</xref>), both TCR- and LFA-1&#x02013;dependent signaling pathways are required for robust MTOC polarization in T cells.</p><p>We also note an interesting aspect of the results using JB2.7 Jurkats, which lack LFA-1&#x02013;dependent adhesion as well as signaling. Specifically, in those repositioning events where the MTOC did undergo full repositioning, stacked images of the centrosome show that after reaching the IS it drifts away from the center of the IS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). This observation argues that tight adhesion between the T cell and the APC is required to stably position the MTOC at the center of the IS, as well as to augment its movement to the IS.</p><p>Finally, with regard to the two major consequences of PLC activation downstream of TCR ligation, it was recently reported that while the DAG-dependent activation of PKC is required for MTOC repositioning, the IP3-mediated rise in intracellular calcium is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quann et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, we observe a very significant impairment in MTOC repositioning when both intracellular and extracellular calcium are effectively chelated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>; compare WT +SEE &#x02212;Ca<sup>2+</sup> with WT +SEE).</p></sec><sec><title>MTOC repositioning is biphasic</title><p>Previous studies have concluded that MTOC repositioning in T cells occurs at a single speed (3.6 &#x000b1; 1.1 &#x000b5;m/min, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kuhn and Poenie, 2002</xref>; &#x0223c;3 &#x000b5;m/min, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quann et al., 2009</xref>). To characterize in detail the kinetics of MTOC repositioning, we labeled Jurkats with farnesylated RFP as well as with GFP-Cen-2 so that the approach of the MTOC to the plasma membrane at the IS could be gauged accurately. Typical repositioning events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201301004/DC1" id="supp3">Video 2</ext-link>) suggested that this process actually occurs in two phases: relatively fast movement of the MTOC across most of the T cell&#x02019;s volume (referred to hereafter as the polarization phase), followed by slower movement of the MTOC as it approaches the IS (the docking phase). The transition between these two phases occurred in this example when the centrosome reached a distance of &#x0223c;2 &#x000b5;m from the synaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, yellow arrowhead). Importantly, the docking phase leads to the close approximation of the centrosome to the plasma membrane at the IS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, white arrowhead), as reported previously using other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stinchcombe et al., 2006</xref>). Stack overlays of typical full repositioning events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>) reveal these two kinetic phases as an abrupt decrease in the spacing between successive centrosome spots once the centrosome gets within &#x0223c;2 &#x000b5;m of the IS (yellow arrowhead). Stack overlays also reveal a slight but reproducible change in the direction of the MTOC&#x02019;s movement relative to the plane of the IS as the MTOC transitions into the docking phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). This direction change is likely due to the fact that the MTOC must navigate around the T cell&#x02019;s nucleus, which fills much of the T cell&#x02019;s total volume, during the polarization phase, but not during the docking phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>MTOC repositioning is biphasic.</bold> (A) Time-lapse montage showing MTOC repositioning in a representative Jurkat cell immediately after APC conjugation (merged image of the GFP-Cen-2&#x02013;tagged MTOC and the RFP-Farnesyl&#x02013;tagged synaptic membrane).

To better define the two phases, their average speeds, and the transition point between them, we determined the instantaneous speed of the MTOC at every time point in all nine repositioning events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and D</xref>) and plotted the values as a function of distance from the IS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Assuming that repositioning is biphasic, we then fit the scatter plot to two clusters using cluster analysis by K means. The fitting yielded two distinct clusters with average speeds of 3.26 &#x000b1; 0.77 &#x000b5;m/min and 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.16 &#x000b5;m/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>; P &#x0003c; 0.001), which correspond to the polarization (green circles) and docking (red circles) phases, respectively, and indicated that the transition point between the two phases occurs 2.2 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x000b5;m from the IS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>; see also Materials and methods). Critically, fitting to two clusters is validated by independent evidence for the existence of the transition point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, where we find that the MTOC reproducibly stalls &#x0223c;2.4 &#x000b5;m from the IS when dynein function is attenuated.

In every such case, the MTOC appears to be &#x0201c;stuck&#x0201d; behind the nucleus, possibly because the pulling forces on the MTOC from microtubules in contact with dynein at the IS are so symmetrical that an imbalance in pulling forces required to commit to a certain path around the nucleus could not occur. To further investigate these &#x0201c;no repositioning&#x0201d; events, we marked the plasma membrane of the Raji cell with the red membrane dye PKH26.

First, they argue that even &#x0201c;no repositioning&#x0201d; events can be considered as a form of MTOC repositioning, except that in this case it is the site of contact between the two cells that repositions. Second, they suggest that the force driving MTOC repositioning can be quite strong. Third, they are completely consistent with the idea that the site of force generation driving centrosome repositioning resides at the IS, as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kuhn and Poenie, 2002</xref>). Finally, and most importantly, they argue that this force generator is focused primarily near or at the center of the IS rather than at the periphery of the IS, as argued previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kuhn and Poenie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Combs et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The organization of microtubules in Jurkat&#x02013;APC conjugates undergoing MTOC repositioning is consistent with a microtubule end-on capture-shrinkage mechanism driving repositioning</title><p>Previous studies using fixed and stained end-stage conjugates argue that dynein anchored at the periphery of the IS reels the centrosome in by pulling on the microtubule lattice, i.e., via a peripheral cortical sliding mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kuhn and Poenie, 2002</xref>). Given the results above, we decided to examine the dynamic organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton during MTOC repositioning in trap-engaged Jurkats expressing RFP-Pericentrin and 3&#x000d7;GFP-tagged EMTB to mark the T cell&#x02019;s centrosome and microtubules, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>).

Immediately after conjugation, we observed several microtubules that project from the centrosome toward the APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, inset, white arrows, 0 s frame) and that terminate in end-on fashion at the approximate center of the IS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, compare yellow arrowheads in the phase and fluorescent images). Over the next &#x0223c;30 s, these microtubules straightened and came together to form an apparent bundle of microtubules (referred to below as the microtubule &#x0201c;stalk&#x0201d;) that terminates in end-on fashion near the center of the IS (follow the white arrows in the insets). Most importantly, microtubule stalks were then observed to undergo shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>; follow the yellow arrowhead marking the point of contact of the stalk with the IS relative to the position of the yellow centrosome), causing the IS and centrosome to approach each other (in this case the IS interface came toward the centrosome). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref> shows a clear example of an event where a shortening microtubule stalk pulled the centrosome all the way to the IS (the white arrow points to the centrosome, as inferred from the EMTB signal, whereas the yellow arrowhead points to the site where the green microtubule stalk terminates at the red IS, as inferred from the signal for farnesylated RFP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201301004/DC1" id="supp12">Video 5</ext-link>). We observed such perpendicular, centrally anchored, shortening microtubule stalks coincident with MTOC repositioning in 88.5% of conjugates (<italic>n</italic> = 26).

Together, these results are consistent with MTOC repositioning being driven by a pulling force involving the end-on capture of microtubules at the approximate center of the IS, coupled with microtubule plus-end depolymerization, i.e., the capture-shrinkage mechanism, rather than with a cortical sliding mechanism involving microtubules approaching the IS at shallow angles near the edge of the IS.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Microtubule dynamics during MTOC repositioning.</bold> (A) Time-lapse images of a Jurkat&#x02013;Raji conjugate (transmitted image) in which the Jurkat has been labeled with 3&#x000d7;GFP-EMTB to mark microtubules and RFP-Pericentrin to mark the MTOC (which appears yellow) (fluorescent images).

Recently, Howard and colleagues showed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos that small membrane invaginations appear at the presumptive sites where the microtubule plus end is engaged at the cortex with the dynein-containing cortical force&#x02013;generating unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Redemann et al., 2010</xref>). These invaginations, which are presumably driven by the same force thought to pull the spindle toward the posterior of the embryo, i.e., the stepping of dynein while attached to a depolymerizing microtubule plus end, serve as an indirect readout of a focused cortical pulling force. Given their results, and our images of frustrated Jurkat&#x02013;APC conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), we asked if small invaginations at the IS can occur during normal repositioning events, and whether their position at the IS coincides with the end of the shortening microtubule stalk abutting the IS. To accomplish this, we imaged APC-conjugated Jurkats transfected with farnesylated RFP to mark the T cell&#x02019;s plasma membrane, as well as with 3&#x000d7;GFP-EMTB. One such example corresponds to the conjugate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref> discussed above, where the plasma membrane of the Jurkat cell does indeed exhibit a small invagination/indentation at the IS as the microtubule stalk undergoes shortening. Moreover, this membrane indentation coincides precisely with the site where the microtubule stalk abuts the IS. This can be seen best in the split image for the conjugate at 45 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>, see yellow arrows). Similar results were obtained when we marked the Raji cell plasma membrane with Far-Red Cellvue (see the &#x0201c;nipple-like&#x0201d; protrusion of the APC&#x02019;s plasma membrane exactly across from where the microtubule stalk in the Jurkat cell abuts the IS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>).

Therefore, if MTOC repositioning in T cells is driven by this mechanism, it should be blocked, or at least strongly impaired, by inhibiting either dynein or microtubule depolymerization. To address this, we first revisited the role of dynein in MTOC repositioning using the recently described, cell-permeant inhibitor of cytoplasmic dynein, Ciliobrevin-D, together with its inactive analogue CMP-2 as a control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>). Control experiments showed that 30 min treatment of Jurkats with 50 &#x000b5;M Ciliobrevin-D does not perturb microtubule organization, including the focusing of microtubule minus ends at the centrosome (Fig. S2 A), or microtubule plus-end dynamics (Fig. S3 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201301004/DC1" id="supp14">Table S1</ext-link>). It does, however, inhibit the dynein-dependent centering of the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes (Fig. S2 B), as well as the normal accumulation of dynein at the centrosome (Fig. S2 C). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref> shows that 50 &#x000b5;M Ciliobrevin-D results in a dramatic reduction in the frequency of full/APC repositioning events (5% of total events), as compared with untreated cells (87.6% of total events; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>) and cells treated with the inactive analogue (90% of total events; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Scoring MTOC repositioning 30 min after conjugate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>) rather than 10 min after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>) yielded a more modest inhibition, suggesting that Ciliobrevin-D decreases the speed of MTOC repositioning. Consistently, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref> shows that Ciliobrevin-D&#x02013;treated cells exhibit a 65.5% reduction in the speed of MTOC movement during the polarization phase relative to control CMP-2&#x02013;treated cells (Ciliobrevin-D, 1.10 &#x000b1; 0.16 &#x000b5;m/min; CMP-2, 3.22 &#x000b1; 0.82 &#x000b5;m/min; P &#x0003c; 0.001; calculated using only advances of one or more pixels per frame in the direction of the APC; see Materials and methods).

Specifically, while WT cells like the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref> typically exhibit a docked centrosome, the centrosome in the Ciliobrevin-D&#x02013;treated cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref> has stalled &#x0223c;2 &#x000b5;m away from the IS membrane, i.e., at the boundary between the polarization and docking phases of MTOC repositioning. This observation was supported by quantitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>), as untreated and CMP-2&#x02013;treated cells exhibit average MTOC-to-IS distances 10 min after conjugate formation of 0.66 &#x000b1; 0.30 &#x000b5;m and 0.73 &#x000b1; 0.20 &#x000b5;m, respectively, while Ciliobrevin-D&#x02013;treated cells exhibit an average MTOC-to-IS distance 30 min after conjugate formation of 2.43 &#x000b1; 0.60 &#x000b5;m (P &#x0003c; 0.001 versus both controls). Importantly, this latter distance coincides with the normal transition point between the polarization and docking phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), arguing that dynein-inhibited cells are defective in docking. That said, Ciliobrevin-D&#x02013;treated cells occasionally make transient forays past the transition point.

Importantly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, A&#x02013;G, show that in every qualitative and quantitative measure, including an essentially complete abrogation of the docking phase, these two forms of dynein inhibition phenocopied the results obtained with Ciliobrevin-D (see figure legend for details).

Importantly, 0.5 &#x000b5;M taxol did not alter microtubule organization, including the focusing of microtubule minus ends at the centrosome (Fig. S4 C), or the rate of microtubule plus-end growth (Fig. S3 A). As expected, however, it dramatically reduced the frequency of microtubule catastrophes initiated at the microtubule plus end (Table S1 A). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref> shows that whereas DMSO-treated cells exhibited robust MTOC movement after APC engagement (100% full/APC repositioning), taxol-treated cells exhibited only 39 and 50% full/APC repositioning after 10 and 30 min of APC engagement, respectively. Moreover, taxol-treated cells exhibited a 71% reduction in the speed of MTOC movement during the polarization phase relative to control DMSO-treated cells (DMSO, 3.55 &#x000b1; 0.1.27 &#x000b5;m/min; taxol, 1.03 &#x000b1; 0.33 &#x000b5;m/min; see polarization phase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>; P &#x0003c; 0.001). Of note, the magnitude of these inhibitions is quite similar to those observed in dynein-inhibited cells. That said, although dynein inhibition blocked the progression of MTOC movement through the docking phase, taxol treatment did not, as evidenced by time-lapse montages of DMSO- and taxol-treated cells such as the ones in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, D and E</xref>, respectively (docking indicated by yellow arrowhead).

These observations argue that the search and capture of microtubule plus ends at the cortex, which is driven by dynamic microtubule plus ends, is important for MTOC repositioning in Jurkat T cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we sought to define the mechanism of dynein-dependent MTOC repositioning in Jurkat T cells using optical tweezers to provide both temporal and spatial control over APC presentation. Importantly, our results challenge a number of previous conclusions regarding MTOC repositioning in T cells. First, robust MTOC repositioning requires signaling downstream from both the TCR and LFA-1 (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsun et al., 2011</xref>), not just the TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Combs et al., 2006</xref>). Our results also indicate that the normal rise in intracellular calcium concentration after TCR engagement is required for robust MTOC repositioning, in contrast to a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quann et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Second, MTOC repositioning involves two distinct kinetic phases, not one as reported previously (3.6 &#x000b1; 1.1 &#x000b5;m/min, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kuhn and Poenie, 2002</xref>; &#x0223c;3 &#x000b5;m/min, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quann et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, repositioning involves a fast (&#x0223c;3.3 &#x000b5;m/min) polarization phase and a slower (&#x0223c;0.9 &#x000b5;m/min) docking phase, with a transition between them occurring at &#x0223c;2.2 &#x000b5;m from the IS. Independent support for the existence of this transition point was provided by the observation that the MTOC reproducibly stalls &#x0223c;2.4 &#x000b5;m from the IS when dynein function is attenuated. Interestingly, Griffiths and colleagues have shown that signaling through Lck controls the progression of the partially repositioned MTOC through a docking step required for its close approach to the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsun et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Third, and most importantly, we present evidence that MTOC repositioning in T cells is driven by a microtubule end-on capture-shrinkage mechanism focused at the center of the IS rather than a cortical sliding mechanism focused at the periphery of the IS, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kuhn and Poenie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Combs et al., 2006</xref>). Four lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, the striking invagination of the center of the IS membrane in the direction of the centrosome observed in &#x0201c;frustrated&#x0201d; Jurkat&#x02013;APC conjugates argues strongly that the force-generating mechanism driving MTOC repositioning is focused at the center of the IS and not its periphery. Second, dynamic imaging of microtubules during normal MTOC repositioning revealed microtubule end-on attachments near or at the center of the IS that are followed by the shortening of these microtubules, thereby drawing the centrosome to the IS. These dynamic images are consistent with MTOC repositioning being driven by the capture-shrinkage mechanism focused at the center of the IS and not with the cortical sliding mechanism operating at the IS periphery. Third, we observed small invaginations of the IS membrane at the point where the shortening microtubules abut the IS, suggesting the presence of force generation there. Of note, these small invaginations may be related to the frequent, &#x0223c;1-&#x000b5;m deep T cell invaginations (and corresponding protrusions in the APC) seen at the center of the IS in T cell&#x02013;APC conjugates during the first several minutes after productive contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Singleton et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, inhibition of either dynein or microtubule depolymerization inhibited MTOC repositioning, consistent with the capture-shrinkage mechanism. Although these results argue strongly that the microtubule end-on capture-shrinkage mechanism plays a major role in MTOC repositioning in T cells, we cannot rigorously exclude the possibility that the cortical sliding of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kuhn and Poenie, 2002</xref>) makes some contribution to the process.</p><p>As currently envisioned, the capture-shrinkage mechanism obligatorily couples the stepping of cortically anchored dynein attached to the microtubule plus end with the depolymerization of this end to create the pulling force on the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Laan et al., 2012</xref>). This mechanism should, therefore, be fully abrogated by complete inhibition of either dynein or microtubule depolymerization. We attribute the partial inhibitions of MTOC repositioning we saw with Ciliobrevin-D or taxol treatment as being due to partial inhibitions of dynein and (especially) microtubule depolymerization, respectively. This interpretation is consistent with the partial effects on asymmetric spindle positioning seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos treated with taxol or after dynein inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, our inhibition studies could be interpreted as evidence of two parallel, partially redundant pathways driving MTOC repositioning in Jurkats&#x02014;one driven by dynein and one by microtubule depolymerization&#x02014;although we do not favor this idea. The partial inhibitions could also reflect the contribution of a microtubule-independent pathway to MTOC repositioning (e.g., some form of actomyosin-dependent contribution), although the total cessation of centrosome repositioning we observed with combined Ciliobrevin-D/taxol treatment does not seem to support that idea. Finally, given that MTOC repositioning itself helps drive sustained T cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mart&#x000ed;n-C&#x000f3;freces et al., 2008</xref>), we cannot exclude some contribution of reduced signaling to the defects seen in Ciliobrevin-D&#x02013; and taxol-treated cells.</p><p>For several teleological reasons we think that the microtubule end-on capture-shrinkage mechanism makes more sense than the cortical sliding mechanism for driving MTOC repositioning. First, because the force vector in end-on capture-shrinkage is perpendicular to the plane of the membrane, the path of least resistance should usually be centrosome repositioning. By contrast, in the cortical sliding mechanism, where the force vector should often be nearly parallel to the plane of the membrane, the path of least resistance will often be the sliding of dynein&#x02019;s anchor point in the plane of the membrane rather than MTOC repositioning. Second, it is hard to imagine how a cortical sliding mechanism could avoid microtubules being pulled in a variety of different directions across the IS interface, significantly reducing the efficiency and reproducibility of the process. Finally, for this same reason, the capture-shrinkage mechanism seems more consistent with the relatively constant and highly reproducible speed of MTOC movement seen during the polarization phase.</p><p>We think the biphasic nature of MTOC repositioning reflects a force&#x02013;velocity relationship in which the emergence of a resistive force around 2 &#x000b5;m from the IS causes the centrosome to move at a slower speed during the docking phase. The emergence of this resistive force is sometimes abrupt, leading to a sharp reduction in speed, and other times not, leading to a more gradual reduction in speed. This resistive force also results in a differential sensitivity to partial dynein inhibition, with the &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; force docking phase being more sensitive (i.e., completely inhibited) than the &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; force polarization phase (partially inhibited). Candidate resistive forces include physical impediments to MTOC progression (e.g., organelles in the way) or the emergence of a force that opposes dynein at the IS (e.g., dynein on the nuclear envelope; although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lui-Roberts et al., 2012</xref>, who showed that MTOC&#x02013;nuclear envelope interaction in T cells is minimal).</p><p>Several aspects of our work merit further investigation. These include identifying the nature of dynein&#x02019;s cortical anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Combs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>), looking for the possible contribution of a depolymerizing kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ten Hoopen et al., 2012</xref>), and addressing the possible role of Lis1, which appears to be required for dynein to exhibit high force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vallee et al., 2012</xref>), and which is part of the capture-shrinkage mechanism in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we present evidence that MTOC repositioning in Jurkat T cells is driven predominantly by the microtubule end-on capture-shrinkage mechanism, where the stepping of cortically anchored dynein attached to the plus end of the microtubule, coupled with microtubule plus-end depolymerization, creates in a mutual and interdependent fashion the pulling force on the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Laan et al., 2012</xref>). The mechanism is focused at the center of the IS and not at its periphery, and drives a repositioning process possessing two kinetic phases that rapidly and robustly draws the centrosome to the IS membrane to support the vectorial delivery of effector molecules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, transfection, plasmids, and reagents</title><p>E6.1, JCAM2.5, and JB2.7 Jurkat T cells and Raji B cells (gifts from Larry Samelson [NIH, Bethesda, MD] and Martin Poenie [University of Texas, Austin, TX]) were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in IMDM media (#12440; Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (#F0392; Sigma-Aldrich), sodium pyruvate (#11360; Invitrogen), <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (#25030; Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin (#15140; Invitrogen), and MEM nonessential amino acids solution (#11140; Invitrogen).

Stage temperature was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C using a Nevtek stage heater. For imaging MTOC repositioning, the focal plane was occasionally adjusted to maintain focus on the centrosome. For imaging the dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton, 3D time-lapse images (ten 1 &#x000b5;m-thick optical sections acquired over 3 s every 10 or 15 s) were obtained using a stage controller (NanoScan Z; Prior Scientific). For imaging intracellular calcium flux, Jurkat cells were loaded before conjugate formation with 5 &#x000b5;M Fluo-4AM for 60 min in cell culture medium and washed, as described by the manufacturer. Measurement of MTOC repositioning in the presence of EGTA and BAPTA-AM to chelate extracellular and intracellular calcium, respectively, was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quann et al., 2009</xref>), except that 2 mM EGTA was used, Jurkats were preincubated in 50 &#x000b5;M BAPTA-AM for 20 min, and Fluo-4AM was also loaded to confirm the lack of intracellular calcium flux. We avoided the use of GFP-chimeras when imaging in the presence of Ciliobrevin-D, as blue light leads to cell toxicity (green light with RFP-chimeras is fine). Images were analyzed using MetaMorph software.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of MTOC movement</title><p>MTOC-to-IS distances were obtained by measuring the distance from the center of the fluorescent MTOC to the plane of contact between the Jurkat and Raji cell, obtained either from the bright-field image or from the position of the mRFP-Farnesyl&#x02013;labeled T cell membrane. To obtain the instantaneous speed of MTOC movement, the MTOC-to-IS distance in each frame was subtracted from that in the previous frame and the product divided by the elapsed time between the two frames. Unless indicated otherwise, only positive pixel displacements (one or more pixels) in the direction of the IS were included in calculating speeds. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed with Origin software, using Ward&#x02019;s Method and Squared Euclidean Distance Interval settings. The Calinski and Harabatz Index analysis was performed using the &#x0201c;fpc&#x0201d; package in R software, a Calinski and Harabatz Index of 2&#x02013;6 cluster fits, and 20 rolling simulations. To obtain the point of transition between the two kinetic phases, the MTOC-to-IS distance at which the largest deceleration in the instantaneous velocity occurred was recorded and averaged in nine WT cells.
