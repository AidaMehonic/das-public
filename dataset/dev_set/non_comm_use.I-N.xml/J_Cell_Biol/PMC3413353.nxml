We show here that the poorly characterized eisosome protein Seg1/Ymr086w is important for eisosome biogenesis and architecture. Seg1 was required for efficient incorporation of Pil1 into eisosomes and the generation of normal plasma membrane furrows. Seg1 preceded Pil1 during eisosome formation and established a platform for the assembly of other eisosome components. This platform was further shaped and stabilized upon the arrival of Pil1 and Lsp1. Moreover, Seg1 abundance controlled the shape of eisosomes by determining their length. Similarly, the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Seg1-like protein Sle1 was necessary to generate the filamentous eisosomes present in fission yeast. The function of Seg1 in the stepwise biogenesis of eisosomes reveals striking architectural similarities between eisosomes in yeast and caveolae in mammals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells subdivide their plasma membrane into regions with specialized functions. One way to achieve this compartmentalization is to construct diffusion barriers within the plasma membrane and furnish the resulting surface domains with unique compositions by means of dedicated membrane trafficking pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schuck and Simons, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caudron and Barral, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steed et al., 2010</xref>). Another way to segregate plasma membrane components is based on the propensity of certain lipids, namely sterols and sphingolipids, to form microdomains by preferential association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>). These microdomains, called lipid rafts, can be clustered into larger assemblies by specialized protein scaffolds. Mammalian scaffolding proteins of this type are the caveolins. These integral membrane proteins bind cholesterol, polymerize into stable protein lattices, and shape the plasma membrane into 60&#x02013;80-nm-deep cup-like caveolae that serve as sites of clathrin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parton and Simons, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen and Nichols, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastiani and Parton, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> possesses plasma membrane domains that share many fundamental features with caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zi&#x000f3;&#x00142;kowska et al., 2012</xref>). Their principal protein components are Pil1 and Lsp1, two highly similar cytoplasmic proteins that are each present at an abundance of &#x0223c;100,000 copies per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>). The two proteins bind to one another and generate 20&#x02013;50 immobile plasma membrane-associated assemblies in every cell, with each assembly containing on the order of 2,000&#x02013;5,000 subunits of both Pil1 and Lsp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walther et al., 2006</xref>). Pil1/Lsp1 assemblies are evenly distributed over the plasma membrane and maintain a minimal distance from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreira et al., 2009</xref>). The sites at which Pil1/Lsp1 associate with the plasma membrane correspond to furrow-like membrane invaginations that are &#x0223c;50 nm deep and 200&#x02013;300 nm long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Str&#x000e1;dalov&#x000e1; et al., 2009</xref>). These invaginated membrane patches appear to be enriched in ergosterol, the major yeast sterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>), and they require sphingolipids for proper organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grossmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fr&#x000f6;hlich et al., 2009</xref>). Pil1/Lsp1 have been suggested to participate in endocytosis, but this connection remains to be clarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walther et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brach et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The Pil1/Lsp1 assemblies have been named &#x0201c;eisosomes&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walther et al., 2006</xref>), whereas the ergosterol-enriched membrane patches that colocalize with Pil1/Lsp1 have been called &#x0201c;membrane compartment of arginine permease Can1&#x0201d; (MCC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mal&#x000ed;nsk&#x000e1; et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mal&#x000ed;nsky et al., 2010</xref>). The terms eisosome and MCC likely describe connected parts of the same cellular structure. First, in cells lacking Pil1, MCC-associated transmembrane proteins disperse in the plasma membrane and furrow-like invaginations disappear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walther et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fr&#x000f6;hlich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Str&#x000e1;dalov&#x000e1; et al., 2009</xref>). The integrity of the MCC therefore depends on the eisosome protein Pil1. Second, disruption of the MCC, for example by sphingolipid depletion, is relayed to Pil1 by phosphorylation, and causes a large fraction of Pil1 to dissociate from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walther et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fr&#x000f6;hlich et al., 2009</xref>). The integrity of eisosomes therefore depends on an intact MCC. Third, Pil1 and Lsp1 both contain membrane-shaping BAR domains, bind to liposomes in vitro, and self-assemble into filaments whose dimensions match those of plasma membrane furrows in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karotki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olivera-Couto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zi&#x000f3;&#x00142;kowska et al., 2011</xref>). Eisosome components in cells are therefore likely to directly interact with and scaffold the plasma membrane. In view of these links, we suggest treating the whole subcellular structure as a single entity, consisting of a furrow-like plasma membrane domain, the transmembrane proteins that partition into this domain, and the proteins that form a scaffolding lattice on its cytoplasmic face. In this paper, we shall use the term eisosome in this sense.</p><p>The proper assembly of eisosomes critically depends on Pil1. In its absence, Lsp1 is mostly cytoplasmic, whereas Pil1 retains its normal distribution in cells lacking Lsp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walther et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, without Pil1, eisosome components partially collapse into a small number of clusters, referred to as eisosome remnants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walther et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>). Eisosome remnants correspond to large aberrant plasma membrane invaginations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walther et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Str&#x000e1;dalov&#x000e1; et al., 2009</xref>). Reducing or raising the levels of Pil1 yields a lower number of normal eisosomes or a normal number of larger eisosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreira et al., 2009</xref>). These observations indicate that there is a lower limit for eisosome size and an upper limit for eisosome number. The molecular mechanisms imposing these limits are unknown.</p><p>To better understand the architecture and ultimately the function of eisosomes, we have previously conducted a screen to identify genes involved in eisosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fr&#x000f6;hlich et al., 2009</xref>). Several of the identified genes had no known function. Here, we study one of these poorly characterized genes, YMR086W, which encodes a large coiled-coil protein without recognizable functional domains. Based on the observation that its homologue in the yeast <italic>Ashbya gossypii</italic> is important for eisosome stability, YMR086W has been named <italic>SEG1</italic> for &#x0201c;stability of eisosomes guaranteed&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seger et al., 2011</xref>). We find that the Seg1 protein facilitates eisosome assembly and controls eisosome shape.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Seg1 is required for proper eisosome architecture</title><p>Our previous screen had shown that cells lacking Seg1 fail to properly localize Pil1-GFP, which indicates a defect in eisosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fr&#x000f6;hlich et al., 2009</xref>). To analyze this phenotype in detail, we first imaged Pil1-GFP in wild-type and <italic>seg1</italic>&#x00394; cells. In the absence of Seg1, cells displayed a reduced number of eisosomes, as defined by Pil1-GFP patches at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In addition, the Pil1-GFP signal of remaining eisosomes was decreased and the cytoplasmic Pil1-GFP signal was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). These findings show that Seg1 is required for efficient incorporation of Pil1-GFP into eisosomes.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Seg1 is required for proper eisosome architecture.</bold> (A) Confocal images of Pil1-GFP in wild-type (WT) and <italic>seg1&#x00394;</italic> cells.

Consistent with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moor and M&#x000fc;hlethaler, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Str&#x000e1;dalov&#x000e1; et al., 2009</xref>), wild-type cells showed plasma membrane furrows &#x0223c;30 nm deep, 30 nm wide and 200 nm long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, left; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201202097/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link> for serial sections). In contrast, s<italic>eg1</italic>&#x00394; cells had deep, irregularly shaped plasma membrane invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, middle and top right; see Fig. S1 B for serial sections). These invaginations were sometimes reminiscent of eisosome remnants seen in <italic>pil1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, bottom right), but were generally smaller. These findings show that Seg1 is required for proper plasma membrane morphology. It appears likely that the aberrant invaginations observed in <italic>seg1</italic>&#x00394; cells by electron microscopy correspond to the remaining Pil1-GFP patches seen in these cells by light microscopy. Collectively, Seg1 is needed for two aspects of eisosome architecture: the assembly of Pil1-GFP into membrane-associated complexes of characteristic size and the local molding of the plasma membrane into well-defined furrows.</p></sec><sec><title>Seg1 is an eisosome component</title><p>Seg1 has been shown to colocalize with Lsp1 and interact with Pil1/Lsp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, Seg1-GFP colocalized with Pil1-cherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We next used immunogold labeling with an anti-GFP antibody to localize Seg1-GFP by immunoelectron microscopy. As expected, the immunogold marked plasma membrane invaginations characteristic of eisosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Although the labeling was specific, its density was quite low, possibly because the GFP epitope is rendered largely inaccessible by the eisosomal protein lattice.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Seg1 is an eisosome component.</bold> (A) Confocal mid sections of cells expressing Seg1-GFP and Pil1-cherry.

Because a single eisosome contains 2,000&#x02013;5,000 molecules of each Pil1 and Lsp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walther et al., 2006</xref>), there are likely 200&#x02013;500 Seg1 molecules per eisosome.</p><p>To identify Seg1 interaction partners, we quantitatively analyzed Seg1 immunoprecipitates using SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture). We immunopurified Seg1 from cells that expressed Seg1-TEV-GFP and had been metabolically labeled with heavy isotope lysine. The resulting eluate was mixed with that from a mock purification using untagged control cells grown in the presence of normal, light isotope lysine. Finally, the ratio of heavy/light lysine was determined for each protein identified by mass spectrometry. A high heavy/light ratio for a given protein indicates enrichment in the metabolically labeled sample and hence interaction with Seg1. By this measure, Seg1 interacts with the known eisosome proteins Pil1, Lsp1, Eis1/Ymr031c, and Ygr130c, as well as the Seg1 paralogue Seg2/Ykl105c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). These results confirm that Seg1 is an eisosome protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Seg1 precedes Pil1 during eisosome assembly</title><p>To begin to investigate the role of Seg1 in eisosome formation, we analyzed the incorporation of Seg1 into nascent eisosomes during yeast budding. Growing buds are initially devoid of eisosomes as marked by Pil1 and Lsp1. Once a bud exceeds a critical size, it is colonized by newly assembled eisosomes. Colonization occurs in a polarized fashion, starting from the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreira et al., 2009</xref>). However, when we imaged the deposition of Seg1, we observed Seg1-GFP already in small buds, where it was diffusely distributed and formed heterogeneous patches at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, top). Medium-sized buds were evenly colonized by Seg1-GFP patches, whereas Pil1-GFP patches exhibited the characteristic polarized distribution observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, middle). Large buds showed a uniform pattern for both Seg1-GFP and Pil1-GFP patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, bottom). These observations indicate that Seg1 deposition precedes that of Pil1. We also attempted to image Seg1 and Pil1 in the same cells by fusing them to different fluorescent proteins. However, these experiments were rendered uninterpretable by the different maturation times of the fluorophores so that the protein fused to the faster maturing fluorescent protein always seemed to enter growing buds first. To refine our results, we quantified Seg1-GFP patches in buds of different sizes and plotted their number against bud surface area. Consistent with earlier measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreira et al., 2009</xref>), Pil1-GFP patches were absent in buds with a surface area &#x0003c;15 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>, showing a lag phase for Pil1 deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In contrast, there was no lag phase for the formation of Seg1-GFP patches, which indicates that deposition of Seg1 does not require a minimum bud size. These results confirm that Seg1 becomes part of eisosome precursors before the arrival of Pil1.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Seg1 precedes Pil1 during eisosome assembly.</bold> (A) Projections from confocal stacks of cells expressing Seg1-GFP (left) or Pil1-GFP (right).

To test this idea, we analyzed Seg1-GFP in <italic>pil1&#x00394;</italic> cells. Consistent with Pil1 being critical for eisosome biogenesis, Seg1-GFP displayed an uneven distribution at the plasma membrane with a few remaining patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, middle). Additional deletion of Lsp1 had no effect, nor did deletion of Lsp1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, right; and not depicted).</p><p>Given that Seg1 has no predicted transmembrane domains, its plasma membrane association in <italic>pil1&#x00394;</italic> cells and in small buds lacking Pil1 was unexpected. So far, eisosome proteins without transmembrane domains, such as Lsp1 and Pkh2, have been found mainly in the cytoplasm in the absence of Pil1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walther et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2007</xref>). We noticed that the C terminus of Seg1 contains clusters of basic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). To test if this region mediates plasma membrane association, we analyzed the localization of Seg1&#x00394;942-GFP, which lacks the last 18 amino acids of Seg1. The truncated Seg1 localized mostly to eisosomes in wild-type cells, as judged by colocalization with Pil1-cherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In addition, cells expressing untagged Seg1&#x00394;942 as the only copy of Seg1 had a normal steady-state distribution of Pil1-GFP (unpublished data). However, Seg1&#x00394;942-GFP was completely cytoplasmic in <italic>pil1&#x00394; lsp1&#x00394;</italic> cells, demonstrating that the basic C terminus targets Seg1 to the plasma membrane in the absence of Pil1/Lsp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). To test directly if the C terminus of Seg1 is able to bind lipids, we fused it to GST and assayed binding of recombinant GST-Seg1(941&#x02013;960) to liposomes of varying composition. GST-Seg1(941&#x02013;960) showed binding to liposomes consisting exclusively of phosphatidylcholine, but binding was enhanced by addition of the negatively charged lipids phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), phosphatidylserine, or phosphatidic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Therefore, the C terminus of Seg1 is sufficient to bind lipids, at least in vitro. We conclude that Seg1 is kept at the plasma membrane by two interactions. The first requires Pil1/Lsp1 and may involve direct binding to Pil1 or Lsp1, whereas the second is independent of Pil1/Lsp1 and requires the polybasic C terminus of Seg1.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Targeting of Seg1 to small buds via its lipid-binding C terminus is important for efficient eisosome assembly.</bold> (A) Confocal images of wild-type (WT) cells expressing Seg1<italic>&#x00394;</italic>942-GFP and Pil1-cherry.

We measured the formation of Seg1&#x00394;942-GFP patches in growing buds and found that the truncated protein was excluded from small buds almost as stringently as Pil1-GFP. Fitting of the data revealed a critical bud size for patch formation of 14 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> compared with 0 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> for Seg1-GFP and 15 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> for Pil1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Accordingly, the mean number of patches formed by Seg1&#x00394;942-GFP in buds with a surface area of 1&#x02212;20 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> was significantly lower than that of Seg1-GFP and similar to that of Pil1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>). This result shows that the C terminus is important for targeting of Seg1 to small buds. To examine the role of Seg1 targeting in eisosome assembly, we compared deposition of Pil1-GFP in buds of wild-type, <italic>seg1&#x00394;</italic>, and <italic>seg1&#x00394;942</italic> cells. Formation of Pil1-GFP patches in the buds of <italic>seg1&#x00394;</italic> cells was diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). The same was true for cells expressing Seg1&#x00394;942 as the only copy of Seg1. This result was confirmed by determining the mean number of Pil1-GFP patches in buds with a surface area of 40&#x02013;75 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>, which revealed a reduced number of patches in <italic>seg1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>seg1&#x00394;942</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>). Thus, the arrival of Seg1 in small buds by means of its lipid-binding C terminus is important for the subsequent incorporation of Pil1-GFP into nascent eisosomes.</p><p>Our results suggest the following order of events during eisosome assembly: first, the C-terminus of Seg1 mediates Pil1/Lsp1-independent targeting to the plasma membrane in small buds, where Seg1 assembles into loose patches. Pil1/Lsp1 then arrives at these patches and stabilizes them into well-defined eisosomes. Whether all Seg1 patches become eisosomes or some represent unproductive intermediates remains to be established. Because Seg1&#x00394;942 supports a normal steady-state distribution of Pil1, Seg1 is ultimately dispensable for the targeting of Pil1/Lsp1 to the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, the early arrival of Seg1 is important for efficient eisosome assembly, perhaps by ensuring that no assembly is initiated at sites devoid of Seg1.</p></sec><sec><title>Seg1 controls eisosome shape</title><p>If Seg1 indeed helps organize eisosome assembly, raising Seg1 levels might change eisosome morphology. We therefore placed Seg1 under the control of the copper-inducible <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter and followed eisosome formation using Pil1-GFP. The <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter is leaky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janke et al., 2004</xref>), and the amount of Seg1 produced even in the absence of copper was sufficient for normal eisosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, left). However, after overnight growth in the presence of 100 &#x000b5;M CuSO<sub>4</sub> to overexpress Seg1, mother cells had striking, rod-shaped eisosomes that were aligned parallel to the plane of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, right, top cell). Young daughter cells that still shared the cytoplasm with their mothers showed reduced eisosome density yet had normal, round eisosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, right, bottom cell). Because the amount of Pil1-GFP is unchanged by Seg1 overexpression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201202097/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>), eisosome overassembly in mother cells may hamper formation of new eisosomes in daughter cells.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Seg1 can direct the formation of rod-shaped eisosomes.</bold> (A) Confocal images of Pil1-GFP cells expressing Seg1 from the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter.

Because of the leakiness of the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter, growth in the absence of copper yielded Seg1-GFP levels somewhat higher than those in cells expressing Seg1-GFP from the endogenous <italic>SEG1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Growth in medium with up to 900 &#x000b5;M CuSO<sub>4</sub> yielded up to 50-fold higher expression levels. Seg1-GFP in the uninduced condition showed a normal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, left, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). However, as we raised the copper concentration, Seg1-GFP structures elongated and eventually became filamentous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, right). These results suggest that Seg1 can control the shape of eisosomes.</p><p>To further explore the properties of elongated eisosomes in cells overproducing Seg1, we generated strains that constitutively express Seg1-GFP at high levels, thus obviating the need for growth with CuSO<sub>4</sub>. We deleted the endogenous <italic>SEG1</italic> gene and integrated a Seg1-GFP construct including the <italic>SEG1</italic> promoter into the <italic>URA3</italic> locus. The <italic>SEG1</italic> promoter is more active in this location, resulting in approximately ninefold higher Seg1-GFP levels compared with strains expressing Seg1-GFP from the native <italic>SEG1</italic> locus (Fig. S2 B). These elevated levels were sufficient to generate rod-shaped eisosomes, as is best appreciated in 2D projections from confocal stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, left). Next, we tested whether formation of Seg1-GFP rods requires Pil1 or Lsp1. Deleting Pil1 yielded rods that were thicker but also shorter and less abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, middle). The increased thickness may account for the decrease in rod length and number because sequestration of Seg1-GFP into thick rods may reduce free Seg1-GFP below the concentrations necessary to drive elongation of existing rods or assembly of new ones. Additional deletion of Lsp1 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, right). These results show that overexpressed Seg1 can assemble into plasma membrane-associated rods independently of Pil1/Lsp1. In addition, they suggest that Pil1 can shape Seg1 rods by restricting their width. This finding reinforces the notion that Pil1 and Seg1 collaborate during eisosome assembly in that Seg1 provides an early platform that is reshaped upon incorporation of Pil1.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Seg1 rods form without Pil1 and contain eisosome components.</bold> (A) Projections from confocal stacks of wild-type (WT), <italic>pil1&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>and pil1&#x00394; lsp1&#x00394;</italic> cells lacking endogenous Seg1 and expressing Seg1-GFP from the <italic>URA3</italic> locus.

To this end, we first tested whether Seg1-GFP rods colocalize with other eisosome components. Consistent with the results obtained with copper-induced overexpression of untagged Seg1, Seg1-GFP rods completely reorganized the intracellular distribution of Pil1-cherry, which was now found in the same rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Lsp1-cherry also localized to Seg1 rods, in both otherwise wild-type and <italic>pil1&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figs. 6 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201202097/DC1" id="supp3">S3 A</ext-link>). The relocalization to Seg1 rods in wild-type cells was expected because Lsp1 binds to and therefore follows Pil1. The localization of Lsp1 to Seg1 rods in the absence of Pil1, however, was surprising. Lsp1 has so far only been found in the cytoplasm and in eisosome remnants in cells lacking Pil1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walther et al., 2006</xref>). The fact that overproduction of Seg1 prevents Lsp1 from becoming cytoplasmic and redirects it into Seg1 rods points to a Pil1-independent interaction of Lsp1 and Seg1. Notably, Lsp1 is unable to shape Seg1-GFP rods into long, thin filaments as Pil1 does, despite closely resembling Pil1 in structure and abundance. Finally, we analyzed the distribution of ergosterol by filipin staining and found that ergosterol patches colocalize with elongated eisosomes in Seg1-GFP&#x02013;overproducing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Interestingly, the localization of ergosterol to Seg1-GFP rods was abolished in <italic>pil1&#x00394;</italic> cells (Fig. S3 B).</p><p>Our results show that overexpressed Seg1 forms membrane-associated rod-like structures, even in the absence of Pil1. These structures contain other eisosome components, including Pil1, Lsp1, and ergosterol. Thus, formation of Seg1 rods recapitulates aspects of normal eisosome assembly and reveals a role for Seg1 in controlling eisosome shape. Localization of Lsp1 to Seg1 rods is independent of Pil1, whereas enrichment of ergosterol at these sites requires Pil1, highlighting that Pil1 and Seg1 coordinate different steps of eisosome assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Seg1 controls eisosome length</title><p>Next, we analyzed Seg1-GFP&#x02013;overproducing cells by electron microscopy to determine if Seg1 rods affect plasma membrane morphology. We observed plasma membrane furrows of normal width and depth. However, these furrows were encountered much more frequently than in cells with normal Seg1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>). Importantly, serial sections revealed that plasma membrane furrows in cells overproducing Seg1-GFP were unusually long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). The elongation of plasma membrane furrows likely accounts for their more frequent appearance in single thin sections because it increases the probability that furrows are captured in any given section. Quantification from serial sections showed that the furrows are 510 &#x000b1; 130 nm long (<italic>n</italic> = 10), which is substantially longer than the 200 nm observed in cells with normal Seg1 levels.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Seg1 can direct the formation of plasma membrane invaginations.</bold> (A and B) Electron micrographs of wild-type (WT) cells lacking endogenous Seg1 and expressing Seg1-GFP from the <italic>URA3</italic> locus.

Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that Seg1-GFP localized to these invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 F</xref>). Intriguingly, Seg1-GFP was typically seen adjacent to the neck of these large invaginations, which may reflect a role for Seg1 in the inward bending of the plasma membrane.</p><p>In conclusion, Seg1-GFP&#x02013;overproducing cells generate Seg1 rods that contain other eisosome components and shape the plasma membrane into elongated but otherwise normal furrows. These findings suggest that Seg1 rods are neither random aggregates nor eisosome remnants but true eisosomes, albeit with an altered shape. Thus, Seg1 specifically controls the geometry of eisosomes by determining their length.</p></sec><sec><title>Seg1-like Sle1 is required for filamentous eisosomes in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic></title><p>The elongated eisosomes resulting from Seg1 overexpression are reminiscent of fission yeast eisosomes, which appear as elongated filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kabeche et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore wondered if a Seg1-like protein in fission yeast might facilitate the assembly of elongated eisosomes in these cells. We could not identify any fission yeast gene with clear sequence homology to <italic>S. cerevisiae SEG1</italic>, but we examined the uncharacterized gene SPAC1A6.07 for two reasons. First, SPAC1A6.07 is a large coiled-coil protein with a polybasic C terminus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201202097/DC1" id="supp5">Fig. S5 A</ext-link>). Second, a fragment of this protein localized to eisosome-like structures in a large-scale localization study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2000</xref>). We confirmed that SPAC1A6.07 is an eisosome protein as judged by colocalization with Pil1-cherry in the middle of the cells, where mature filamentous eisosomes are found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). SPAC1A6.07 was also present at the cell tips. We mapped the eisosome-targeting domain of SPAC1A6.07 to an N-terminal region that is necessary and sufficient for colocalization with Pil1. In the absence of this region, the polybasic C terminus is required for general plasma membrane localization (Fig. S5 B). Thus, SPAC1A6.07 contains separate eisosome and plasma membrane targeting domains. Based on these similarities to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Seg1, we have renamed this protein Sle1, for Seg1-like eisosome protein 1.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Sle1/SPAC1A6.07 is an <italic>S. pombe</italic> eisosome protein required for filamentous eisosomes.</bold> (A) Colocalization of Sle1 and Pil1.

Indeed, Pil1-cherry filaments were disrupted in <italic>sle1&#x00394;</italic> cells, showing that proper assembly of elongated eisosomes requires Sle1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 B</xref>). Thus, Sle1 appears to function in <italic>S. pombe</italic> in a similar manner as Seg1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which suggests that basic features of eisosome biogenesis and architecture have been conserved between the two yeasts, despite their evolutionary divergence more than 1 billion years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heckman et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that Seg1 is required for proper eisosome assembly, that it precedes Pil1/Lsp1 during the formation of eisosomes, and that Seg1 levels determine eisosome length. We propose that the membrane domains generated by Seg1 serve as assembly platforms for Pil1/Lsp1, which are then converted into mature eisosomes. Hence, eisosomes arise through the coordinated assembly of mutually dependent components. Without Pil1, aberrant eisosome remnants form. Without Seg1, eisosomes assemble less efficiently and contain less Pil1. Thus, Seg1 also helps to determine the previously postulated minimum size of normal eisosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreira et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>How could Seg1 facilitate eisosome assembly? One possibility is that Seg1 regulates Pil1 phosphorylation. Nce102 controls Pkh1/2 kinases, which can phosphorylate Pil1 on multiple sites, causing eisosome disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walther et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fr&#x000f6;hlich et al., 2009</xref>). We tested the role of Seg1 in the Nce102&#x02013;Pkh1/2&#x02013;Pil1 phosphorylation pathway by disrupting <italic>SEG1</italic> in cells expressing Pil1(4A)-GFP as the only copy of Pil1. If eisosome disassembly in <italic>seg1</italic>&#x00394; cells were caused by increased Pil1 phosphorylation, nonphosphorylatable Pil1(4A) eisosomes should be resistant to <italic>SEG1</italic> disruption. However, Pil1(4A), like wild-type Pil1, was partially cytoplasmic in the absence of Seg1 (unpublished data). Therefore, Seg1 is not a regulator of Pil1 phosphorylation at previously identified sites. A second possibility is that Seg1 links Pil1/Lsp1 to the plasma membrane. However, cells expressing only truncated Seg1&#x00394;942, which cannot associate with the plasma membrane without Pil1/Lsp1, show a normal steady-state distribution of Pil1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Therefore, Seg1 is not a tether for Pil1/Lsp1, and its C terminus is not strictly necessary for eisosome assembly. The lipid-binding C terminus does, however, ensure the early presence of Seg1 at sites of eisosome formation and makes the generation of eisosomes more efficient, possibly by restraining aberrant assembly without the participation of Seg1. A third possibility is that Seg1 remodels the plasma membrane to assist eisosome assembly. The elongated furrows produced by overexpressed Seg1 suggest that Seg1 can induce membrane bending. Pil1/Lsp1 alone are able to bind and tubulate liposomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karotki et al., 2011</xref>), but the generation of membrane furrows in vivo may involve additional proteins. An attractive speculation is that Seg1 initiates plasma membrane invagination and in this way prepares the deposition of Pil1/Lsp1. The subsequent assembly of the Pil1/Lsp1 lattice, which forms a half cylinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karotki et al., 2011</xref>), would exert a constricting force and give the membrane its final shape. Without prior membrane remodeling by Seg1, Pil1/Lsp1 may produce less stable eisosomes, resulting in the observed partial localization of Pil1 to the cytoplasm. This scenario is consistent with work on the <italic>A. gossypii</italic> Seg1, which is dispensable for the initial targeting of Pil1 to regions of eisosome formation but required for its sustained membrane association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seger et al., 2011</xref>). How Seg1 specifically controls eisosome length remains to be discovered but may involve Seg1 polymers that serve as a ruler. Furthermore, there must be additional morphogenic factors because irregularly shaped plasma membrane invaginations persist in a quadruple mutant lacking Pil1, Lsp1, Seg1, and Seg2 (unpublished data).</p><p>The yeast gene most closely related to <italic>SEG1</italic> is <italic>SEG2/YKL105C</italic>. Like <italic>SEG1</italic>, <italic>SEG2</italic> encodes a large coiled-coil protein with a polybasic C terminus. The Seg2 protein directly or indirectly interacts with Seg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Similar to Seg1-GFP, Seg2-GFP localizes to eisosomes and requires the basic C terminus of Seg2 for plasma membrane association in the absence of Pil1/Lsp1 (unpublished data). Nevertheless, we found that disruption of <italic>SEG2</italic> does not impair eisosome assembly and only slightly exacerbates the <italic>seg1</italic> mutant phenotype. Furthermore, Seg2 protein levels are 10-fold lower than those of Seg1, or 100-fold lower than those of Pil1. Thus, Seg2 is an eisosome component but likely plays only a minor role in eisosome assembly.</p><p>Our study extends the intriguing similarities between eisosomes and caveolae. Until recently, the caveolins (caveolin-1/2/3) were thought to be the sole structural proteins of caveolae. Caveolins assume hairpin structures in the membrane, assemble into large protein lattices, and shape cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich membranes into cuplike caveolae by wedging and scaffolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shibata et al., 2009</xref>). This picture has become more complex with the discovery of the cavins (cavin-1/2/3/4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen and Nichols, 2010</xref>). Cavins are cytosolic coiled-coil proteins that form large complexes with one another, contain polybasic regions, and bind phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgener et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, caveolins cluster phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wanaski et al., 2003</xref>) and may thereby create multivalent binding platforms for the cavins. Depleting or removing cavin-1 or cavin-2 causes loss of caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hansen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McMahon et al., 2009</xref>). In the absence of cavin-1, caveolin-1 diffuses in the plasma membrane, indicating that cavins immobilize caveolins at invaginated caveolar membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2008</xref>). Cavin-2 overexpression induces long plasma membrane tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hansen et al., 2009</xref>). Caveolin-1 overexpression also causes tubule formation, which can be suppressed by raising cavin-1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Verma et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, proper caveola morphology depends on the balance between caveolins and cavins. During caveola biogenesis, caveolin complexes arrive at the plasma membrane first, where they organize domains rich in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and possibly phosphatidylserine. Incipient caveolae are then stabilized by cavin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayer et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, Pacsin 2, a BAR domain protein, has recently been found to participate in caveola biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Senju et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>These new findings reveal principles of construction that are shared by caveolae and eisosomes. Both domains consist of characteristic plasma membrane invaginations coated with heteromultimeric protein scaffolds. Both caveolae and eisosomes self-assemble in a stepwise fashion, with caveolins and Seg1 arriving first, followed by cavins and Pil1/Lsp1. Generation of the proper plasma membrane shape requires balanced levels of mutually dependent components in both cases, as is evident from the contorted morphologies produced by overexpression of cavin-2, caveolin-1, or Seg1. In addition, caveolar and eisosome shape generation involves BAR domain proteins, namely Pacsin 2 and Pil1/Lsp1. Finally, both caveolae and eisosomes are domains rich in sterols and sphingolipids and may use negatively charged lipids, such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujita et al., 2009</xref>), for the recruitment of some of their protein components, including cavins and Seg1. Caveolae and eisosomes therefore represent a remarkable example of convergent evolution, in which unrelated proteins assemble into corresponding structures by means of strikingly similar architectural principles.</p><p>How the form of eisosomes relates to their functions remains to be resolved. Paradoxically, eisosomes have been proposed to act as endocytic portals similar to caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walther et al., 2006</xref>), to constitute membrane domains protected from endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>), and to have no role in endocytosis at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brach et al., 2011</xref>). The elongated and easily visible eisosomes generated by Seg1 overexpression may prove useful in investigating the controversial spatial organization of yeast endocytosis. We anticipate that our still limited understanding of eisosome function will improve rapidly as we elaborate new ways of manipulating eisosome architecture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201202097/DC1" id="supp6">Table S1</ext-link>.

Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. GFP fusion proteins were detected with mouse anti-GFP antibody 7.1/13.1 (Roche). Pgk1 was detected with mouse anti-Pgk1 antibody 22C5 (Invitrogen). After incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were probed with alkaline phosphatase&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibodies (EMD Millipore) and incubated with enhanced chemifluorescence substrate (GE Healthcare).

Images were taken at room temperature on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss) and an inverted microscope (TE2000U; Nikon) with a Yokogawa CSU22 spinning disk confocal from Solamere Technology (provided by the Nikon Imaging Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA), controlled by Micro-manager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>), or a Deltavision Imaging System (Applied Precision; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kabeche et al., 2011</xref>). Images were processed using ImageJ software. Cytoplasmic and eisosomal Pil1-GFP fluorescence were quantified according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fr&#x000f6;hlich et al. (2009)</xref>. Bud surface areas were quantified from confocal stacks according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreira et al. (2009)</xref>. Buds were treated as spheroids, and bright field images capturing the middle of a bud were used to measure bud length (the distance from bud neck to bud tip) and width. Surface area was calculated using S = 2&#x003c0;a<sup>2</sup> + 2&#x003c0;(ab/e)sin<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> e, where a is bud length, b is bud width, and e = [&#x0221a;]1 &#x02212; (b<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup>). The number of GFP patches per bud was determined from 3D reconstructions generated from fluorescent images from the same confocal stacks. The number of patches was plotted against bud surface area and data were fitted using a biphasic model that assumes a lag phase followed by a linear increase of patch number with bud size. The two fitted parameters were the critical bud size for patch formation, which marks the end of the lag phase, and the slope of the subsequent increase. To visualize ergosterol, cells were washed with 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 5.5, stained with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml filipin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min, washed again, and imaged at room temperature with a wide-field microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl Zeiss).</p></sec><sec><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>For regular electron microscopy, strains were grown to early log phase in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium containing 1% dextrose.

In brief, cells were harvested by filtration, rapidly frozen using an EM PACT high-pressure freezer (Leica), freeze substituted in fixative (1% osmium tetroxide, 0.1% uranyl acetate, and 3% water in acetone) using an EM AFS2 freeze substitution system (Leica), and embedded in epon resin. 50&#x02013;90-nm-thin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold&#x02019;s lead citrate, and viewed with a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai 12; FEI). For immunoelectron microscopy, strains were grown to mid-log phase in YPD medium containing 2% dextrose, concentrated by filtration, chemically fixed, treated with periodic acid, embedded in gelatin, and infused with sucrose according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Griffith et al.

Blocks were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and 75-nm-thin cryo-sections were cut with a cryo-ultramicrotome (Ultracut UCT with EM FCS; Leica) at &#x02212;110&#x000b0;C and placed on Formvar-coated nickel grids. For immunolabeling, sections were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (Abcam), followed by incubation with protein A-10 nm gold (CMC, Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht).
