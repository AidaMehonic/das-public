To address this issue, we transformed two different cell lines with shRNA-expressing plasmids, targeting the alpha subunit of AMPK, and verified AMPK&#x003b1; downregulation. The cell lines were then stressed by exposure to medium without glucose (PC12 cells) or with the viral thymidine kinase-specific DNA replication inhibitors: acyclovir, penciclovir and ganciclovir (herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase-expressing Baby Hamster Kidney cells). In non-AMPK-downregulated cells, these stress treatments induced AMPK upregulation and phosphorylation, leaving open the question whether the association of AMPK activation with stress-induced cell death reflects a successful death-promoting or an ineffective death-inhibiting activity. In AMPK&#x003b1;-deficient cells (expressing AMPK&#x003b1;-specific shRNAs or treated with Compound C) exposure to low glucose medium or DNA replication inhibitors led to an enhancement of cell death, indicating that, under the conditions examined, the role of activated AMPK is not to promote, but to protect from or delay stress-induced cell death.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>AICAR</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>glucose</kwd><kwd>ACV</kwd><kwd>PCV</kwd><kwd>GCV</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Two schools of thought have emerged concerning the involvement of the 5&#x02032;AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cell death. One supports the accepted standpoint that AMPK, as a metabolic switch, permits cell survival under conditions of stress. Indeed, Russell <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] report a protective role of AMPK against apoptosis during ischemia and Shaw <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] demonstrate the protective effect of LKB-1 against apoptosis induced by agents that elevate intracellular AMP levels. AMPK has also been reported to promote neuronal and astrocyte survival under conditions which would normally lead to apoptosis [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), an activator of AMPK, has also been reported to inhibit apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>].</p><p>The second school of thought associates AMPK activation with apoptosis, suggestive of a direct role for this enzyme in cell death. Contrasting the reported protective effects of AICAR, Saitoh <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] report that AICAR treatment effects a reduction in gastric cancer cell viability. Further evidence supporting the argument that AMPK activation leads to apoptosis is provided in a study showing that both the AMPK activators, metformin, and AICAR induce &#x003b2; cell apoptosis and that &#x02018;compound C&#x02019;, an inhibitor of AMPK, reduced metformin-induced apoptosis. It was further shown that apoptosis associated with activated AMPK involves JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation and coincides with Caspase-3 activation [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Finally, in a study on AMPK &#x003b2;1 subunit induction in response to treatment with DNA-damaging agents, Li <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] report that AMPK&#x003b2;1 is upregulated during DNA damage-induced apoptosis in a variety of cell lines, that overexpression of AMPK&#x003b2;1 causes growth arrest, and hypothesize that AMPK&#x003b2;1 induction may facilitate cell killing.</p><p>Mammalian AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex comprising a catalytic &#x003b1; subunit and regulatory &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits. Multiple isoforms exist for each subunit (&#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;2, &#x003b3;1, &#x003b3;2, &#x003b3;3) theoretically giving rise to 12 AMPK holoenzymes, differing in subunit isoform combination. Functional properties of the enzyme may also depend on isoform usage, for example, complexes containing the &#x003b1;1 isoform have an exclusively cytoplasmic location and are stimulated to a much lesser extent by AMP than complexes containing the &#x003b1;2 isoform which are predominantly nuclear, suggesting a role for &#x003b1;2 complexes in regulating gene expression [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Phosphorylation (activation) of AMPK occurs at the T172 residue on the &#x003b1; subunit and is promoted by AMP binding. Dephosphorylation (inactivation) of AMPK occurs when the enzyme is bound to ATP instead of AMP. The activation status of AMPK is therefore controlled by the intracellular AMP:ATP ratio, so that if intracellular ATP levels fall, and the ratio shifts in favour of AMP (during stress conditions such as glucose and/or oxygen depletion), the enzyme is predominantly bound to AMP and becomes activated.</p><p>Once activated, AMPK is known to phosphorylate several downstream targets including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, glycogen synthase, phosphofructokinase [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10, 11</xref>] and the transcriptional coactivator p300 [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], with the overall effect of switching off ATP-consuming pathways (such as fatty acid, glycogen and protein synthesis) and switching on ATP-generating pathways (such as glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation). This in turn has the effect of restoring cellular energy levels, which may be important in maintaining cell survival under conditions of stress. However, when cell death is inevitable, AMPK may further be important in influencing whether death occurs via the necrotic or apoptotic route. It is suggested that the downstream controller capable of directing cells towards either necrosis or apoptosis is ATP, based on the accepted hypothesis that apoptosis is an active, energy-requiring process [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref>]. Evidence suggests that, when the cell's ATP levels fall below a critical threshold, apoptosis ensues as long as enough ATP is still available for energy-requiring apoptotic processes. Further falls in ATP levels below the critical threshold result in failure to maintain apoptotic processes and necrosis ensues [<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, as a cell's ATP levels fall below the critical threshold for maintenance of survival, the effect of AMPK activation may be to promote apoptotic, rather than necrotic, death.</p><p>To address the paradox concerning the role of AMPK activation in cell death or survival, we investigated the phosphorylation status of AMPK in two <italic>in vitro</italic> death systems: in herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase-expressing Baby Hamster Kidney (HSVTK<sup>+</sup> BHK) cells, which undergo cell death on treatment with the antiviral guanosine nucleoside analogues acyclovir (ACV), penciclovir (PCV) and ganciclovir (GCV) [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and in PC12 cells exposed to glucose-free medium. In both systems cell death was associated with AMPK activation, and the magnitude of AMPK activation positively correlated with the extent of apoptotic death. Furthermore, transformation of the cells with shRNA-expressing vectors, which downregulated AMPK, resulted in accelerated and enhanced death, indicating that AMPK plays an important role in cell death inhibition under conditions of stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HSVTK-transformed BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

Activated AMPK may diminish apoptotic processes by influencing gene expression, via phosphorylation of transcriptional (co-)activators, or via inhibitory phosphorylation of proteins directly involved in apoptosis. This may have implications in cancer therapy, where specific inhibitors of AMPK might improve the outcome of standard chemotherapy. Here we used two different cell lines and two different cell death models and showed in both cases that AMPK downregulation resulted in enhanced cell death under the stress conditions imposed.</p><p>The first model, in which HSVTK-expressing BHK cells were treated with antiherpesvirus guanosine nucleoside analogues, was originally described by Moolten in 1986 [<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and is employed as a suicide gene therapy approach for treating cancer. The majority of studies confirm that GCV induces apoptotic death in HSVTK-transformed cancer cell lines. Few studies have additionally employed ACV and PCV, probably because GCV is the most effective of these analogues. The pathway of GCV-induced apoptosis in HSVTK-transformed cells is not entirely elucidated. In the BHK cell model described, we confirm Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, accompanied by cell shrinkage, DNA laddering and phosphatidyl serine exposure [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] during both GCV and PCV treatment. However, in this model the cell-killing effect of ACV treatment has always been less potent, appeared to induce sustained cell cycle arrest leading eventually to cell death but did not involve any significant Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, phosphatidyl serine exposure or DNA laddering. In addition we previously reported ACV treatment of HSVTK<sup>+</sup> BHK cells to induce cell swelling, typical of necrosis, rather than the cell shrinkage characteristic of apoptosis. The slowed growth rate associated with AMPK depletion in untreated HSVTK<sup>+</sup> BHK cells might be predicted to render these cells more resistant to guanosine nucleoside analogue-induced death (due to the accompanying reduced rate of DNA replication). However, in the case of GCV and PCV, the AMPK-depleted cells display greater sensitivity to these analogues.</p><p>It is of interest that, while AMPK downregulation enhanced apoptotic death by GCV and PCV treatment, it failed to influence ACV-mediated necrosis. This might be explained by the fact that GCV and PCV-treated cells die by an ATP-dependent mechanism: apoptosis, a pre-requisite for which would be a reduction in ATP levels in order to reach the &#x02018;apoptotic threshold&#x02019;, coupled with sufficient ATP levels to permit the apoptotic process [<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In AMPK-deficient cells, ATP levels are likely to fall faster to the apoptotic threshold resulting in earlier or enhanced induction of apoptosis. ACV-mediated death appears to occur via an ATP-independent mechanism and is therefore less likely to be influenced by reduced AMPK activity.</p><p>In the second model, in which glucose deprivation has been shown to induce apoptosis of PC12 cells [<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19, 20</xref>], we show again that the apoptotic process is enhanced by AMPK depletion. Therefore we tentatively conclude that AMPK depletion may enhance certain apoptotic death processes but is unlikely to influence necrotic processes. Further studies are, however, necessary to establish whether this phenomenon is extendable to the majority of cell types.</p><p>It should be considered, that these studies were carried out on cell types in which, using the Upstate isoform-specific antibodies, only AMPK&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> could be detected. The fact that the AMPK&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-targeted shRNA was able to achieve downregulation of total AMPK&#x003b1; in these cell lines, suggests that the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> sequence may exhibit some cross-specificity, resulting in additional &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> knock-down. (This is conceivable, since the target &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> sequences differ in only one nucleotide.) Since the work was carried out only on &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-expressing cell lines, the apoptosis-enhancing effect of AMPK depletion may be specific only to &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> complexes. We have additionally not investigated &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; isoform usage of the AMPK complexes within these cell types, which may again affect the outcome of the stress-induced cell death process.</p><p>The alternative school of thought supporting a proapoptotic role for activated AMPK is generally supported by observations that the AMPK activator, AICAR, induces apoptosis at concentrations which also induce AMPK phosphorylation. Our study, however, which showed that an shRNA-expressing clone, with no detectable AMPK expression, not only underwent apoptosis on AICAR treatment, but also appeared to be more susceptible, than AMPK-expressing cells, to AICAR-induced death, provides evidence that AICARinduced apoptosis occurs via mechanisms independent of AMPK activation and possibly also that AICARinduced AMPK activation may delay AICAR-induced death. A candidate mechanism by which AICAR may induce cell death, independently of AMPK activation, could be inhibition of DNA synthesis. This is evidenced by the AICAR-induced S-phase accumulation, observed in our cell cycle study, which supports the hypothesis that ZMP, the intracellular monophosphorylated form of AICAR, which mediates AMPK activation, is further converted to ZTP, the triphosphorylated form. dZTP could then interfere in DNA synthesis, resulting in cell death as a result of triggering of DNA damage pathways. The additional reduced levels of AMPK in the AMPK-downregulated clones, might subsequently render them more susceptible to the DNA synthesis-inhibition mechanism of cell death, which would provide an explanation for the AMPK expression- dependent differences in cell viability in the absence of AMPK expression-dependent differences in cell cycle stage accumulations.</p><p>While we provide evidence from these studies, that AMPK depletion enhances stress-induced apoptosis, suggesting that AMPK inhibitors might be beneficial in combination with certain cancer therapies, the additional likelihood that AMPK upregulation/activation may delay stress-induced apoptosis, may be of clinical benefit in reducing damage induced by conditions such as hypoglycaemic shock or stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded in part by a grant from the NIH (DK 20495) and by a mentor fellowship grant from the American Diabetes
