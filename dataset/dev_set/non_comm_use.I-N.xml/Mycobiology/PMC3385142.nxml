A total of four endophytic fungi belonging to Phylum Ascomycetes were isolated from different parts of the plant which were characterized morphologically and by using rDNA-internal transcribed spacer. The most frequently isolated endophyte was <italic>Phomopsis</italic> sp. The antioxidant activity by 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and reducing power assay, and total phenol were evaluated using ethanolic extract of endophytic fungi. DPPH activities in all the ethanolic extract increased with the increase in concentrations. Endophytes, <italic>Phomopsis</italic> sp. and <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. showed highest antioxidant activity and also had the higher levels of phenolics. Antimicrobial activity of fungal extract were tested against four bacteria namely, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MTCC730, <italic>Enteroccocus faecalis</italic> MTCC2729, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> ser. <italic>paratyphi</italic> MTCC735 and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> MTCC1925, and the fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic> MTCC183.

Medicinal plants are reported to harbour endophytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] which in turn provide protection to their host from infectious agents and also provide adaptability to survive in adverse environmental conditions. Metabolites produced by endophytes are being recognized as a versatile arsenal of antimicrobial agents. Endophytic fungi produce a number of substances such as antioxidants, novel antibiotics, antimycotics, immunosuppresants and anticancer compounds, and thus rich source of biologically active metabolites that find wide-ranging exploitation in medicine, agriculture, and industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Investigating the secondary metabolites of microorganisms from unusual or specialized niche may increase the chances of finding novel compounds, as plant endophytes are more subtle, rarely causing problems, coexisting with their hosts under most circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

The crude extract of some fungal endophytes show greater antimicrobial activity compared to others which could be due to their higher efficiency in metabolite production. Vast diversity of microbes remain untapped for structurally diverse metabolites possessing highly valuable bioactivities including antioxidant activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It has been reported that many antioxidants compounds posses anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic, antitumor, anti-mutagenic, anticarcinogenic, antibacterial or antiviral properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the present study, the crude extracts of endophytic fungi showed significant anti-oxidant activities.</p><p>The TPC of the ethanol extract in terms of GAE is indicative of high antioxidant potential of the extract, because the phenolic constituents can react with active oxygen radicals such as lipid peroxy radical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], hydroxyl radical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and superoxide anion radical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In our study, <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. showed the highest phenolic content indicating good antioxidant potential. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] have reported TPC in the range of 54.51 mg/g in intracellular extract of <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. which in our case was 12.5 mg/g. The phenolic compounds in the endophytic fungi may have contributed significantly to their antioxidant activity. The DPPH assay has been largely used as a quick, reliable and reproducible parameter to search the <italic>in vitro</italic> general antioxidant activity of pure compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The lower the IC50 value obtained, the greater is the free radical-scavenging activity. A freshly prepared DPPH solution exhibited a deep purple color which disappears when an antioxidant is present in the medium. Thus, antioxidant molecules can quench DPPH free radicals and convert them to a colorless product, resulting in a decrease in absorbance. The reducing capacity of compounds could serve as indicator of potential antioxidant property [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Considering the total phenolics, reducing power and the DPPH radical scavenging activity as indices of antioxidant activity of the extract, these findings reveal the potential of the extract as a source for natural antioxidants. It indicates that the metabolites of endophytic fungi isolated from <italic>E. officinalis</italic> could be potential agents in scavenging free radicals and treating diseases related to free radical reactions. In accordance with Ohwada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], a comparison of both antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in relation to the amount of total phenolics of different natural extracts certified that a moderate correlation exists between the amount of total phenolics and the biological activity. In this context, the crude extracts of the endophytes, <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. and <italic>Diaporthe</italic> sp. presented a moderate antioxidant activity in the tested concentrations and, overall, a greater antimicrobial activity. The potent antioxidant activity of the ethanolic extract of endophyte supports its possible use as a natural antioxidant in food industries and other pharmaceutical preparations. This work provides an insight into understanding some basis of therapeutic properties of fungal endophytes of <italic>E. officinalis</italic> in traditional medicine. Furthermore, detailed studies on the isolation and characterization of the endophytic fungal metabolites as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> assays will be necessary in discovering new biological antioxidants.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>AN and SRJ acknowledge the financial support received from DBT, Govt of India to carry out the present
