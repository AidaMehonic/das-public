In recent years, the incidence of PH and its associated mortality have increased annually.

Left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac enlargement are common complications. Left ventricular hypertrophy is an important factor in heart failure among PH patients. In the early stage, it influences diastolic function.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Regarding systolic function, recent research has mainly focused on myocardial strain, strain rate and, torsion about the LV.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> There are few investigations of the strain of the subendocardial, middle, and subepicardial myocardial layers.</p><p>A normal myocardium consists of subendocardial, middle, and subepicardial fibers. Torrent-Guasp et al<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> first reported the presence of a so-called myocardial band, and considered that the band consisted of a helix formed by basal and apical loops. The different orientations of the ventricular muscle fibers lead to the spindle-like motions of the heart, similar to the wringing of a rag to squeeze out water.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The muscle fibers of the subepicardial and subendocardial layers are the most longitudinal, and when contracted, they cause longitudinal motion. The fibers of the middle layers are mainly circumferential, and lead to circumferential motion.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> When the myocardial band contracts and relaxes, 3 different motions (longitudinal, circumferential, and radial), result in rotational movement. Because of the particular motion of the heart, there is strain and rotation throughout the cardiac cycles. The strain index can reflect the cardiac function well from the anterior research.</p><p>From the values for E, A, and E/A, we know that in the early stage, the PH patients had diastolic dysfunction.</p><sec><title>Peak Systolic Longitudinal Strain</title><p>The peak systolic longitudinal strain among the myocardial layers in all the groups followed the pattern: subendocardial&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;middle&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;subepicardial (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We consider that this phenomenon is because of the contractual sequence of the muscle fibers during the cardiac cycle. Normal myocardial muscle fibers are longitudinal or circumferential, and the subepicardial and subendocardial layers are oriented longitudinal, whereas the middle layers are circumferential. In patients with high blood pressure, the subendocardial layer is susceptible to ischemia or fibrosis.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> To maintain normal systolic function, the strain is increased. In the current study, we found that the peak systolic longitudinal strain was higher in the LVH group than in the normal and NLVH patients. From this, we could confirm that PH patients with LVH had systolic dysfunction. Although there was no difference in peak systolic longitudinal strain between the NLVH and normal patients, the value of the latter was higher. We consider that in the early stage of PH, systolic function is damaged. We conclude that the peak systolic longitudinal strain can reflect systolic function very conveniently and accurately in PH patients. The longitudinal function was very sensitive to early changes in PH patients.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p>The bull's eyes of the peak systolic longitudinal strain of the normal subjects, NLVH and LVH patients.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-95-e2440-g008"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Peak Systolic Circumferential Strain</title><p>The pattern of peak systolic circumferential strain among the myocardial layers in all patients was middle&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;subepicardial&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;subendocardial. This result is consistent with the muscle fibers, as the middle layers mainly consist of circumferential fibers, so circumferential motion is affected mainly by the middle layers. In the parasternal short axis at the basal level, the peak systolic circumferential strain was similar among the LVH, NLVH, and normal groups. In the parasternal short axis at the middle and apical levels, the pattern was NLVH&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;normal patients&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;LVH. Lorell et al<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> reported that when a heart is under a hemodynamic burden, the heart can use the Frank&#x02013;Starling mechanism, augment muscle mass, and recruit neurohormonal mechanisms to compensate. In our current research, we found that in the early stage of PH (ie, NLVH), the heart appears to normalize systolic function by increasing the circumferential strain. In the LVH stage, the circumferential strain, however, was less, and we conclude that the systolic function was damaged.</p></sec><sec><title>Peak Systolic Radial Strain</title><p>Radial strain had no difference among the 3 groups, but, the radial strain trend was similar between normal patients and NLVH.

We concluded that the systolic function was damaged in LVH patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>LIMITATIONS</title><p>Achieving the study objectives was hampered in that the images were two-dimensional, and when the speckles move out of the plane of the image during the cardiac cycle, they cannot be tracked successfully by the EchoPAC software. The number of the PH patients is small, and long-term analysis with the larger samples is needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our results for the peak systolic longitudinal strain, circumferential strain in the subendocardial, middle, and subepicardial myocardial layers, and peak systolic radial strain indicated that the longitudinal function is very sensitive to early changes in PH patients. Hearts of the PH patients without LVH appeared to compensate for early systolic changes via increased circumferential strain. The radial strain in PH patients with LVH differed in the basal, middle, and apical areas of the parasternal short axis from that of the other 2 groups. We thus conclude that the systolic function is damaged in PH patients. This systolic dysfunction could be detected conveniently and accurately with two-dimensional STE.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CS = The peak systolic circumferential strain; LS = The peak systolic longitudinal strain; LVH = left ventricular hypertrophy; LV = left ventricular or left ventricle; NLVH = non-left ventricular hypertrophy; PH = primary hypertension; RS = The peak systolic radial strain; Two-dimensional STE = two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ganau</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Devereux</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Roman</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
