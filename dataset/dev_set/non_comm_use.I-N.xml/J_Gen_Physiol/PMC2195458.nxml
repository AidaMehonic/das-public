Flavoproteins often show spectroscopically similar intermediates, when partially reduced with substrate. These may, however, be enzyme-product complexes. Detailed investigation of individual flavoprotein enzymes has shown examples in which catalysis involves transition of the enzyme between oxidized and fully reduced forms (glucose oxidase), between oxidized and intermediate forms (<sc>D</sc>-amino acid oxidase), and intermediate and fully reduced forms (TPNH&#x02014;cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase). Further, examples are known in which both intermediate and reduced forms react with oxygen, in which only one reacts, while in TPNH&#x02014;cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase neither the intermediate nor the reduced form reacts with molecular oxygen. The physiological significance of these complex findings is uncertain, partly because it is not known whether purified flavoproteins occur in the same form in the tissues. It seems unlikely, however, that flavoproteins make a major contribution to the respiratory exchange of mammals. </p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
