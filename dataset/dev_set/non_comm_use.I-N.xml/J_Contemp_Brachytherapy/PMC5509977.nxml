It has evolved from the radium era to low-dose-rate (LDR) and now to high-dose-rate (HDR) intensity modulated interventional brachytherapy [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The use of brachytherapy (BT), both in radical setting and as salvage procedure, have resulted in satisfactory outcomes for head and neck malignancies [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Surface mould brachytherapy has shown excellent outcomes using LDR brachytherapy [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. High-dose-rate brachytherapy is now widely used in many parts of the world and has shown to have equivalent outcomes compared to other dose rates for some head and neck malignancies [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There have been few reports regarding the use of SMB in the HDR era for skin malignancies involving skin of face (including nose, pinna) resulting in outcomes comparable with other treatment strategies [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, very limited literature is available for SMB for intra-oral malignancies and involved less number of patients [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This analysis was undertaken to find out the clinical outcomes of superficial tumours of head and neck region treated with SMB, in terms of survival and toxicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><p>Between January 2008 and December 2014, 35 patients were treated with HDR brachytherapy using surface mould. Data was retrieved from prospectively maintained database and patient charts.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Superficial tumours of head and neck region (T1-T2N0 M0) over accessible sites like hard palate, hard-soft palate junction or over the skin like cheek, nose, and ear were considered for treatment with SMB. The decision of treating with SMB was undertaken after reviewing the disease site, and discussing with the medical physicist and mould room technician regarding feasibility of the procedure and possibility of adequate target volume coverage. For patients with primary over hard palate or soft palate, additional consultation with the dental department was done regarding preparation of the dental carrier material.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Procedure</title><p>The workflow of procedure for SMB is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>. Customized mould was made for each patient. Gross tumour with 1 cm margin was considered as the clinical target volume and was marked on the patient. First component of SMB included preparation of the carrier material. The area, over which the cast was to be prepared, was marked over the skin. For tumours located over skin, a negative impression was made using dental alginate material (Alginate Dental Impression Material, The Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Ltd.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2A</xref>). Stone cast or plaster of Paris cast was used to remove the alginate. The negative impression was obtained by removing the assembly after 15 to 20 minutes. The positive cast using stone cast (kalstone) powder was made by filling the hollow of the alginate cast, which was then kept for 10-15 hours. The carrier material (2 mm thick) was made by use of self-curing dental acrylic material to cover the target area and a part of the body contour surrounding it. As per necessities, velcro straps were attached to the carrier for comfortable fitting during treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2B</xref>). For intra-oral tumours, the carrier prosthesis was made using similar procedure of negative and positive cast making in the dental department (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2C</xref>). A dental obturator was made over the positive cast, which was used as a carrier material.</p><fig id="f0001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Workflow of the procedure of surface mould brachytherapy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB-9-29692-g001"/></fig><fig id="f0002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Preparation of carrier material and assembly during treatment in patients treated with surface mould brachytherapy for head and neck cancers. <bold>A)</bold> Application of alginate material over pinna and surrounding region for preparation of the carrier for a patient with basal cell carcinoma of pinna. <bold>B)</bold> The mould with catheters in situ connected to the treatment machine. <bold>C)</bold> Dental impression prepared for a patient with squamous carcinoma of hard palate. <bold>D)</bold> The mould assembly in position for the same patient just prior to treatment delivery</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB-9-29692-g002"/></fig><p>Wax sheets were applied over the carrier material for reinforcement of the catheters to obtain a distance of 5 mm from the surface. Nylon catheters were placed over the wax at a spacing of 10 mm to ensure coverage of the target volume. After the catheters were fixed to the carrier, the entire assembly was tested over the patient for proper fitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Brachytherapy planning and treatment</title><p>Three dimensional computed tomography (CT) based planning was done using thin CT slices of 1 to 1.25 mm slice thickness on Somatom Emotion (Siemens Medical Systems, Germany). To ensure proper visualization, metallic markers or thin copper wires were placed at the edges of the tumour and in the tubes. On the planning scan, the proper fitting of the mould material was verified, and in case of improper fitting with intervening air gaps, repeat images were undertaken or the entire procedure was repeated on some occasions. Planning was done using Oncentra brachytherapy version 3.3 and 4.1 (Nucletron, an Elekta company, Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Catheter reconstruction was done using multiplanar reconstruction, and loading was decided based on the target volume marked on patient. Dose points were defined at 5-7 mm from the source and dose distribution was obtained. Dose point optimization was done for all the patients. Evaluation of the plan was done with slice-by-slice visualization of the target coverage. Dose was prescribed at 100% isodose line in 33 patients and at 85% in 2 patients. Parameters such as V<sub>100</sub>, V<sub>150</sub>, V<sub>200</sub>, and dose homogeneity index (DHI) were evaluated for each patient. In SMB, majority of V<sub>150</sub> and V<sub>200</sub> were observed inside the carrier prosthesis, and hence had little impact on the plan evaluation process. Dose per fraction of 3-4 Gy, twice daily, 6 hours apart was considered. Total dose ranged from 38.5 Gy to 52.5 Gy in 11-15 fractions in radical setting, and 15-30 Gy in 5-10 fractions as boost.</p><p>Radical brachytherapy was considered for tumours of skin and T1 tumours of intraoral region. The aim was to deliver doses of 54-60 Gy equivalent dose of 2 Gy (EQD<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0001">Table 1</xref>). Combined external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and SMB boost was considered in intraoral tumours with T2 lesions. The external beam radiotherapy was considered prior to SMB to a dose ranging from 44 to 60 Gy (median, 50 Gy) at 2 Gy per fraction. In these patients, the aim was to achieve total combined dose of 66-72 Gy EQD<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0001">Table 1</xref>). The appropriate fitting of the mould was verified and presence of airgap checked clinically before each fraction by the treating radiation oncologist.</p><table-wrap id="t0001"

Local recurrence was observed in a single patient with tumour located over the nose. Recurrence was observed 8 months after SMB and was successfully salvaged with surgery. The LC rate in our series is comparable to that of the reported literature. In the series reported by Maronas <italic>et al</italic>., all the 5 patients who had recurred (of total 48), the tumour was located over the nose [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Extra caution is therefore required for treating tumours over nose. In such cases, proper fitting of the carrier material needs to be ensured since chances of missing the target volume exist owing to curved surface.</p><p>With a median follow-up of 52 months, we have observed LC rate of 76% for the intraoral tumours. In 15 patients with hard palate primary, the 5-year control rate was 79% (including 2 treated in recurrent setting). Radical radiotherapy has been reported to result in a 5-year local control of 75% and 79% for T1/T2 lesions of hard palate [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present study, of the 7 patients who had T2 lesion of the hard palate, 3 developed nodal failure, which were seen in ipsilateral level IB and II. These patients were treated with SMB alone. In the series reported by Yorozu <italic>et al</italic>., 5 of 19 SCC patients had developed nodal recurrence subsequently. Similarly, in a series of 17 patients, Mourouzis <italic>et al</italic>. reported 4 nodal failures in hard palate squamous carcinoma for advanced cases [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We suggest elective nodal irradiation for T2 squamous carcinomas of hard palate, and volumes should encompass ipsilateral level IB and II.</p><p>T stage (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04) and dose per fraction (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) were the only 2 factors, which were statistically significant on univariate analysis of LC. T2 tumours had higher failure rates when compared to T1. Local control rates have been reported to be poor with increasing tumour size for nasal skin cancers [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The LC rate for &#x0003e; 3 Gy/fraction was 92%, while it was 50% for 3 Gy per fraction. This could however be due to the fact that &#x0003e; 3 Gy was considered for skin, while 3 Gy was commonly used for intraoral malignancies. Local control was inferior for recurrent tumours but did not reach significance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0003">Table 3</xref>). Similar observation was made by Guix <italic>et al</italic>. where recurrent tumours had performed inferiorly. In the present study, although significant values were not achieved, all the recurrences were seen in squamous carcinoma. In the series by Guix <italic>et al</italic>., the only patient to fail for primary treatment setting was of squamous histology.</p><p>For preparation of the mould, we had used individualized carrier material. The major benefit of such customized mould is proper fitting of the mould, avoiding underdosage due to improper fitting. Similar technique for treatment of skin tumours were adopted by other authors while fixed applicators were used in some studies [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For tumours over palate and tonsil, the preparation of the mould was done in coordination with department of dentistry. Appropriate fitting was confirmed on planning CT scans. Several authors had reported use of similar technique for intra-oral tumours [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In all patients, we have used CT based planning to ensure proper coverage of tumour. Also in few patients, due to improper fitting, the procedure of making the mould was repeated. We suggest careful and meticulous evaluation of the imaging to ensure absence of any air gap between the surface and carrier. The HDR allows the advantage of optimization while planning, and faster treatment delivery. Presently, techniques are under development regarding preparation of computerized 3D mould based on cross sectional imaging. This can be convenient as automated generation and exact reproduction of body contour can possibly lead to better fitting. Clinical outcomes using such techniques are expected to be available in near future.</p><p>The compliance was excellent and all patients completed planned treatment. Of significant late toxicities, asymptomatic palatal perforation (approx. 1 x 1 cm size) was seen in one patient treated for recurrent setting. Patient was asymptomatic and did not require any intervention for the perforation. The other toxicity seen was exposed bone for primary over hard palate. However, there was disease recurrence at the site of initial disease, so more likely it being due to disease process rather than toxicity. Restricting the depth of prescription to 5-7 mm can be postulated as plausible reason for reducing late toxicities in our series. The cosmesis was seen to be excellent for all the patients with few developing minimal hypopigmentation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Surface mould brachytherapy results in excellent LC rates for skin tumours and should be considered as a standard for management of superficial localized head and neck tumours. This technique results in good LC rate in T1 intraoral tumours when considered as radical treatment, while it may be preferable to consider it as a boost for T2 intraoral tumours. Surface mould brachytherapy results in minimal toxicity with excellent cosmesis and function preservation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Presented partly at
