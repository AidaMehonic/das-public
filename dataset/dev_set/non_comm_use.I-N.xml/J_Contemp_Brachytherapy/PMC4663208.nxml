Lesions were located in the pelvis (<italic>n</italic> = 5), extremity (<italic>n</italic> = 2), abdomen/retroperitoneum (<italic>n</italic> = 9), and head/neck (<italic>n</italic> = 2). All cases were performed in conjunction between interventional radiology and radiation oncology. Toxicity was graded based on CTCAE v4.0 and local failure was determined by RECIST criteria. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for LC and overall survival.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>The median follow-up was 11.9 months. Two patients had localized disease at presentation; the remainder had recurrent and/or metastatic disease. Seven patients had prior EBRT, with a median equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD<sub>2</sub>) of 47.0 Gy. The median total EQD<sub>2</sub>s were 34 Gy and 60.9 Gy for patients treated with monotherapy or combination therapy, respectively. Image-guided high-dose rate brachytherapy was delivered in one to six fractions. Six patients had local failures at a median interval of 5.27 months with a one-year LC rate of 59.3% and a one-year overall survival of 40.7%. Six patients died from their disease at a median interval of 6.85 months from the end of treatment. There were no grade &#x02265; 3 acute toxicities but two patients had serious long term toxicities.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrate a good one year LC rate of nearly 60%, and a favorable toxicity profile when utilizing IG-HDR to deliver high doses of radiation with high precision into targets not readily accessible by other forms of local therapy.

While these both offer excellent local control (LC) with acceptable toxicity for appropriately selected patients, there remain scenarios in which achieving LC is challenging. For IR-based ablative techniques these include lesions in close proximity to the vasculature and/or organs-at-risk (OARs) [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and larger lesions [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For EBRT-based ablative techniques, the main limitations are lesion size and proximity to critical OARs [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Image-guided interstitial high-dose-rate (IG-HDR) brachytherapy can overcome some of the limitations of both IR-based and EBRT-based ablative techniques [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. With IG-HDR, a collaborative effort between interventional radiologists and radiation oncologists allows delivery of high doses of radiation via catheters placed directly into the target lesion. The sharp dose gradients and intra-tumoral heterogeneity provided by HDR allows for simultaneous dose-escalation and OAR sparing. There are multiple clinical reports using IG-HDR to treat hepatic lesions [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], recurrent anorectal cancer [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], lung [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], head/neck cancer [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and metastatic melanoma deposits in various locations [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Aside from the latter report, however, other reports on the use of IG-HDR to target a variety of locations in order to provide local control in patients with locally advanced or incurable disease are sparse. We describe the clinical outcomes of a series of 18 patients treated with IG-HDR in a wide variety of disease sites, either in combination with a course of EBRT or as monotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="S0002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Brachytherapy planning and delivery</title><p>An institutional review board waiver was approved prior to conducting the present retrospective study. Eighteen patients treated at the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of California Los Angeles between 2012 and 2014 were identified. All patients were deemed to be inappropriate candidates for a purely interventional radiology-based ablative approach or EBRT approach for the lesion in question. These other approaches were generally deemed inappropriate due to large size of disease and/or proximity to normal organs at risk with the small bowel being the most common limiting organ at risk. Briefly, a team of radiation oncologists and interventional radiologists performed the IG-HDR procedures. Patients were placed under sedation, and both physicians selected the number and trajectory of 15G flexi-guide catheters to be placed into the target under image-guidance (ultrasound, CT, or both). A pre-implantation plan was used for non-abdominal lesions; due to small bowel variation, pre-implantation plans were not used for abdominal lesions. Planning target volumes and OARs were contoured by the radiation oncologist using images obtained from a post-implantation CT simulation scan. Treatment planning was performed using the inverse planning simulation annealing algorithm from Oncentra Brachy Treatment Planning System Version 4.3 (Nucletron, an Elekta company, Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Manual graphical optimization was performed prior to final plan approval. Prescription doses were chosen conservatively on the basis of clinical judgment. Planning was performed with the goal of delivering a dose covering the target being greater than 90% of the prescription dose. Depending on the number of fractions prescribed, the patient either completed treatment later that day or was admitted to the hospital overnight for further fractions the following day. Patients receiving more than one fraction had at least six hours in between treatments. A repeat CT simulation scan was performed prior to each fraction and appropriate catheter adjustments were made as necessary. For the purposes of comparison, an equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD<sub>2</sub>) was calculated for each patient, utilizing the formula EQD<sub>2</sub> = (dose/fraction*number of fractions)*((dose/fraction + &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;)/(2 + &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;)), where &#x003b1;<italic>/</italic>&#x003b2; refers to tumor radiosensitivity and is set to 10 [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S20004"><title>Toxicity and follow-up analysis</title><p>All patients had follow-up imaging with CT or MRI at least three months after treatment, were assessed by a clinician within 12-16 weeks and generally at three month intervals thereafter. Acute toxicity was graded utilizing the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and was derived from a retrospective review of follow-up notes. Chronic toxicities (defined as occurring &#x0003e; 90 days after IG-HDR) were also graded in this fashion. All follow-up dates were measured from the date of IG-HDR. Local control was determined on the basis of RECIST criteria [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] with progressive disease categorized as local failure and all other responses (stable disease and either partial or complete response) treated as LC. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to model LC and overall survival probability.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0005"><title>Results</title><sec id="S20006"><title>Patient and treatment characteristics</title><p>The median clinical follow-up was 11.9 months (range: 4.0-28.5); the median imaging follow-up was 9.15 months (range: 3.5-28.5).

Two patients had grade 3 chronic toxicities; IG-HDR likely contributed but both patients also had bulky local recurrences contributing to their symptoms, and both had prior EBRT.</p><p>Several reports of outcomes following IG-HDR have been reported, primarily with regards to treating hepatic lesions [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], recurrent anorectal cancer [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], lung lesions [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and head/neck cancer [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Series including more heterogeneous populations are limited. Bretschneider <italic>et al</italic>. recently reported the outcomes of 14 patients who received IG-HDR for metastatic melanoma lesions located in the liver, lung, adrenals, lymph nodes, and kidneys [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The median lesion size was 1.5 cm, with a median dose of 19.9 Gy (EQD<sub>2</sub> of 45.9 Gy). They reported a median LC rate of 90% at five months. Image-guided interstitial high dose rate was well-tolerated, with two patients developing small pneumothoraces and one patient developing cholangitis. In general, the average diameter of the lesions treated in our cohort was larger at 5.8 cm (corresponding to an average planning target volume of 93.8 ml), and the average EQD<sub>2</sub> for lesions treated with IG-HDR monotherapy was 36 Gy. Despite these differences, our LC rate of 79% at five months is consistent with the results reported by Bretschneider <italic>et al</italic>. The generally large lesion size and high-risk composition of our cohort could also explain why our one-year LC rate of 59% is slightly lower than the reported results from the other aforementioned IG-HDR series. Our low toxicity rates, on the other hand, are comparable.</p><p>Despite its effectiveness and tolerability in a wide variety of anatomic locations, the optimal indication for IG-HDR remains unclear. Both EBRT and interventional radiology-ablation techniques have been well-studied and afford excellent probabilities of obtaining LC. However, many of the lesions in our series were either close to major vessels, close to other critical structures, and/or had a large diameter &#x02013; all issues that can limit the appropriateness of either EBRT or interventional radiology-ablation techniques [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a recent dosimetric study comparing stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and IG-HDR plans for liver lesions, investigators found that IG-HDR could provide intra-tumoral dose escalation and decreased low dose spill to surrounding tissues [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. On the other hand, for small lesions, SBRT may be preferred. For example, Rwigema <italic>et al</italic>. reported a one-year LC rate of 100% following the use of SBRT for 44 unresectable nodal and soft-tissue oligometatases [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The median gross tumor volume was 18.7 ml, considerably smaller than that in our study. Thus, IG-HDR may be most ideal in situations where other means of obtaining LC are relatively or absolutely contraindicated, as in the case of large lesion and/or lesions in close proximity to critical OARs.</p><p>Because of the small sample size, we did not attempt any statistical test to compare LC probabilities on the basis of anatomic site, EQD<sub>2</sub>, or combination with EBRT vs. IG-HDR alone. It is probable that the relatively improved LC with combination EBRT relates to the fact that most patients treated with IG-HDR alone had relative contraindications to combination EBRT. Further study will be needed to determine the adequate dose and fractionation for IG-HDR cases.</p><p>There are several limitations to this work. First, the treated population is heterogeneous, rendering it difficult to make firm conclusions about the efficacy of IG-HDR. The primary goal of this work was to determine the efficacy and safety of escalated doses of radiation in challenging treatment situations. Second, the employed definition of LC was based upon RECIST classification of treated lesions. Several patients had significant burden of disease and IG-HDR was performed with a goal of symptomatic relief. While at least one follow-up imaging study was required for inclusion in this report, several patients did not obtain further imaging, nor did we feel it was appropriate to request them to do so solely for this study. Thus, it is possible that some patients had LC for a longer interval than was reported here. Conversely, it is possible that post-treatment hyperemia could have obscured the clear identification of a local failure; however, all images were reviewed by radiologists trained in utilizing the RECIST criteria. Additionally, our data appear to show a strong dose-response relationship with higher EQD<sub>2</sub> values associated with improved LC. As a result, one might argue that the patients who experienced poor LC in our study were underdosed. This may indeed be the case; as no clear OAR constraints and IG-HDR dosing guidelines were available for the relevant target locations at the time these patients were treated, doses were often chosen conservatively. Finally, the intention of IG-HDR as described herein is not to supplant other, more commonly used, and widely accessible ablative techniques but rather to provide an option in cases, for which those techniques may not be optimal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0010"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, IG-HDR appears to be an effective and safe joint interventional radiology/radiation oncology technique for achieving LC in patients with complex tumor masses, for which other ablative techniques are relatively contraindicated. Likely candidate lesions will be those that are large and/or in close proximity to critical structures or vessels.</p></sec><sec id="S0011"><title>Disclosure</title><p>Authors report no conflict of
