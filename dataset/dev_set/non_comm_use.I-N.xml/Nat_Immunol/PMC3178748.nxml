Upon antigen engagement, the T cell receptor (TCR) signals T cells activation in cooperation with signals delivered by costimulatory molecules, most importantly CD28 <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into various effector T cells that participate in pathogen clearance either directly or indirectly, by providing help for activation of other immune cells. In contrast to their efficient response to foreign antigens, T cells are normally tolerant to antigens of self-tissues, thus preventing the development of autoimmunity <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. T cell tolerance to self-antigens is controlled by different mechanisms. In addition to the developmental deletion or inactivation of autoreactive T cells by mechanisms of central tolerance <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, peripheral T cells are tightly controlled by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Among the extrinsic factors, T regulatory (Treg) cells suppress na&#x000ef;ve T-cell activation through both physical interaction and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF&#x003b2; and IL-10 <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Intrinsic factors include various molecules that negatively regulate the TCR and CD28 signals <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Thus, autoimmunity may occur due to either Treg defects or impaired negative regulation of TCR-CD28 signaling.</p><p id="P3">Several negative regulators of the TCR-proximal signaling have been described <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, although relatively less is known about the regulation of downstream signaling events. A critical downstream signaling event triggered by the TCR-CD28 signals is activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, a family of transcription factors required for T cell activation and differentiation <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Mammalian NF-&#x003ba;B is composed of five members, RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52, which form various dimeric complexes and transactivate target genes via binding to an enhancer element, &#x003ba;B. In resting T cells, NF-&#x003ba;B proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitory proteins, termed I&#x003ba;Bs. Canonical pathway of NF-&#x003ba;B activation involves phoshorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; by the I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) and subsequent I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation, which triggers the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B dimers. An important NF-&#x003ba;B family member involved in T cell activation is c-Rel, which mediates cytokine production, proliferation, and differentiation of T cells <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Deficiency in c-Rel renders T cells more susceptible to tolerance induction <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. In contrast to the rapid and transient nature of RelA activation, the induction of c-Rel nuclear translocation is delayed and more persistent and critically dependent on CD28 costimulation <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Although RelA is subject to tight control by I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;-mediated feedback regulation, the negative regulation of c-Rel activation remains unclear.</p><p id="P4">Ubiquitination has emerged as a critical mechanism that regulates T-cell activation <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. The Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases mediates lysine (K) 48 ubiquitination and degradation of TCR-proximal signaling factors, thereby negatively regulating T-cell activation <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. On the other hand, ubiquitin ligases that catalyze K63-linked ubiquitin chains mediate IKK activation and positively regulate NF-&#x003ba;B signaling <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. More recently, a new family of E3 ligases, termed Peli (or Pellino), has been shown to catalyze formation of both K63 and K48 ubiquitin chains <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Mammalian Peli family is composed of three members, Peli1, Peli2, and Peli3, which share strong sequence homology and structural domains <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. The E3 ubiquitin ligase function of Peli proteins is dependent on their C-terminal RING domain <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies suggest that Peli proteins interact with IRAK1 and mediate activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and MAP kinases by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. In addition, Peli1 has an essential role in mediating NF-&#x003ba;B activation by TRIF-dependent TLRs, such as TLR3 and TLR4, although Peli1 is dispensable for NF-&#x003ba;B activation by the MyD88-dependent TLRs and IL-1R <sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Since Peli1 possesses both K63 and K48 E3 ligase activities, it remains an intriguing question whether it mediates distinct biological functions.</p><p id="P5">In the present study, we describe a new function of Peli1 in the regulation of T-cell activation and homeostasis. We found that Peli1 serves as a critical negative regulator of T cell activation and prevents the development of autoimmunity. This function of Peli1 is mediated through targeting c-Rel for K48 ubiquitination and degradation. <italic>Peli1</italic> deficiency does not affect the activation of IKK but causes accumulation of nuclear c-Rel in the activated T cells. Consequently, the Peli1-deficient T cells are hyperresponsive to TCR-CD28 stimulation, and the <italic>Peli1</italic> knockout (KO) mice develop autoimmunity. These data establish Peli1 as a critical factor that controls T cell homeostasis and peripheral tolerance and highlight a novel mechanism of c-Rel regulation. Since Peli1 does not effect upstream TCR signaling, it may be exploited as a therapeutic target for manipulating T cell responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Peli1 is a negative regulator of T cell activation</title><p id="P6">As an approach to assess the physiological functions of Peli1, we searched for its expression profile in the BioGps database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.gnf.org">http://biogps.gnf.org</ext-link>). <italic>Peli1</italic> showed abundant expression in lymphocytes, and neither <italic>Peli2</italic> nor <italic>Peli3</italic> displayed such an expression pattern.

Furthermore, in contrast to the hyper-activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, the activation of another T-cell transcription factor, AP-1, was largely normal (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), thus suggesting a specific role for Peli1 in the control of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. Similar results were obtained using purified CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> and data not shown).

Moreover, Peli1 knockdown led to a marked enhancement in c-Rel activation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>), while overexpression of Peli1 in EL4 cells inhibited the activation of c-Rel (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>).

Collectively, these results demonstrate a role for Peli1 in regulating c-Rel activation by TCR and CD28 signals.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Peli1 mediates K48 ubiquitination of c-Rel</title><p id="P21">A previous study reported that c-Rel undergoes ubiquitination and degradation in leukemia T cell lines with constitutive NF-&#x003ba;B signaling <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. To examine whether TCR plus CD28 signals induce the ubiquitination of c-Rel and whether this event is regulated by Peli1, we stimulated T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies and then incubated them with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to block degradation of ubiquitinated c-Rel. In wild-type T cells, c-Rel was ubiquitinated in response to TCR plus CD28 stimulation (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). Because the accumulation of ubiquitinated c-Rel was detected only in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, it is likely that c-Rel undergoes ubiquitin-dependent degradation in activated T cells. However, the induction of c-Rel ubiquitination was largely blocked in the <italic>Peli1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). These results suggest the involvement of ubiquitination in the regulation of c-Rel during normal T-cell activation and establish Peli1 as an essential E3 that mediates c-Rel regulation.</p><p id="P22">We further examined if a physical interaction occurred between Peli1 and c-Rel. Endogenous Peli1 and c-Rel were co-precipitated by an anti-Peli1 antibody but not by a pre-immune serum (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>), suggesting the two proteins interact in T cells. A stronger binding of c-Rel to Peli1 was detected in CD3 plus CD28-stimulated T cells, probably due to the increase in c-Rel and Peli1 protein levels. In HEK293 cells transfected with the two proteins, Peli1 bound to c-Rel and the C-terminal RING domain of Peli1 was dispensable for this association (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Moreover, Peli1 expression in HEK293 cells led to potent induction of c-Rel ubiquitination (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). Since the ubiquitin ligase function of Peli1 requires its C-terminal RING domain, a Peli1 mutant lacking its C-terminal region (Peli1&#x00394;C) largely lost its ability to induce c-Rel ubiquitination (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>), despite its ability to bind c-Rel (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). Similar results were obtained with a T cell line, EL4 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). The defective c-Rel ubiquitination by Peli1&#x00394;C was consistent with the inability of Peli1&#x00394;C to inhibit c-Rel activation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Since Peli1 is able to catalyze both K48-and K63-linked ubiquitin chains <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, we examined whether Peli1-induced c-Rel ubiquitination involved K63-or K48-linked ubiquitination chains by employing ubiquitin mutants harboring K to R mutations at K63 (K63R) and K48 (K48R). Whereas the K63R ubiquitin mutant was competent in mediating Peli1-stimulated c-Rel ubiquitination, the K48R ubiquitin mutant was defective in this modification (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>). This result was not due to the differential expression of these ubiquitin mutants (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>).

In the present study, we show that Peli1 is unique in its high levels of expression in lymphocytes and that it plays an important role in the negative regulation of T-cell activation and maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance. In contrast to its role in TLR signaling, Peli1 is largely dispensable for activation of IKK by TCR signals, but mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of c-Rel. <italic>Peli1</italic>-deficient T cells are hyper-responsive to TCR and CD28 stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic> and display an activated phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>, and <italic>Peli1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice develop severe autoimmune symptoms. Although a previous work suggests c-Rel constitutive ubiquitination in transformed T-cell lines <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, whether this event occurs inducibly during normal T-cell activation has remained unknown. Our work not only identified Peli1 as a c-Rel ubiquitin ligase but also demonstrated ubiquitin-dependent degradation of c-Rel as a mechanism to negatively regulate T-cell activation.</p><p id="P25">The opposing functions of Peli1 in TLR and TCR signaling pathways are intriguing. However, similar functions have been reported for another E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRAF6. Like Peli1, TRAF6 functions as a negative regulator in T cells, but has a positive role in regulating TLR signaling <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Precisely how TRAF6 negatively regulates T cell activation is unclear, but TRAF6-deficient T cells have higher Akt activation <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Our current study revealed that the negative role of Peli1 in T cell activation is not due to IKK hyper-activation but rather involves accumulation of a specific NF-&#x003ba;B protein, c-Rel. Our data suggested that Peli1 mediates K48 ubiquitination of Peli1, in agreement with previous studies showing that Peli1 can catalyze both K48 and K63-linked ubiquitin chains <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Dual specificity in ubiquitin chain conjugation has been reported for several other E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;TrCP</sup>, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, and Parkin <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. It remains to be investigated whether Peli1 mediates K48 ubiquitination of additional targets.</p><p id="P26">T cell activation requires both TCR and CD28 co-stimulatory signals, and stimulation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells in the absence of the CD28 signal leads to T cell anergy <sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Accumulating evidence suggests that c-Rel is a critical factor that integrates the TCR and CD28 signals and mediates T cell activation. c-Rel activation is strictly dependent on the CD28 signal <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and c-Rel is a major transcription factor that binds to the CD28-responsive element in the promoter region of IL-2 and other T-cell cytokine genes <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Indeed, c-Rel is required for both the initial activation and subsequent differentiation of T cells <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Moreover, c-Rel deficiency renders T cells sensitive to tolerance induction and prevents the development of autoimmune inflammation <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Consistent with these previous studies, we found that the hyper-activation of c-Rel in <italic>Peli1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells is associated with aberrant T cell activation. In contrast to the requirement for TCR and CD28 co-stimulation for normal T cell activation, <italic>Peli1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells could be activated by the TCR signal in the absence of CD28 co-stimulation. Thus, Peli1, likely through regulating the magnitude of c-Rel activation, controls the threshold of T cell response and maintains the requirement of CD28 co-stimulation, a mechanism that may contribute to prevention of autoimmunity.</p><p id="P27">We found that <italic>Peli1</italic>-deficient na&#x000ef;ve T cells were less susceptible than control T cells to Treg-mediated suppression. These mutant T cells also displayed a high level of resistance to TGF&#x003b2;-mediated suppression. This functional phenotype may be due to the hyper-activation of <italic>Peli1</italic>-deficient T cells, because similar phenotypes have been seen with T cells lacking other negative regulators <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. T cells with hyper-active NF-&#x003ba;B, due to the lack of the I&#x003ba;B-like molecule p105, are also resistant to Treg-mediated suppression <sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>.

<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>T cells to Treg- and TGF&#x003b2;-mediated suppression. Of course, our data do not exclude the possible involvement of Peli1 in an additional mechanism of T cell regulation.</p><p id="P28">In summary, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Peli1 is a novel negative regulator of T cell activation, which contributes to the maintenance of peripheral T cell tolerance. Our data suggest that Peli1 mediates K48 ubiquitination of c-Rel, which appears to prevent aberrant accumulation of this key NF-&#x003ba;B factor during T-cell activation. This is in line with its abundant expression in T cells. Thus, despite their structural homology, the Peli family members possess non-redundant functions, probably due to their differential profile of expression. Our current findings further emphasize the importance of E3 ubiquitin ligases in the regulation of immune tolerance and establish Peli1 as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of immunological disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S12"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S13"><title>Mice</title><p id="P29"><italic>Peli1</italic> KO mice (in C57BL/6x129/sv genetic background) were described <sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.
