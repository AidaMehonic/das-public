This is a unique study from the Arab Middle East to describe the epidemiologic characteristics and outcomes of a nationally representative population of pTBI classified by age group. There are several key findings in this study. First, one out of every six victims of TBI in Qatar is a child. Second, the leading mechanism of injury and outcomes of pTBI are age-dependent. Third, the most affected group is teenagers (40%) followed by infants/toddlers (23%). Fourth, two thirds of the cohort has severe pTBI. Fifth, males predominate among the victims but the gender difference is narrowing.</p><p id="Par19">Eighteen percent of all TBI in Qatar, during the study period, were children, and according to the Qatar Statistics Authority, 18% of the population of Qatar are children, aged 18&#x000a0;years or younger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This denotes that children in Qatar do not bear a disproportionate risk for TBI, but at the same time, they are not more protected than adults from TBIs. An analysis of the leading age group-dependent mechanisms of injury, that cause pTBI in Qatar, will inform the creation of focused efforts to prevent these pTBIs.</p><p id="Par20">There are few published studies on pTBI from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries including Qatar. In 2012, Hefny et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reviewed the pediatric trauma research in the GCC and demonstrated a pediatric trauma publication rate of 0.16 publications per 100,000 populations. We have observed a high age-specific incidence and mortality in pTBI cases mainly involving teenagers and infants/toddlers. The mean age of pTBI cases in our study was 10&#x000a0;years which is similar to a recent study from a neighboring larger country (Saudi Arabia) with an average age of 8.6&#x000a0;years for pTBI admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The present study estimates the hospitalization rate of pTBI to be 9.5 cases per 100,000 children per year, which ranges between 5 and 14 cases per 100,000 children per year. A recent study from Qatar reported the incidence of severe pediatric trauma to be 163 per 280,000 children (&#x02264;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years) who visited ED per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A previous report from our center identified that 28% of the TBI patients were under the age of 20&#x000a0;years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">MVCs were the leading cause of pTBI in our study, accounting for 77.3% of the pTBIs in the 15&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years old group. A similar figure was reported in the Saudi Arabia (74.4%) for high school students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In our series, the 57% ejection (from the vehicles) rate are inversely proportional to the 5% rate of seatbelt use. A recent publication from our center demonstrated that the underutilization of seatbelt among young vehicle occupants is associated with ejection and higher morbidities and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It has been estimated that seatbelt compliance could possibly result in twofold reduction in severe injury and fourfold reduction of mortality among MVC victims. Grivna et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] reported 24% fatality among unrestrained adolescent (10&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years) drivers in the UAE. A cross-sectional survey conducted in Kuwait revealed the limited knowledge about child car safety among the parents. Nearly two out of five participants have either seated a child in the front seat or on their lap while driving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A roadside survey, conducted outside nurseries in Qatar, observed a 38% appropriate utilization with an almost equal 41% incorrect utilization of car seats for children under 5&#x000a0;years. Additionally, 11% of the more than 2000 children observed were improperly seated, unrestrained, and in the front seat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this study, a higher proportion of injured infants/toddlers, 37.5%, were occupying the front seat of the vehicle, a clear violation of Qatar traffic regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This finding highlights the need for more consistent enforcement of the existing laws on child passenger safety and the expansion of these laws that require the use of restraints for all vehicle passengers, children, and adults in all seating locations.</p><p id="Par22">All Terrain Vehicle (ATV)-related pTBIs were most common among adolescents, 10&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years, in our study, which is in line with a previous study on recreational-related injuries from Qatar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this study, bicycle-related pTBI was most common in young children, 5&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years, and the use of helmet was not reported or documented in any. These recreational or sports-related pTBIs among younger children 14&#x000a0;years and under are a call for the widespread education in bicycle and ATV safety in schools and the creation and enforcement of laws requiring the use of helmets and safety gear for all bicycle and ATV users.</p><p id="Par23">During the study period, we noted that the rate of pTBI increased more than the double, from 5.1 to 13.8 cases per 100,000 children per year with a slight decrease in the year 2014. Whether this decrease is sustained will be the subject of future research.</p><p id="Par24">Eighty percent of our pTBI patients were males, and the incidence rate of male pTBI was fourfold higher than females. Similarly, an over-representation of males was also observed in studies from KSA and UAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The initial gender discrepancy could be partly explained by differential risk exposure which in our study was underage driving by young males. This risk factor has been previously identified and has been the focus of concerted efforts by multi-disciplinary stakeholder groups, but it still remains as a priority area for road safety in Qatar.</p><p id="Par25">The present study shows a frequent association of fall-related pTBI among infants/toddlers which is consistent with an earlier study from Qatar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Studies from Saudi Arabia reported fall to be the most common mechanism for pTBI among children of age less than 6&#x000a0;years (45.6%) and in the age up to 3&#x000a0;years (34%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Also, our findings showed that pedestrians constituted 11% of total pTBI victims, and the highest association was observed in the young age group (5&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years). Similarly, Grivna et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] showed that 15% of pTBI involved pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions mainly expatriates of age less than 10&#x000a0;years. Another study from KSA reported a higher frequency of pedestrian (30.3%) sustained pTBI from major trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">In our study, the CFR was higher in infants/toddlers (20.5%) and adolescents (13.8%). An earlier study from KSA reported a similar mortality rate (20%) in late adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The most fatal mechanism of injury in our study was pedestrian hit by motor vehicle. Further investigation is required in this area using larger sample size.</p><p id="Par27">Creating injury prevention programs to specifically prevent pTBIs must begin with specific evidence on the leading mechanism of disease for each age group. This allows for the application of interventions that are not only proven to work but also appropriate for the developmental stage of the child at risk. A description of the age-specific patterns of road traffic injuries in children in Qatar has been previously presented, and this study further adds to the evidence for child injury programs.</p><p id="Par28">Based on this study, families with infants and young toddlers, 0&#x02013;4&#x000a0;years of age, should be the beneficiary of education and information campaigns to increase knowledge on ways to improve home safety, to prevent pTBIs from falls and falling objects, and road safety to increase child restraint use and pedestrian safety. For families with older children, 5&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years, the highest risks for pTBI come from falls, pedestrian injuries, and from the precocious use of the road as pedestrians, cyclists, and ATV riders. Adolescents could be the beneficiary of school-based education in almost all aspects of safe road use, especially as ATV drivers, and the tighter enforcement of the minimum age for driving in Qatar, 18&#x000a0;years and above. Lastly, teenagers must pass through graduated driver licensing programs, the only proven means of reducing their risk from pTBI as drivers. Untested driver education programs must not be implemented as they have actually been proven to increase the odds of young driver involvement in MVCs.</p><p id="Par29">The educational and awareness campaigns must not be limited only to parents but to also include all the caregivers, especially for the younger age groups who are under the supervision of nannies and/or day care center staff. The creation and consistent enforcement of restraint laws for passengers of all ages will be instrumental in reducing the unnecessary toll from pTBIs in Qatar. Lastly, we urge that multi-disciplinary injury prevention programs be implemented and evaluated to reduce pTBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

</p><p id="Par30">A potential limitation of this study is the retrospective design. Our registry does not capture comprehensive information on the crash details, height of fall, site of injury and detailed restraint use. Also, we may underestimate the health burden from pTBI as it does not include patients who died at the scene, child abuse, long-term outcomes, and quality of life. The sample size was not prespecified as we intended to enroll all the patients &#x02264;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years old who sustained TBI and required admissions. Selection bias was minimized as HGH is the tertiary hospital that deal with significant TBI; however, excluding patients who were not admitted might carry this bias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par31">The present study addresses the local burden of pTBI which could be the basis to develop efficient, tailored strategies and interventions for the community safety in our region.
