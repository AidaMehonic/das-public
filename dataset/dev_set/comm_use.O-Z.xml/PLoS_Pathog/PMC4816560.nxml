MR1 is a highly conserved Class I-like molecule that presents vitamin B metabolites to MAIT cells. The mechanisms for loading these ubiquitous small molecules are likely to be tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate MAIT cell activation. To define the intracellular localization of MR1, we analyzed the distribution of an MR1-GFP fusion protein in antigen presenting cells. We found that MR1 localized to endosomes and was translocated to the cell surface upon addition of 6-formyl pterin (6-FP). To understand the mechanisms by which MR1 antigens are presented, we used a lentiviral shRNA screen to identify trafficking molecules that are required for the presentation of Mtb antigen to HLA-diverse T cells. We identified Stx18, VAMP4, and Rab6 as trafficking molecules regulating MR1-dependent MAIT cell recognition of Mtb-infected cells. Stx18 but not VAMP4 or Rab6 knockdown also resulted in decreased 6-FP-dependent surface translocation of MR1 suggesting distinct pathways for loading of exogenous ligands and intracellular mycobacterially-derived ligands. We postulate that endosome-mediated trafficking of MR1 allows for selective sampling of the intracellular environment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Tuberculosis, caused by the bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), remains a global health concern, with an estimated 9 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths each year. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells were recently identified as a non-classical CD8+ T cell subset that responds to intracellular infection with Mtb and other microbes. MAIT cells recognize vitamin B metabolites presented on the Class I like molecule, MR1. MAIT cell recognition is likely to be tightly regulated to allow for the detection of intracellular infection while avoiding tissue damage. In this manuscript, we have characterized the intracellular localization and trafficking of MR1 at basal conditions and in the presence of a known ligand. Furthermore, we have investigated the role of intracellular trafficking in MR1 presentation of ligands to MAIT cells in the context of intracellular infection with Mtb. We show that, in contrast to other Class I molecules, MR1 resides in endosomal compartments and translocates to the cell surface in the presence of ligand. We went on to identify trafficking molecules that are required for the presentation of Mtb antigen to HLA-diverse T cells, and found at least seven trafficking molecules that are specifically involved in regulating MR1-dependent recognition of human MAIT cells. Among these, we show that Syntaxin 18 (Stx18), vesicle-associated membrane protein 4 (VAMP4), and Rab6 play distinct roles in the trafficking of MR1<sup>+</sup> endosomal compartments. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that exogenously added ligands and those derived during intracellular infection are presented through different mechanisms. Our results provide a conceptual framework underlying the regulation of MAIT cell activation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by Career Development Award #IK2 CX000538 from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Clinical Sciences Research and Development Program (MJH) and in part by Merit Award #I01 BX000533 from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development Program (DML).

In support of a role for these cells in host-defense to mucosal infection, human MAIT cells are present in high numbers in mucosal tissues and blood [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and secrete pro-inflammatory molecules including TNF&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

Although MR1 is ubiquitously expressed in all mammalian tissues examined, surface expression is very low or undetectable in both phagocytic professional antigen presenting cells and non-hematopoetic cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previous work demonstrated that MR1 surface expression in mouse cells overexpressing MR1 requires both the MHC-II chaperone, invariant chain (Ii), and trafficking through late endosomal compartments [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is in contrast to the constitutive surface expression of other Class I molecules, and may be key to understanding the regulation of MR1-restricted MAIT cell activation.</p><p>The McCluskey and Rossjohn groups have identified Vitamin B metabolites as ligands that bind and stabilize MR1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. With regard to MAIT cell activation, pterins, which are derived from folic acid (6-formylpterin (6-FP and ac-6-FP)), are antagonistic, while the bacterially-derived riboflavin metabolites known as lumazines (RL-6,7-diMe, RL-6-Me-7-OH, and rRL-6-CH<sub>2</sub>OH) are agonists [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. More recently an additional class of ligands, pyrimidines (5-OE-RU, 5-OP-RU), were identified as potent activators of MAIT cells. These pyrimidines are generated in a chemical reaction between bacterially-derived riboflavin precursor molecules and small metabolites derived from either the host or pathogen [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Currently, little is known about the intracellular localization of MR1, how and where MR1 is loaded with these ligands, or the mechanism for MR1 translocation to the cell surface. The ubiquitous expression of MR1 in many tissues, the high frequency of MAIT cells in both the blood and mucosal tissues, and the prevalence of potentially activating ligands likely requires that MR1 loading and trafficking be tightly regulated to prevent indiscriminant MAIT cell activation. Although Ii was proposed as a required chaperone for MR1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we have demonstrated that airway epithelial cells (AEC) are highly efficient at presenting antigen to MAIT cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] even though they do not express MHC class II or Ii. The ability of AEC to efficiently present mycobacterial antigens and their proximity to MAIT cells in the lung suggests they may play an important role in early recognition of exposure to Mtb or other pathogens. In this study, we sought to define intracellular trafficking pathways necessary for the presentation of Mtb-derived MR1 ligands by AEC to human MAIT cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>MR1 localizes to vesicular compartments with late endosome and lysosome markers</title><p>To determine the basal intracellular localization of MR1 in AEC, we expressed MR1 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the BEAS-2B airway epithelial cell line and primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE).

We next sought to define the subcellular localization of MR1-GFP using high-resolution deconvolution microscopy. As expected, in both BEAS-2B and NHBE cells, the majority of MR1 observed was intracellular, with expression in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like subcellular compartment as well as endosomal compartments (EC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005524.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005524.s001">S1 Movie</xref>).

Staining with antibodies against the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC-53) the trans-Golgi network (TGN-46) demonstrated that a proportion of the MR1-GFP localized to these compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005524.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), while subsets of the MR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> EC co-localized with markers that define late endosomes or lysosomes (Rab7, Lamp1) but not early endosomes (Rab5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005524.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005524.s002">S2 Movie</xref>).

To define this mechanism in the context of intracellular infection with a pathogen, we designed a screen to identify trafficking proteins that are essential for MR1-dependent MAIT cell activation in the setting of intracellular infection with Mtb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005524.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). Here, shRNA knockdown of trafficking molecules in BEAS-2B cells expressing native MR1 was performed, and T-cell dependent release of IFN-&#x003b3; was measured following Mtb infection. To identify MR1-specific mechanisms, human Mtb-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones of known specificity (MR1 (D426 B1), HLA-E (D160 1&#x02013;23), and HLA-B45 (D466 D6)) were tested in parallel with the same Mtb-infected APC. Candidate proteins were identified by the selection criteria described in the Materials and Methods. Briefly, to reduce the impact of non-specific shRNA targeting, genes where at least two independent shRNAs resulted in reduced T cell recognition were considered candidates for subsequent siRNA validation. Based on these criteria, we identified candidate genes that fell into three categories with regard to recognition by MAIT cells: 1) Genes where silencing did not result in reduced recognition by any of the T cell clones; 2) Genes where silencing resulted in reduced recognition by all of the T cell clones; and 3) Genes where silencing resulted in reduced recognition specifically by MAIT cells.

There is a growing appreciation for the importance of these cells in the mucosal response to intracellular microbial infection. At present, little is known about the mechanisms by which this novel class of antigens are processed and presented. As we have demonstrated previously, MAIT cells recognize Mtb-infected dendritic and epithelial cells and are present in high numbers in lung tissues [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We postulate that the circumstances by which MAIT cells become activated is tightly regulated to allow for the recognition of intracellular infection while avoiding tissue damage. Here we have demonstrated that MR1 is primarily localized to an endosomal compartment, and have identified trafficking molecules responsible for presentation of Mtb antigens on MR1. These results provide a framework with which to understand the mechanisms regulating activation of MAIT cells.</p><p>While we and others have shown that exogenous ligands such as the short-lived ribityllumazine metabolites can be presented in the context of MR1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, the extent to which exogenous ligands contribute to MAIT cell activation <italic>in vivo</italic> is unknown. Our data support the hypothesis that regulation of MAIT cell activation is critically dependent on intracellular infection. Cell-surface localization of classical Class I molecules is dependent on binding by a peptide that can be either endogenous or exogenous. This is in contrast to MR1, which we demonstrate is primarily localized to endosomal compartments with features of late endosomes and lysosomes, consistent with previous findings in mouse embryonic fibroblasts [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The difference in intracellular localization between classical Class I molecules and MR1 suggest that translocation to the cell surface is a key event for MAIT cell recognition of intracellular infection. By maintaining a dynamic endosomal store of MR1, ligands derived from intracellular pathogens can be rapidly loaded and presented on the cell surface. MR1 that does not encounter intracellular ligand may be rapidly recycled or degraded, keeping access to ligands from normal extracellular gut flora to a minimum. These findings led us to explore the role of endosomal trafficking in presentation of Mtb ligands on MR1 to MAIT cells.</p><p>Using lentiviral shRNA knockdown in Mtb-infected APC, we identified a set of trafficking molecules specifically involved in the presentation of MR1-ligands to MAIT cells. Our results lead us to postulate a model where, in contrast to classical ER-associated Class I antigen processing and presentation, the expression of MR1 in endosomal compartments is critical to regulation of the processing and presentation of MR1 ligands generated in the context of intracellular infection with Mtb. In this model, we seek to explain 1) the proteins involved in generation of MR1<sup>+</sup> EC, 2) the location where MR1 interacts with ligand, and 3) the ability of loaded MR1 to translocate to the cell surface. While we cannot yet say where MR1 is interacting with Mtb ligand based on our data, we can conclude that MR1 is likely interacting with exogenously added ligands such as 6-FP primarily in a pre-Golgi compartment such as the ER. We have identified proteins, Stx18, VAMP4, and Rab6, which play a role in maintaining the structure of the TGN, and ultimately regulate the translocation of MR1 to the cell surface in the context of infection with Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005524.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In the context of our model, 6-FP is loaded through a distinct pathway from those derived in the context of intracellular infection. The ER-associated SNARE, Stx18, appears to play a role in both of these pathways, whereas the TGN-endosome localized Rab6 and VAMP4 uniquely contribute to the loading of Mtb ligands. These data support a role for the MR1<sup>+</sup> EC in loading of Mtb ligands.</p><fig id="ppat.1005524.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005524.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Model of MR1 trafficking.</title><p>Our data support the hypothesis that the primary MR1 presentation pathway for exogenous ligands like 6-FP is through the ER.

At present, there are three ways in which the immune system is known to sample the endosomal environment, both of which involve exchange of ligand. The first is through MHC Class II antigen presentation, where peptides derived from the endosomal pathway are exchanged with the invariant chain (Ii) on MHC Class II molecules in a late endosomal compartment known as the MHC Class II compartment (MIIC) (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). The second is through the MHC Class I endosomal recycling pathway, where MHC Class I molecules are loaded with endosomally-derived peptides through the action of cathepsins and peptide exchange [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The third is through CD1 antigen presentation, where lipid antigens can be sampled in early and late endosomes, including the MIIC (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Unlike MHC-II, classical MHC-I, and CD1 molecules, neither self-ligands nor chaperones have been defined for MR1. Although invariant chain (Ii) was proposed as a required chaperone for MR1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we showed that BEAS-2B cells are highly efficient at presenting antigen to MAIT cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] even though they do not express MHC class II or Ii. Based on this, we hypothesize that there are chaperones in addition to Ii that are able to stabilize MR1 and contribute to endosomal loading of antigen.</p><p>Peptide-loaded classical Class I molecules translocate to the cell surface regardless of whether they contain endogenous or exogenous peptides. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells sample all peptides that are presented, and the ability of T cells to discriminate self from non-self is determined by the specificity of the T cell receptor (TCR). Here, constitutive cell surface localization of classical Class I molecules does not lead to indiscriminant T cell activation as thymic selection serves to remove T cells that are auto-reactive. For MAIT cells, the TCR appears to have broader reactivity from that of classical CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Instead, recognition by MAIT cells may be dependent on the regulated intracellular loading of ligand that in turn leads to cell surface translocation. In support of the idea that stable expression of MR1 on the cell surface is tightly regulated, we observe that even the presence of intracellular infection with Mtb or incubation with soluble fractions from Mtb, there is little to no increase in the level of surface MR1 despite clear activation of MAIT cells. Similarly, translocation of MR1 to the cell surface in the context of bacterial ligands was not observed with soluble fractions from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005524.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], suggesting a common regulatory pathway.</p><p>Mtb-derived MR1 ligands have not yet been identified, and we are not able to track the known small molecule ligands directly in cells. We show clear evidence, however, that trafficking of MR1 in endosomal compartments is key to Mtb antigen presentation, and hypothesize that the regulation of endosomal trafficking is key to generation of MR1<sup>+</sup> EC that can encounter Mtb ligands and subsequently traffic to the cell surface. Further characterization of targets identified in this study will provide insight into the novel regulation of loading of ligand on MR1 and translocation of MR1 to the cell surface in the context of infection. The clear demonstration of endosomal trafficking as essential in the MR1-dependent activation of MAIT cells suggests a different paradigm for how MAIT cell recognition occurs and provides a critical first step in defining the fundamental mechanisms for MR1 antigen processing and presentation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Bacteria and cells</title><p>

After 24 hours the media was removed and replaced with 10ul virus and 40ul media containing 8ug/ml polybrene and the plate was centrifuged at 2200 rpm for 90 min at 37&#x000b0;C. After centrifugation, the media was replaced with 100ul fresh DMEM+10%FBS.

Treated cells were infected with H37Rv Mtb (MOI:30) for 18 hours. Following infection, cells were harvested and divided into four parts, one for counting and three for ELISPOT assays as described below. To count the relative number of cells per well, samples were fixed, combined with a fixed number of latex beads, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Wells that contained fewer than 20 cells per 10,000 latex beads were excluded from analysis as APCs from these wells did not elicit IFN&#x003b3; response above background.

Each plate of shRNAs was assayed independently three times with each of the three T cell clones. Prism (GraphPad) was used for data analysis. Each well was given a rank value based on the relative number of cells and the rank was plotted in ascending order in relation to the number of spots per well. A linear regression analysis was performed to generate a best-fit line with 95% confidence intervals.

MR1 was first amplified by PCR so that an EcoRI site was integrated into the N-terminal end of the amplicon and a 25 bp overlap with the sequence for the following eGFP amplicon was added to the C-terminus (Primers: MR1_FW and MR1_RV). eGFP was then amplified out of a stock plasmid in our lab with a QGGGGFE flexible linker added to the N-terminus and a KpnI restriction site added to the C-terminal of the amplicon (Primers: QGGGGFE eGFP_FW and QGGGGFE eGFP_RV). The gel-purified MR1 and eGFP amplicons were then amplified in a PCR reaction using the MR1 amplicon as a mega-primer for the reaction. Following PCR purification (Qiagen cat. 28104) of the MR1 eGFP amplicon, an additional PCR reaction was run using primers initiating amplification from each terminal end of the template (MR1_FW and QGGGGFE eGFP_RV). Following gel purification (Qiagen cat. 28704), the 1.8kb MR1 eGFP insert was cloned into the pCI mammalian expression vector (Promega Cat. E1731) using EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites. Confirmatory sequencing of our construct revealed a missense mutation (A116G) within the Origene MR1 sequence that changed the coding for amino acid 39 from histidine to arginine.
