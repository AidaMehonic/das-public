<italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis,</italic> an obligatory intracellular rickettsial pathogen, enters and replicates in monocytes/macrophages and several non-phagocytic cells. <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> entry into mammalian cells is essential not only for causing the emerging zoonosis, human monocytic ehrlichiosis, but also for its survival. It remains unclear if <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> has evolved a specific surface protein that functions as an &#x02018;invasin&#x02019; to mediate its entry. We report a novel entry triggering protein of <italic>Ehrlichia,</italic> EtpE that functions as an invasin. EtpE is an outer membrane protein and an antibody against EtpE (the C-terminal fragment, EtpE-C) greatly inhibited <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> binding, entry and infection of both phagocytes and non-phagocytes. EtpE-C-immunization of mice significantly inhibited <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> infection. EtpE-C-coated latex beads, used to investigate whether EtpE-C can mediate cell invasion, entered both phagocytes and non-phagocytes and the entry was blocked by compounds that block <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> entry. None of these compounds blocked uptake of non-coated beads by phagocytes. Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that DNase X, a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored mammalian cell-surface protein binds EtpE-C. This was confirmed by far-Western blotting, affinity pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence labeling, and live-cell image analysis. EtpE-C-coated beads entered bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from wild-type mice, whereas they neither bound nor entered BMDMs from DNase X<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Antibody against DNase X or DNase X knock-down by small interfering RNA impaired <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> binding, entry, and infection. <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> entry and infection rates of BMDMs from DNase X<sup>-/-</sup> mice and bacterial load in the peripheral blood in experimentally infected DNase X<sup>-/-</sup> mice, were significantly lower than those from wild-type mice. Thus this obligatory intracellular pathogen evolved a unique protein EtpE that binds DNase X to enter and infect eukaryotic cells. This study is the first to demonstrate the invasin and its mammalian receptor, and their <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance in any ehrlichial species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), discovered in 1986, was designated as a nationally notifiable disease by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1998. HME is one of the most prevalent, life-threatening emerging infectious diseases in the United States.

In order to test whether <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> infection can be prevented by EtpE immunization, mice were immunized with the recombinant EtpE protein, and challenged with live <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic>.

<italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic> causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), an emerging tick-borne zoonosis. From the site of infected tick bite on human skin, <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> infects monocytes and spreads via the bloodstream to various tissues, causing a systemic febrile disease. HME is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and elevated liver-enzyme levels, but complications such as pulmonary insufficiency, renal failure, encephalopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation can cause death <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Paddock1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Early diagnosis and the proper treatment with doxycycline are critical to prevent complications. The disease is of particular threat to the immunocompromised and the elderly people <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Paddock1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> is a small obligatory intracellular bacterium. It belongs to the family Anaplasmataceae in the order Rickettsiales that includes many understudied pathogens of veterinary and public health importance <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Rikihisa1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. By electron microscopy, <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> is a polymorphic bacterium (0.2&#x02013;2.0 &#x000b5;m in diameter), and can be morphologically categorized as small dense-cored cells (DCs) or large reticulate cells (RCs) <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Popov1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. DCs are &#x0223c;0.2&#x02013;0.5 &#x000b5;m in diameter, which is close to the size of the elementary body of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and larger viruses such as <italic>Vaccinia</italic> virus. By light microscopy, it is not possible to distinguish individual RCs and DCs, since <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> aggregates inside eukaryotic host cells. The characteristic clump of intracellular <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> organisms is termed as &#x0201c;morula&#x0201d; (mulberry in Latin) <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Rikihisa1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, when they are freshly isolated from host cells and dispersed, smaller bacteria (&#x0003c;0.5 &#x000b5;m) are more densely stained with basic dye than larger bacteria (&#x0003e;0.5 &#x000b5;m); therefore, they were defined as DCs and RCs, respectively <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. DCs are more resistant to strong sonication and more infectious than RCs <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In cell culture, a biphasic developmental cycle has been reported: initially small infectious DCs bind to and internalize into host cells, which then develop into larger replicating RCs inside a membrane-lined compartment that resembles early endosomes. After replication in expanding inclusions, the mature RCs transform back into DCs prior to release from the host cells <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In patients' blood specimens, monocytes were primarily infected with <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic>, and hence, the disease was named as &#x0201c;monocytic ehrlichiosis&#x0201d; to distinguish it from &#x0201c;granulocytic ehrlichiosis&#x0201d; caused by infection with granulocyte-tropic <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> sp. <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Paddock1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> can replicate well in several mammalian cell lines including canine histiocytic leukemia (DH82), human acute leukemia (THP-1), human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), human embryonic kidney (HEK293), and monkey endothelial (RF/6A) cells <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Mott1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003666-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Entry into the permissive eukaryotic host cells is essential for <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> to sustain its life, since its small genome of 1.18 Mb lacks a large portion of metabolic genes that are required for free living <xref rid="ppat.1003666-DunningHotopp1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> also lacks LPS, peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, and flagella that engage Toll-like or NOD-like receptors, or scavenger receptors <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Rikihisa1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Krieger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> entry and subsequent infection of THP-1 cells, but not binding are almost completely inhibited by monodansylcadaverine (MDC), a transglutaminase inhibitor <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

Furthermore, lipid raft-associated protein caveolin-1, but not clathrin localizes to the <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> entry site <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Lin2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

In order to study whether EtpE-C can mediate the invasion into permissive host cells in the absence of other <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> factors, we used latex beads coated with EtpE-C. The coated beads entered both phagocytes and non-phagocytes in a manner similar to <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> entry. Subsequent investigation led to the discovery that DNase X, a host cell surface GPI-anchored protein, is the receptor of EtpE-C mediating the entry of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> into several mammalian cell types permissive to its replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ECH1038 (EtpE) is highly expressed by <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> in mammalian cells</title><p>ECH1038 (GenBank accession no.

Phagocytes are very efficient in bacteria and particle uptake as they have an array of dedicated phagocytic receptors, including pathogen pattern recognition receptors, mannose receptors, scavenger receptors, receptors for immunoglobulin (FcR) and complement (CR3) that utilize opsonins for ingestion, to name a few <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Krieger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Aderem1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The other two cell lines used in this study, RF/6A endothelial and HEK293 epithelial cells, are referred to as non-phagocytes, since they lack these features. We first used non-phagocytes to study the effect of <italic>in vitro</italic> antibody neutralization of EtpE as they lack the response to opsonization and will not readily take-up opsonized particles. <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> was pre-incubated with mouse anti-EtpE-C or preimmune mouse sera, and then incubated with RF/6A cells. Binding and entry were determined by immunofluorescence labeling of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> with anti-P28 at 30 min and 2 h post-incubation/infection (pi), respectively. Infection was determined at 48 h pi by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Anti-EtpE-C blocked <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> binding, entry, and subsequently infection by approximately 80% compared to preimmune serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003666-g001">Fig. 1, D&#x02013;F</xref>).

<italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> entry of permissive host cells is an absolute requisite, not only in the pathogenesis of HME, but also for the very existence of the bacterium in nature owing to its inability to survive outside of eukaryotic cells. The present study showed that <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> surface protein EtpE is not only an adhesin that binds a specific receptor DNase X, a GPI-anchored mammalian cell surface protein, but also an invasin that subsequently mediates bacterial internalization. <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> entry into phagocytes and non-phagocytes was similar, but completely different from the phagocytosis of non-coated latex beads. Differences include 1) ability of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> to bind and enter non-phagocytes vs. inability of non-coated beads to enter non-phagocytes, 2) inhibition of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> entry into phagocytes and non-phagocytes by MDC, genistein, verapamil, and PI-PLC vs. lack of inhibition of entry of non-coated beads into phagocytes by these compounds, 3) DNase X-dependent entry of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> into phagocytes and non-phagocytes, vs. DNase X-independent entry of non-coated beads into phagocytes, and 4) colocalization of DNase X and <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> during entry vs. lack of colocalization of non-coated beads with DNase X. Remarkably, coating with a fragment of a single protein, EtpE-C made the beads to bind and enter non-phagocytes and phagocytes like <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> does. Similarities between EtpE-C-coated beads and <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> include 1) signaling pathways for invasion sensitive to MDC, genistein, verapamil, and PI-PLC, 2) DNase X-dependent adhesion and invasion, 3) colocalization with DNase X at entry foci during invasion, and 4) ultrastructure of entry process (filopodia, <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>).

The method is especially useful for those proteins poorly expressed on <italic>E. coli</italic> surface and/or when using host cells, such as macrophages, that are easily perturbed by <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Function of EtpE-C as an <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> invasin mediating its DNase X-dependent entry of host cells is strongly supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-EtpE-C neutralization results, and <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> requirement of DNase X for efficient <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> infection. The results suggest <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> invasion process, like inert rEtpE-C-coated latex beads, does not require bacterial energy. Adhesion alone seems to be sufficient in triggering cellular receptor-mediated signaling pathways resulting in filopodial extension and internalization. This is distinct from the triggering of bacterial uptake by the action of actively injected bacterial type III secretion system effector molecules <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Alonso1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Swanson1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, but in agreement with the condensed and resistant features of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> DCs capable of invasion <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Cheng2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This also is in agreement with the regulation of EtpE expression by a DNA binding protein BolA, which is in turn regulated by CtrA, a response regulator of the two-component system <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Cheng2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> CtrA positively regulates genes involved in the development of the resistant phenotype, at the late stage of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> growth cycle, when RCs convert to DCs <xref rid="ppat.1003666-Cheng2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The rosary-like pattern of EtpE in host cell surface-bound <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> did not preexist in host cell-free <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic>; thus might be induced by its engagement with cell surface DNase X upon binding. Significance of this change in EtpE surface distribution awaits further investigation.</p><p>Although both EtpE-N and EtpE-C were conserved among <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> strains, only EtpE-C mediated binding and entry into non-phagocytes, indicating functional specificity of this segment. In addition to the poor accessibility of anti-EtpE-N to its target on live <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> surface, the inability of EtpE-N to function as an invasin seems to be the primary reason for the weak <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> infection with anti-EtpE-N. While both EtpE-N and EtpE-C fragments were recognized and elicited humoral immune response in naturally infected humans and experimentally infected dogs, it seems that the antibody titer to EtpE-C is lower than to EtpE-N. This lower titer may help <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> to establish infection. Although the present study did not probe the function of the central region of EtpE, being variable among <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> strains, this segment of the protein may be under selective pressure in the host for <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> to persist in nature. Although EtpE is found in all <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> spp., amino acid sequences corresponding to EtpE-C are not conserved among EtpE orthologs of <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> spp.; whether these orthologs also serve as adhesins/invasins in other <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> sp. remain to be studied.</p><p>The present study showed that not only antibody against rEtpE-C neutralizes <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> infection <italic>in vitro</italic>, but also immunization of mice with rEtpE-C confers protection against <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> challenge.

Nonetheless, our results from <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization studies suggest a direct inhibition of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> binding by anti-EtpE-C antibody and support the importance of antibodies in ehrlichial immunity.
