worldwide. Recent studies have underlined the importance of the intercellular junction between <italic>Eh</italic> and host cells as a determinant in the pathogenesis of amebiasis. Despite the fact that direct contact and ligation between <italic>Eh</italic> surface Gal-lectin and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 with macrophage &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin are absolute requirements for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x003b2; release, many other undefined molecular events and downstream signaling occur at the interface of <italic>Eh</italic> and macrophage. In this study, we investigated the molecular events at the intercellular junction that lead to recognition of <italic>Eh</italic> through modulation of the macrophage cytoskeleton. Upon <italic>Eh</italic> contact with macrophages key cytoskeletal-associated proteins were rapidly post-translationally modified only with live <italic>Eh</italic> but not with soluble <italic>Eh</italic> proteins or fragments. <italic>Eh</italic> ligation with macrophages rapidly activated caspase-6 dependent cleavage of the cytoskeletal proteins talin, Pyk2 and paxillin and caused robust release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1&#x003b2;. Macrophage cytoskeletal cleavages were dependent on <italic>Eh</italic> cysteine proteinases <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A4 but not <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 based on pharmacological blockade of <italic>Eh</italic> enzyme inhibitors and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 deficient parasites. These results unravel a model where the intercellular junction between macrophages and <italic>Eh</italic> form an area of highly interacting proteins that implicate the macrophage cytoskeleton as a sensor for <italic>Eh</italic> contact that leads downstream to subsequent inflammatory immune responses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The protozoan parasite <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> can establish an enteric infection in human hosts that leads to symptoms ranging from diarrhea to abscesses in the liver and the brain. Host susceptibility to amebic infection is in part determined by the quality and potency of the host immune response that occurs once the parasite overcomes the mucus bilayers and colonic epithelial barriers, and invades underlying tissues. At the cellular level, one of the key events that shape the inflammatory response occurs during direct parasite interaction with host macrophages via surface proteins. The ensuing cascades of intracellular signaling events have only partly been uncovered. Interestingly, only direct interaction between live parasites and macrophages, as opposed to soluble factors or dead parasites, is a prerequisite to the generation of a prompt raging pro-inflammatory response. We have sought to further elucidate the mechanisms by which macrophages distinguish live parasites and found that the macrophage cell skeleton undergoes rapid significant alteration upon <italic>Eh</italic> contact. Furthermore, we uncovered a previously unknown role for two <italic>Eh</italic> enzymes in triggering macrophage pro-inflammatory responses. Through this work, we gain a better understanding of the molecular interactions that occur at the macrophage-ameba interface that regulate host inflammatory responses.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2014-04023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2636-557X</contrib-id><name><surname>Chadee</surname><given-names>Kris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by a Discovery Grant (RGPIN-2014-04023) from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada awarded to KC.

It is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, particularly in children of developing countries. <italic>Eh</italic> carriers remain asymptomatic in most cases, but in approximately 10% of infected individuals, <italic>Eh</italic> invades the intestinal tissues and triggers symptoms such as diarrhea, dysentery and colitis [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. <italic>Eh</italic> can also migrate to other soft tissue organs, notably the liver where it causes abscesses, and can lead to death. The reasons that lead to the development of symptomatic infection are not fully defined but host genetic makeup, quality of the immune response and <italic>Eh</italic> expression of virulence factors are thought to be contributing factors. For example, polymorphisms in the leptin gene, as well as expression of certain HLA class II alleles, have been associated with increased vulnerability to amebiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. At the parasite level, expression of many virulence factors by <italic>Eh</italic> have been shown to modulate the host inflammatory response as well as the ability to invade soft tissue organs outside the gut [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>Eh</italic> binding to the mucus layers and host cells is mediated by its major surface component, the Gal/GalNAc lectin (Gal-lectin) [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This 170kDa cell surface molecule has been shown to trigger innate immune responses and is a major target of the adaptive immune response [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Through homology search of the <italic>Eh</italic> genome, at least 50 genes encoding for cysteine peptidases (CP) have been identified [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Of these, <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1, <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A2 and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 are the most highly expressed in axenically cultured <italic>Eh</italic> isolate HM-1:IMSS and account for the majority of cysteine proteinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 is expressed on the cell surface, <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A2 localizes to the internal and external cell membrane and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 localizes to intracellular vesicles [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These CPs have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of amebiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, as these CPs are required for <italic>Eh</italic> life cycle and are key virulence factors, they represent attractive pharmaceutical targets [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The immune response is also a major determinant of the capacity of <italic>Eh</italic> to cause disease [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Upon invasion of underlying gut tissue, <italic>Eh</italic> are met by gut resident macrophages. These cells have been shown to secrete high amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; and possess amebicidal activity through the release of nitric oxide [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1; secretion has been associated with increased diarrheal disease, whereas nitric oxide and IFN-&#x003b3; are protective [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We have shown that macrophages only secrete IL-1&#x003b2; upon direct contact with <italic>Eh</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that was dependent on initial adhesion by <italic>Eh</italic> Gal-lectin and engagement of macrophage &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin by <italic>Eh</italic> cysteine protease 5 (<italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5) RGD sequences that activated the NLRP3 inflammasome. Thus, there is growing evidence that signaling events initiated at the intercellular junction between <italic>Eh</italic> and macrophages shape the ensuing immune response that are central in determining host susceptibility. We hypothesize that the macrophage cytoskeleton acts as a sensor that can distinguish the threat posed by invasion of live pathogens within the underlying gut tissue as opposed to soluble factors that bind to host immune cell receptors.</p><p>In this study, we sought to uncover the molecular mechanisms that allow macrophage recognition of invasive <italic>Eh</italic>. We found that live <italic>Eh</italic> in contact with macrophages induces caspase-6-dependent cleavage of cytoskeletal proteins triggered by <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A4 and culminates in IL-1&#x003b2; secretion by macrophages. These studies demonstrate a novel macrophage cellular pathway, as well as a novel function for parasite CPs in triggering IL-1&#x003b2; secretion upon contact with <italic>Eh</italic>. Moreover, this study further strengthens the hypothesis that direct contact between macrophages and <italic>Eh</italic> is a key event that initiates multiple cellular mechanisms at the intercellular junction that culminates in a potent pro-inflammatory response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Macrophage cytoskeleton undergoes rearrangement upon contact with <italic>Eh</italic></title><p>Recent studies [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] have established that direct contact between host cells and <italic>Eh</italic> mediated through the Gal-lectin and engagement of host cell integrins by <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 at the intercellular junction is a critical initiation step in eliciting a robust pro-inflammatory response. These events require an intact actin cytoskeleton for recruitment of the NLRP3 inflammasome to contact sites as well as caspase-1 activation and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. <italic>Eh</italic> have been shown to distinguish between live and dead cells and adapt their capacity to interact with the host membrane, as underlined by the fact that the former triggers trogocytosis preferentially whereas the latter induces phagocytosis of host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These findings suggest that dynamic remodeling of the host cell cytoskeleton is probable upon direct contact with <italic>Eh</italic> and may have functional implications in terms of host cell, as well as parasite responses. To establish whether <italic>Eh</italic> induces cytoskeletal remodeling in macrophages upon direct contact, macrophages were incubated with <italic>Eh</italic> for 10 min, and the cytoskeletal proteins actin and tubulin were visualized by confocal microscopy. As predicted, both tubulin and actin were heavily concentrated at the macrophage-<italic>Eh</italic> contact site (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006592.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>). Furthermore, microtubules were rapidly polarized towards the <italic>Eh</italic> contact site at the macrophage microtubule-organizing center. These results show that the cytoskeleton dynamically responded to <italic>Eh</italic> attachment at the macrophage intercellular junction.</p><fig id="ppat.1006592.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1006592.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Cytoskeletal modulation in macrophages upon contact with <italic>Eh</italic>.</title><p>Confocal microscopy of THP-1 macrophages incubated with <italic>Eh</italic> for 10 min. <italic>Eh</italic> were stained with Cell Tracker Blue prior to incubation.

Accordingly, we next investigated whether cleavage of these cytoskeletal proteins were mediated by proteolytic cleavage by calpains or caspases. To do this, macrophages were pre-treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and in response to <italic>Eh</italic>, inhibited the cleavage of talin, Pyk2 and paxillin in a dose-dependent manner (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006592.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). Through the use of a caspase inhibitor panel, we next identified the specific caspase responsible for cleavage of these proteins as caspase-6 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006592.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). None of the other inhibitors specific for caspases-1, -2, -3, -5, -8, and -9 inhibited <italic>Eh-</italic>induced cleavage of cytoskeletal-associated proteins. Consistent with these findings we found that caspase-6 was rapidly activated in <italic>Eh</italic> contacted macrophages, as shown by the appearance of the cleaved form of caspase-6 and degradation of one of its substrates, lamin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006592.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). Predictably, cleavage of macrophage cytoskeletal proteins was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the caspase-6-specific inhibitor Z-VEID (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006592.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>).

To confirm specificity for caspase-6 involvement in paxillin degradation, we silenced caspase-6 by siRNA in THP-1 cells and used scramble siRNA as a control, followed by incubation with <italic>Eh</italic> for 2 min. As predicted, silencing caspase-6 inhibited the degradation of paxillin cleavage products (proteins &#x0003e;55 kDa) with increasing concentration of caspase-6 siRNA (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006592.g003">Fig 3F</xref></bold>). Cleavage of lamin was used as a positive control that was also inhibited from degradation with increasing concentration of caspase-6 siRNA as compared to the negative and scrambled siRNA controls.

To determine this, we first measured IL-1&#x003b2; pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in macrophages pre-treated with the caspase-6 inhibitor, or DMSO control, for 60 min followed by incubation with <italic>Eh</italic> for 60 min.

We observed cytoskeletal rearrangement consistent with <italic>Eh</italic> engagement of cell-surface receptors, where microtubules reorient towards the target <italic>Eh</italic>, as well as actin accumulation at the contact point. This is reminiscent of many immune cell interactions such as the immune synapse and the phagocytic cup where receptor engagement, including integrins, induces microtubule polarization towards the target as well as actin accumulation at the site of contact [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This polarization could be a means to deliver key signaling complexes at the contact site, including the NLRP3 inflammasome which has been shown to co-localize with actin at the contact site [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin as well as phosphorylated paxillin was also shown to localize at the contact site indicating downstream signaling occurred upon interaction [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We thus sought to further investigate post-translational regulation of key cytoskeletal-associated proteins upon macrophage contact with <italic>Eh</italic>. While we hypothesized that these proteins would be subjected to phosphorylation, what we observed was that these proteins were rapidly subjected to cleavage. Cleavage of talin, Pyk2 and paxillin by calpains or caspase-3 has been reported in the context of adhesion disassembly and apoptosis [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We cannot, however, preclude the fact that phosphorylation may precede cleavage and actually make these proteins susceptible to cleavage by inducing conformational change [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This is supported by previous studies showing that serine phosphorylation of paxillin promotes its cleavage during cell migration [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Interference with the host cell cytoskeleton may be a mechanism by which <italic>Eh</italic> ingest host cells, either by trogocytosis or by phagocytosis. Trogocytosis is observed rapidly upon contact with live host cells that exhibit cell membrane deformability [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Modification of the host cell cytoskeleton upon contact may represent the early molecular mechanisms allowing for cell deformability and subsequent ingestion of membrane portions by <italic>Eh</italic>. The process of trogocytosis, however, has not yet been reported in macrophages.</p><p>Our data unveil a new role for caspase-6 in the alteration of cytoskeletal-associated proteins, as well as in the macrophage inflammatory response to <italic>Eh</italic>. We show that cleavage of talin, Pyk2 and paxillin upon contact with <italic>Eh</italic> was mediated by caspase-6 activation as inhibition of caspase-6 by Z-VEID prevented their cleavage. In the latter, caspase-6 was shown to concentrate proximally to points of contact with <italic>Eh</italic>. Although caspase-6 is classified as an effector caspase along with caspase-3 and caspase-7, there is increasing evidence that its role extends beyond apoptosis [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A role for caspase-6 in B-cell activation and differentiation, and more recently in macrophage activation, has been shown [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, caspase-6 is ubiquitously expressed and the highest levels of pro-caspase-6 are observed in fetal and adult colon [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Therefore, further studies in the role of caspase-6 in gut inflammatory responses are warranted to assess whether this mechanism is unique to amebiasis or whether caspase-6 plays a broader role in triggering cytokine secretion and cytoskeletal remodeling.</p><p>The caspase-6-mediated cleavage of cytoskeletal-associated proteins was only observed when macrophages were incubated with live <italic>Eh</italic>. Similar results were observed with NLRP3 inflammasome activation upon ligation of <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 and Gal-lectin. Soluble <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 or Gal-lectin alone was not sufficient to induce NLRP3 and caspase-1 activation and subsequent IL-1&#x003b2; release [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This likely reflects the importance that <italic>Eh</italic> factors to be delivered to the intercellular junction in a directed manner allowing for saturation of macrophage receptors to trigger downstream signaling cascades. We propose that this mechanism allows macrophages to distinguish between interactions of live invading <italic>Eh</italic> in comparison to sampling of soluble components of the gut lumen. The escalating pro-inflammatory response ensuing detection of live pathogens thus reflects the tailoring of the reaction against tissue-invading pathogens. The requirement for direct cell contact may also reflect the necessity of <italic>Eh</italic> to attach to host cells to release intracellular contents at the intercellular junction. In fact, <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A4, which we show are necessary for triggering cleavage of cytoskeletal-associated proteins, localize to intracellular vesicles in <italic>Eh</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 localizes to large cytoplasmic vesicles whereas <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A4 is contained in acidic vesicles in <italic>Eh</italic>, yet has been shown to be released in culture medium as well as in the microenvironment <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A4 undergoes autocatalytic activation at acidic pH, provided by acidic vesicles, yet its optimal proteolytic activity is observed at physiological pH [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. By staining the surface of non-permeabilized cells, we showed that both <italic>Eh</italic> cysteine proteinases are found at the cell surface, and polarized to the macrophage contact site. This supports a model by which these cysteine proteinases are delivered at the junction site in a defined manner, and have a role in triggering the macrophage inflammatory response. Future studies on the dynamics of <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1- and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A4-containing vesicles upon contact with host cells are necessary to uncover the mechanism of release in the microenvironment.</p><p>Our data unveil new roles for both <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A4 in eliciting pro-inflammatory responses by macrophages. Interestingly, <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A4 expression is significantly higher in HM-1:IMSS than in the less virulent Rahman strain, whereas <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 transcription levels are similar between those two strains [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 release in medium is significant only for HM-1:IMSS compared to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>dispar</italic> and the less virulent L6 <italic>Eh</italic> clone [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 expression has been shown to increase almost twofold following invasion in a mouse model of amebic colitis, whereas <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 expression was unchanged [<xref rid="ppat.1006592.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 would have a central role in regulating key cytoskeletal-associated proteins as it binds to macrophage integrin, it was not necessary for triggering cleavage of talin, Pyk2 or paxillin. Rather, the finding of another mechanism that relies on direct contact between macrophage and <italic>Eh</italic>, and that culminates in IL-1&#x003b2; release further reinforces that the intercellular junction is a hot spot for molecular events that shape the subsequent pro-inflammatory response during amebiasis. We propose an integrated model (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006592.g009">Fig 9</xref></bold>) by which contact between live <italic>Eh</italic> and macrophages is first established by binding via the Gal-lectin at the <italic>Eh</italic> cell surface as well as <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5 binding to macrophage &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin. We hypothesize that contact mediates the release of <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A4 from <italic>Eh</italic> in a polarized fashion at the intercellular junction. The <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5/integrin axis mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation whereas <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A4 mediate caspase-6 activation and subsequent cytoskeletal-associated protein cleavage. Together, these pathways culminate in potent IL-1&#x003b2; release from macrophages. The molecular mechanisms linking some of these events remain to be addressed. For example, the requirements for <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A1 and <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A4 release and interaction with macrophages as well as the signaling events that culminate in caspase-6 activation remain unknown. The consequence of post-translational modification of cytoskeletal-associated proteins in remodeling of the macrophage cytoskeleton upon contact with <italic>Eh</italic> also needs to be examined. Nonetheless, this study underlines the fact that the intercellular junction is a hotspot for initiation of the inflammatory response to <italic>Eh</italic> and further investigation will unravel mechanistic pathways that will provide a better understanding of macrophage and amebic biology.</p><fig id="ppat.1006592.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1006592.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the <italic>Eh</italic>-macrophage interacting proteins at the intercellular junction.</title><p>Contact between <italic>Eh</italic> and macrophages are initiated by high affinity binding with the Gal-lectin. <italic>Eh</italic>CP-A5, which is expressed at the surface of <italic>Eh</italic>, has been shown to bind to the &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin at the surface of macrophages through the RGD motif.

Media was replaced with complete RPMI 24 h later. <italic>Eh</italic> stimulation was performed 48 h following siRNA transfection for 2 min for analysis by Western blot, or 60 min for assessment of IL-1&#x003b2; secretion.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Western blots</title><p>Equal amounts of lysate were loaded on SDS-PAGE gel followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and blocking in 5% skim milk. Western blots were done using the indicated primary antibody and appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and visualized with either SuperSignal Chemiluminescence Reagents (Pierce Biotechnology) or ChemiLucent ECL detection (EMD Millipore). When sequential Western blots were performed, PVDF membranes were incubated with stripping buffer (25mM Glycine, 1% SDS, pH 2.0) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by extensive washing and blocking with 5% skim milk.

Slides were then washed and incubated for 60 min with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Donkey anti-Rabbit 1:250 and donkey anti-Chicken IgY 1:250) and DAPI at room temperature. Quantification of the abundance of activated caspase-6 at the THP-1/<italic>Eh</italic> interface was done in ImageJ as previously published<sup>30</sup>. Quantification of <italic>Eh</italic>CP polarization was performed in ImageJ by measuring the integrated density of the front half of <italic>Eh</italic> and rear facing half, expressing this as a ratio adjusted for total area size.
