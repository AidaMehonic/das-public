Here we describe an inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B from vaccinia virus that has a closely related counterpart in variola virus, the cause of smallpox, and mechanistic similarity with the HIV protein Vpu. Protein A49 blocks NF-&#x003ba;B activation by molecular mimicry and contains a motif conserved in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; which, in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, is phosphorylated by IKK&#x003b2; causing ubiquitination and degradation. Like I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, A49 binds the E3 ligase &#x003b2;-TrCP, thereby preventing ubiquitination and degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. Consequently, A49 stabilised phosphorylated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; (p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;) and its interaction with p65, so preventing p65 nuclear translocation. Serine-to-alanine mutagenesis within the I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;-like motif of A49 abolished &#x003b2;-TrCP binding, stabilisation of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation.

Consequently, viruses have evolved mechanisms to reduce activation of host response to infection and this paper provides an example of this. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) is an important transcription factor that activates the host response to infection and is normally retained in an inactive form in the cytoplasm bound to an inhibitor called I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. However, upon stimulation by infection, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; is degraded and NF-&#x003ba;B moves to the nucleus to activate expression of genes mediating the host response. Here we describe how protein A49 from vaccinia virus, the vaccine used to eradicate smallpox, mimics I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; to hijack the cellular degradation machinery and so stabilise I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and retain NF-&#x003ba;B in the cytoplasm. The importance of A49 is demonstrated by the fact that a virus lacking A49 was less virulent than control viruses, despite the expression of several other NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitors by vaccinia virus. Interestingly, HIV protein Vpu functions in a similar way to A49 and, given that A49 is highly conserved in variola virus, this work reveals a common strategy for suppression of host innate immunity by the viruses that cause smallpox and AIDS.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust (#090315), the UK Medical Research Council (G0900224) and Science Foundation Ireland (07/IN1/B934).

In the past two decades, the discovery of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLR), intracellular nucleic acid sensors and inflammasomes has established the link between sensing pathogens and responding to them <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Medzhitov1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Following sensing of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), signalling cascades lead to the activation of transcription factors that induce the expression of interferons (IFN), cytokines, chemokines and other pro-inflammatory molecules. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in switching on the immune system and proteins induced by NF-&#x003ba;B are responsible for the amplification of the innate response and for the recruitment of cells of the immune system, so linking innate and adaptive immunity <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Iwasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Lawrence1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The signalling cascade leading to transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes by NF-&#x003ba;B is well studied <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It can be initiated by TLR ligands, interleukin (IL)-1 or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)&#x003b1; and leads to the phosphorylation of the inhibitor of &#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B) by the I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) complex, the ubiquitination and degradation of phosphorylated I&#x003ba;B (p-I&#x003ba;B), and the translocation of the NF-&#x003ba;B heterodimer p65/p50 into the nucleus <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Oeckinghaus1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These steps are central in the NF-&#x003ba;B canonical signalling pathway and represent targets for pathogen evasion <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Brodsky1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In particular, the ubiquitination and degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; requires the recognition of its phosphorylated form <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Alkalay1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> by the E3 ligase &#x003b2;-transducing repeat containing protein (&#x003b2;-TrCP) <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Yaron1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. &#x003b2;-TrCP belongs to the Skp1, Cullin1, F-box protein (SCF) family and induces I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; ubiquitination <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Deshaies1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Kanarek1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. &#x003b2;-TrCP was identified originally as the ubiquitin ligase targeted by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 viral protein U (Vpu) to cause CD4 degradation <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Margottin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and exists in 2 forms with very similar properties and specificity <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Moss1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

So although there are other NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitors expressed by v&#x00394;A49, the A49 protein seems dominant in stabilising the I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;/NF-&#x003ba;B complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The IRFs and NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors are central to a coordinated immune response and their activation culminates in the expression of IFN&#x003b2;, which induces an antiviral state in cells, and the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which recruit lymphoid cells to the site of infection. In response to this host defence, viruses have evolved many mechanisms to suppress the host immune response and complete their life cycle. Understanding how viruses evade immune responses can aid understanding of virus pathogenesis and of the immune system itself.</p><p>Here, the VACV WR A49 protein is shown to be an inhibitor of innate immune signalling by blocking NF-&#x003ba;B activation. A49 was identified as an inhibitor of IFN&#x003b2; expression in a screen of VACV proteins encoded near the genome termini, and dissection of the mechanism by which A49 inhibited IFN&#x003b2; activation showed that A49 blocked NF-&#x003ba;B activation by binding to the WD40 domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase &#x003b2;-TrCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003183-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003183-g005">5</xref>). Thus, even though I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; was phosphorylated by upstream kinases, &#x003b2;-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; was reduced, p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; was stabilised in complex with NF-&#x003ba;B and so NF-&#x003ba;B was retained in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003183-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-1003183-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003183.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation by A49.</title><p>Model depicting how poxvirus protein A49 interferes with activation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B by targeting the E3 ligase &#x003b2;-TrCP and thus preventing the degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1003183.g008"/></fig><p>A49 mediates its anti-NF-&#x003ba;B activity via molecular mimicry. Near the N terminus of A49 there is a SGLNES sequence that is closely related to motifs in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2;, HIV Vpu and other &#x003b2;-TrCP substrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003183.s001">Figure S1</xref>, 4A) suggesting that A49, like these other proteins, might bind &#x003b2;-TrCP. This interaction was shown by reciprocal immunoprecipitation of transfected tagged molecules and of endogenous &#x003b2;-TrCP and A49 made during VACV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003183-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Mutagenesis of the conserved serines within SGLNES to alanines prevented interaction with &#x003b2;-TrCP, stabilisation of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, and inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003183-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003183.s004">S4</xref>). Conversely, mutation of these residues to glutamic acid increased the binding of A49 to &#x003b2;-TrCP and enhanced the inhibitory activity of A49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003183-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This observation is in contrast to mutagenesis of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; where substitution of phospho-serines with glutamic or aspartic acid reduced I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; recognition <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Yaron1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This indicates that in the A49 motif, charge-based interactions are sufficient to support binding. Notably, between the conserved serines A49 is one residue longer than in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, like some &#x003b2;-TrCP substrates e.g. p105 <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. This residue is after the glycine and before the hydrophobic amino acid known to insert in the &#x003b2;-TrCP hydrophobic groove <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>The A49 protein is conserved in the majority of VACV strains and orthopoxviruses (OPVs) including variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003183.s001">Figure S1</xref>). But in ectromelia, camelpox and monkeypox viruses the A49 coding region is disrupted by mutation, showing A49 was non-essential for replication of those OPVs. The isolation of v&#x00394;A49 which replicated normally in cell culture and produced a normal sized plaque confirmed A49 is dispensable for VACV also (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003183.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However, v&#x00394;A49 was less virulent compared to controls <italic>in vivo</italic> and this attenuation was characterised by lower weight loss, more rapid recovery and lower virus titres in infected lungs on days 5 and 7 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003183-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This attenuation, and the substantial increase of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; stability mediated by A49 during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003183-g007">Figure 7</xref>), was despite the fact that VACV expresses several other inhibitors of NF-&#x003ba;B activation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">introduction</xref>). The activity of A49 is clearly, therefore, not redundant. This might be explained by either these different proteins acting at different stages in the activation pathway, or them having multiple functions. In the former case, if an NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor acted only downstream of the IL-1R or the TNFR before these pathways converge, it might give a different phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> to an inhibitor that acted downstream of where these pathways converge. In addition, since there is crosstalk between the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and other pathways, such as the MAP kinases for instance, an inhibitor might affect these other pathways too depending on its site of action. Concerning the possibility that the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitors might have multiple functions, this has already been demonstrated in some cases. For instance, the N1 protein not only inhibits NF-&#x003ba;B activation <xref rid="ppat.1003183-DiPerna1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003183-MaluquerdeMotes1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> but also inhibits apoptosis <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Cooray1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and these functions are assigned to different binding surfaces of the protein <xref rid="ppat.1003183-MaluquerdeMotes1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. With A49, there is a parallel with the HIV Vpu protein, which contains the conserved motif for interaction with &#x003b2;-TrCP, and has more than one function. Not only does Vpu interact with &#x003b2;-TrCP and so diminish degradation of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, and hence block NF-&#x003ba;B activation <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Bour1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, but Vpu also engages other proteins such as CD4 and tetherin and so brings these to &#x003b2;-TrCP for ubiquitination and degradation <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Blanchet1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. It is possible that A49 will also bind other cellular proteins and target these for &#x003b2;-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation in a manner advantageous for VACV. The identification of such targets may require their stabilisation by use of proteasomal inhibitors or mutants of A49, such as the S7/12A, which no longer bind to &#x003b2;-TrCP.</p><p>A comparison of the VACV-encoded inhibitors of NF-&#x003ba;B B14 and A49 is particularly interesting. The B14 protein binds IKK&#x003b2; and reduces phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, and thereby activation of NF-&#x003ba;B <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Benfield1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In contrast, A49 reduces ubiquitination of p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and thus stabilises it. So B14 is acting at the step in the NF-&#x003ba;B activation pathway immediately upstream of the A49 protein. The benefit of multiple viral inhibitors of NF-&#x003ba;B was demonstrated here by the detection of more p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; after infection with vA49rev than v&#x00394;A49 despite the presence of B14 in both viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003183-g007">Figure 7A, B</xref>). Therefore, these viral inhibitors work in combination to abrogate NF-&#x003ba;B activation during viral infection and each contributes to virus virulence. But, unexpectedly, the attenuation induced by loss of B14 or A49 is apparent in different <italic>in vivo</italic> models. In an intradermal model of infection <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Tscharke1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Tscharke2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> a virus lacking B14 showed attenuation, but this virus had normal virulence in the intranasal model <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Conversely, v&#x00394;A49 was attenuated in the intranasal model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003183-g001">Figure 1</xref>) but not in the intradermal model (data not shown). This intriguing difference might be explained by either A49 or B14, or both proteins, having additional functions.</p><p>Although many inhibitors of NF-&#x003ba;B had been reported in VACV previously, genetic evidence had suggested the existence of additional inhibitor(s) because the VACV strain v811 stabilised p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; despite lacking all known inhibitors of TNF&#x003b1;-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation <xref rid="ppat.1003183-FaganGarcia1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The <italic>A49R</italic> gene is present in mutant v811 <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Perkus1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> and so the A49 protein probably represents such an inhibitor. A49 represents one of several virus proteins that target &#x003b2;-TrCP. In addition to A49 and HIV Vpu, rotavirus <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Graff1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> and Epstein-Barr virus <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> also modulate &#x003b2;-TrCP activity. The widespread targeting of &#x003b2;-TrCP illustrates the importance of the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TrCP</sup> complex for pathogen-induced responses.</p><p>In conclusion, the VACV A49 protein inhibits &#x003b2;-TrCP function by molecular mimicry and thereby blocks NF-&#x003ba;B activation, promotes immune evasion and enhances virus virulence. Given that a highly conserved version of A49 is encoded by all (&#x0223c;50) strains of variola virus sequenced <xref rid="ppat.1003183-Esposito1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, it is probable that this strategy for increasing virulence by immune evasion is conserved in the pathogens that cause smallpox and AIDS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This work was carried out in accordance with regulations of The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
