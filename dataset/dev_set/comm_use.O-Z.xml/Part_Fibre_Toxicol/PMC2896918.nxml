Some epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with diabetes may be a particularly susceptible population. This study examined effects of short-term exposures to ambient PM<sub>2.5 </sub>on markers of systemic inflammation, coagulation, autonomic control of heart rate, and repolarization in 22 adults (mean age: 61 years) with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Each individual was studied for four consecutive days with daily assessments of plasma levels of blood markers. Cardiac rhythm and electrocardiographic parameters were examined at rest and with 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitors. PM<sub>2.5 </sub>and meteorological data were measured daily on the rooftop of the patient exam site. Data were analyzed with models adjusting for season, weekday, meteorology, and a random intercept. To identify susceptible subgroups, effect modification was analyzed by clinical characteristics associated with insulin resistance as well as with oxidative stress and by medication intake.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha showed a significant increase with a lag of two days (percent change of mean level: 20.2% with 95%-confidence interval [6.4; 34.1] and 13.1% [1.9; 24.4], respectively) in association with an increase of 10 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3 </sup>in PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Obese participants as well as individuals with elevated glycosylated hemoglobin, lower adiponectin, higher ferritin or with glutathione S-transferase M1 null genotype showed higher IL-6 effects. Changes in repolarization were found immediately as well as up to four days after exposure in individuals without treatment with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Exposure to elevated levels of PM<sub>2.5 </sub>alters ventricular repolarization and thus may increase myocardial vulnerability to arrhythmias. Exposure to PM<sub>2.5 </sub>also increases systemic inflammation. Characteristics associated with insulin resistance or with oxidative stress were shown to enhance the association.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>As a consequence of life-style patterns contributing to obesity the number of people with diabetes in the United States has reached 26.8 million in 2010 and by 2030 is expected to affect 12% of adults (age: 20-79 years) as compared to 10.3% today; worldwide 285 million people have type 2 diabetes and by 2030, that number is expected to rise to 439 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Metabolic abnormalities caused by diabetes induce vascular dysfunction that predisposes diabetic individuals to atherosclerosis and its complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The risk of developing coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease is increased up to four-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, diabetic individuals have greater disease progression and higher cardiovascular mortality rates compared to non-diabetic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Individuals having diabetes have been shown to be at greater risk for morbidity and mortality associated with exposure to ambient air pollution particulate matter (PM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although many people with diabetes have secondary cardiovascular complications, as a group they show larger responses to PM than people with cardiovascular (CV) disease and no diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the mechanisms accounting for the increased risk is unknown.</p><p>Epidemiological as well as toxicological research have shown PM-induced changes in autonomic nervous system function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] as well as in vascular factors involved in inflammation and coagulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], particularly in elderly people with CV disease. Since diabetic individuals appear to have additional risk factors for PM-associated mortality and morbidity beyond those found in people with CV, we hypothesize that changes in these health endpoints might be even more pronounced in people with diabetes than in people with CV disease without diabetes, who have been characterized in other studies.</p><p>In this study we assessed the effects of ambient fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) on repeated measures of cardiac autonomic balance, systemic inflammation and coagulation in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Fluctuations in daily air pollution measurements from a local air monitoring station were associated with changes in health effect parameters which provide information about responses by the immune, vascular, cardiac, hematologic, and autonomic nervous systems. To determine if severity of diabetes was associated with increased responsiveness to PM, we analyzed effect modifications associated with insulin resistance (obesity, age, poor glycemic control, adiponectin). We also analyzed effect modifications associated with markers of oxidative stress or potential markers of susceptibility to oxidative stress (myeloperoxidase (MPO), ferritin and glutathione S-transferase M1 (<italic>GSTM1</italic>)), and medication usage (beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Twenty-two volunteers, aged 48-78, with type 2 diabetes were identified through the University of North Carolina (UNC) Diabetes Clinic and through newspaper advertisements. Details on the inclusion and exclusion criteria have been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Potential participants had to have a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, but without taking insulin; and be on a stable medication regimen throughout their participation. Volunteers were excluded if they had a recent vascular event or intervention such as coronary artery graft bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention. Participants were asked to refrain from vigorous exercise on study-mornings and to refrain from medications like anti-oxidants (vitamins C and E), fish oil, niacin, arginine, over-the-counter vasoactive agents such as decongestants, anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin unless it was prescribed as a daily medication (in which case it was continued) for the week prior to the study as well as the week of the study. Participants were also asked to refrain from use of phosphodiesterase enzyme inhibitors during the week of the study.</p><p>Each participant visited the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Health Effects Environmental Laboratory, Environmental Public Health Division (EPHD) in Chapel Hill, NC, on five consecutive weekdays between November 2004 and December 2005. Data on health status, pulmonary and cardiac symptoms, medication, and smoking history were obtained at baseline and during four follow-up visits. Altogether a maximum of 88 observations were available for analysis, depending on the examined health outcome. All volunteers signed a written consent form and the study protocol was approved by the UNC Human Studies Biomedical Institutional Review Board as well as by the EPA.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical measurements</title><sec><title>Clinical procedures</title><p>On Monday morning of each examination week the participants completed a baseline questionnaire.

Electrodes were changed each morning to ensure adequate skin contact and new batteries and a fresh flash card were used. A trained research nurse manually edited the sequence of ECG complexes to ensure proper labeling of each QRS complex. RR-intervals that were more or less than 20% of the previous RR-interval were defined as abnormally long or short intervals and were interpolated using Mortara algorithms. Subsequent heart rate variability (HRV) indices in both the time and frequency domains were calculated from these edited records (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). A detailed description of the measurements has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Data was collected during a 30-minute period each morning while the subjects rested quietly in a darkened room.</p><p>Time-domain parameters were calculated over a 24-hour period starting at the beginning of the resting period. The standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), root-mean-square of successive differences (RMSSD) and percentage of adjacent normal-to-normal intervals which differ more than 50 ms (pNN50) were assessed. A 5-minute segment during the end of the resting period was used to calculate frequency domain and repolarization indices. From the spectra the frequency bands 0.04-0.15 Hz (low frequency (LF)) and 0.15-0.40 Hz (high frequency (HF)) were calculated in absolute and heart rate-normalized units (LF_norm and HF_norm). Total power (TP), the low-to-high frequency power ratio (LF/HF) and resting heart rate (HR) were also determined.</p><p>Because spatiotemporal heterogeneity of repolarization contributes to the initiation of arrhythmia, we also calculated markers of cardiac repolarization including heart rate (Bazett)-corrected QT interval (QTc), normalized QT variance (QT norm), QT variability index (QTVI), T wave amplitude, and T wave complexity together with the variability (standard deviation) of T wave complexity. QTc is reported as the average of eight consecutive beats on a composite of all leads. The normalized QT variance was calculated by QT_norm = QT_variance/(mean QT)<sup>2</sup>. The QT variability index (QTVI) was derived for each interval according to the equation: QTVI = log<sub>10 </sub>[(QT<sub>v</sub>/QT<sub>m</sub><sup>2</sup>)/(HR<sub>v</sub>/HR<sub>m</sub><sup>2</sup>)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] with the heart rate mean (HR<sub>m</sub>) and variance (HR<sub>v</sub>) and QT interval mean (QT<sub>m</sub>) and variance (QT<sub>v</sub>) being computed from the respective time series for each 5-minute interval. For T wave amplitude, original ECG leads I, II, V1 to V6 were used and the median value from those eight original leads was taken for each cardiac cycle and averaged over five minutes. T wave complexity was measured in each beat by principal component analysis (PCA) based on all 12 leads and averaged over the 5-minute period.</p><p>Altogether, four blood samples, four blood pressure measurements, four 5-minute resting ECGs, and three 24-hour ECGs were intended to be collected from each subject.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Air pollution monitoring</title><p>Concentrations of fine ambient PM (average from 9 AM - 9 AM) were measured on each clinic day and for the four prior days with a 3000K Versatile Air Pollution Sampler (URG Corp., Chapel Hill, NC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] located on the EPHD rooftop approximately 30 meters above ground level. In addition, daily 24-hour concentrations (midnight to midnight) of fine ambient PM<sub>2.5 </sub>mass were obtained from a monitoring station located approximately 44 kilometers (27 miles) east of the EPHD and operated by the State of North Carolina. The Spearman correlation between both PM<sub>2.5 </sub>measurements was 0.85 across the 14 month study period and the network data was used to impute missing rooftop data based on a linear regression model. Of thirteen daily averages relevant for the health outcome analysis, eleven could be imputed and only two remained missing.</p><p>Continuous 2-minute measurements of air temperature, barometric pressure and relative humidity were obtained from the EPHD rooftop and 24-hour averages were calculated.

Thus every person acted as his/her own control which limited the need for an adjustment for patient characteristics in the analysis.</p><p>Data were analyzed using the statistical package SAS Version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). For the analysis of the PM effect, additive mixed models with a random participant effect and "compound symmetry" covariance structure were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Model building to identify meteorological and temporal determinants, as potential confounders, was done for each outcome variable separately. Model fit was assessed by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Details on the confounder selection process can be found in Schneider et al. (2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The exposure, in this case rooftop PM<sub>2.5 </sub>mass, was considered as an immediate (lag 0) or a delayed (lag 1 to lag 4) linear effect. Effect estimates are presented as percentage changes of the mean outcome variable together with 95%-confidence intervals (CI) for a 10 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3 </sup>increment in ambient PM<sub>2.5 </sub>mass.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses were done by changing the covariance structure to first order autocorrelation as well as by repeating parts of the analysis with PM<sub>2.5 </sub>values that were not imputed. In addition, analyses were repeated using network PM<sub>2.5 </sub>data imputed with rooftop PM<sub>2.5 </sub>data as exposure. Individuals that had experienced PM<sub>2.5 </sub>values exceeding 35 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3 </sup>during their relevant days of exposure were excluded to examine if health effects occurred also below current 24-hour U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Moreover, to assess the heterogeneity across study participants in this repeated measures study, we examined patient-specific, random slope-models for selected PM<sub>2.5 </sub>results.</p><p>Effect modification was examined using dichotomous indicator variables (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).

We also found PM-associated changes in autonomic nervous system control of heart rate as well as changes in ventricular repolarization. These changes did not occur simultaneously, but rather as a wave of response over a 4-5 day period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] there is an immediate change in endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation); here we also observed rapid changes in some electrocardiographic parameters (SDNN, QTc), as well as systolic blood pressure. Other measures of repolarization (T wave complexity, T wave amplitude) and vascular factors associated with clotting/fibrinolysis (Factor VII, PAI-1) as well as red blood cell-associated indices (RBCs, MCV, hemoglobin) changed with a lag of 1-3 days. Strong increases in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; as well as blood eosinophils were observed with a delay of two days. Changes in markers of clotting/fibrinolysis (Factor IX, Protein C, fibrinogen) as well as CRP also occurred with the same lag. Finally, additional markers of heart rate variability (pNN50, RMSSD) and blood lipids (TC, LDL, HDL) changed with a lag of 3-4 days. Effect modification analyses revealed that overall the effects were more pronounced in the subgroup with clinical characteristics associated with insulin resistance (high BMI, high HbA1c, and low adiponectin level). Characteristics associated with greater oxidative stress potential (high ferritin level and <italic>GSTM1 </italic>null) also influenced PM associations found for IL-6 and RBC. It is unclear whether the immediate effects in endothelial function and electrocardiographic parameters are causally related to the more delayed effects in blood parameters or whether they occur via independent mechanisms.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Timing of health effects in association with ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub></bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-8977-7-14-6"/></fig><sec><title>Inflammation and coagulation blood parameters</title><p>One of the more robust findings of this study is the association between PM and increases in TNF&#x003b1; and IL-6 levels in the blood. IL-6 acts as both a pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine and plays a role in the acute phase response. TNF&#x003b1; plays a key role in the initiation of systemic inflammation and regulation of immune cells. The fact that both of these markers of inflammation are elevated in association with PM concentrations, as well as blood eosinophils, CRP, and fibrinogen (the latter both not significantly) indicates that ambient levels of PM are capable of inducing an inflammatory response in the blood.</p><p>Dubowsky et al.(2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] also reported PM-associated increases in IL-6 and CRP in individuals with diabetes, with significance being achieved with a 3-4 day moving average of PM. Interestingly, in our study inflammatory markers were observed with a lag of two days. The effect size of the slight, but non-significant increases in CRP and fibrinogen with lag 2 in our study is in agreement with other air pollution epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our albumin results should be interpreted cautiously as albumin is often used as a measure of blood density and is an abundant blood protein that normally does not vary much. However, it can also be interpreted as an anti-acute phase protein and therefore the decreases at lag 1 and lag 2 fit well within the blood marker interplay of an inflammatory reaction. The strong delayed increase in eosinophils, an inflammatory leukocyte cell type, adds to this picture. However, the small increase in eosinophils in our non-asthmatic individuals is of uncertain significance regarding the inflammatory status and may also be related to an allergic or Th2 immune response governed by interleukin-5.</p></sec><sec><title>Erythrocytes</title><p>We observed a decrease in RBC with a lag of 1-3 days, as well as decreased levels of hemoglobin and MCV. These findings are consistent with those of Seaton et al. (1999) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and R&#x000fc;ckerl et al. (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], who saw significant decreases in both parameters in a similar time-frame. They and others have speculated that PM may cause constriction of small blood vessels or alter the adhesive properties of RBC, thus increasing the time these cells spend in systemic capillaries and not in larger vessels. Since increased oxidative stress is known to decrease the life span of RBC, it is also possible that PM-associated increases in oxidative stress which have been reported by many, could also result in fewer RBCs or could, perhaps, injure these sensitive cells causing leakage of hemoglobin and decreased volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood lipids</title><p>In this study we observed an early decrease in HDL followed by decreases in HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol with a lag of 3-4 days. This is in contrast to an earlier study in which we observed increased levels of triglycerides and LDL associated with exposure of asthmatics to coarse PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, it is in partial agreement with a study in which we reported decreased HDL/LDL ratio, VLDL, and triglycerides in healthy volunteers exposed to ultrafine particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. One explanation for a PM-associated decrease in blood lipids is that PM-induced oxidative stress might modify blood lipids, making them more prone to adhere to vascular walls and removing them from the circulation. Kunitomo et al. (2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] reported that exposure of mice to tobacco smoke resulted in oxidatively modified LDL. Araujo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] reported that exposure of mice to ultrafine and fine particles resulted in oxidized blood lipids as well as an inhibition of the anti-inflammatory capacity of HDL. Soares et al. (2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] also reported that in mice exposed to urban air pollution LDL was oxidized and the lipid content of arterial plaques was increased. Another possible explanation for the observed lipid decreases is that they are related to changes known to occur during acute inflammation and the acute phase response. According to a review by Khovidhunkit et al. (2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] infection and inflammation lead either to no change or to a decrease in serum cholesterol, LDL as well as HDL levels during the acute-phase response in humans.</p><p>Other studies have reported PM-associated changes in blood lipids. Suwa et al. (2002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] demonstrated in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits that exposure to PM<sub>10 </sub>increased the total amount of lipids in aortic lesions. Sun et al. (2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] showed in a murine model that the lipid content in the aortic arch increased 1.5-fold in mice fed a high-fat chow diet and exposed to PM versus filtered air. In an epidemiologic case-control study of traffic-exposed police officers, the average values of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were elevated in the exposed group versus an unexposed control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>ECG parameters and blood pressure</title><p>In our study, we found a slight immediate increase in SDNN and delayed positive associations between RMSSD, pNN50 and air pollution exposure, with the latter suggesting increased efferent vagal activity.

An occupational study of NC State Highway Patrol troopers reported positive associations between PM and heart beat cycle length, HRV and ectopic beats on the next morning after their shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Wheeler et al. (2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] reported a positive relationship between SDNN and PM<sub>2.5 </sub>in patients with pulmonary disease, whereas an inverse association was observed in patients with cardiovascular disease. Moreover, healthy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and asthmatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] volunteers exposed to concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) showed an increase in HF and LF approximately 18 hours after exposure.</p><p>In contrast to HRV, repolarization parameters have only recently been investigated in air pollution studies. In our study we observed an immediate negative association between PM<sub>2.5 </sub>exposure and QTc, indicative of vagal stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In addition, we observed changes in T wave amplitude. Decrements in T wave amplitude corresponded with increments in T wave complexity and vice versa. These findings are in agreement with other studies. In a study of male coronary artery disease patients, Henneberger et al. (2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] reported an increase of QTc associated with organic carbon as well as a decrease of T wave amplitude and an increase of T wave complexity associated with ultrafine particles (UFP) and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Frampton et al. (2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and Samet et al. (2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] reported reduced QT intervals in healthy individuals breathing air and UFP with intermittent exercise. Zareba et al. (2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] demonstrated small changes in QT interval, T wave amplitude and variability of T wave complexity in subjects exposed to UFP. We observed both early and late changes in T wave amplitude. It is possible that changes at earlier lags may be induced directly by changes via the autonomic nervous system or via changes in endothelial function (which was observed in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] in the same study population), and changes at later lags may be triggered by inflammatory reactions.</p><p>Recent epidemiological and controlled exposure studies have reported small increases in BPsys and BPdia in association with PM at the same day as well as during a 5-day-average up to a 30-day-average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The diabetic patients in our study showed an immediate decrease in BPsys and then a much delayed increase of BPsys and BPdia at a lag of 4 days. However, Ibald-Mulli et al. (2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] also found small significant decreases in systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure in association with PM. We have not observed changes in blood pressure in studies in which volunteers were exposed to CAPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and Brook et al. (2002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] did not observe changes in blood pressure in healthy subjects in a controlled exposure study with inhalation of fine CAPs and ozone. However, Urch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] reported an early increase in BPdia after controlled exposure to CAPs and ozone with the magnitude of the BPdia change being associated with the PM<sub>2.5 </sub>carbon content.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect modification</title><p>Studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] have shown that patient characteristics such as high BMI or diseases like diabetes or hypertension increase the associations between PM and health outcomes. Obesity represents a pro-inflammatory state and as such may increase susceptibility to air pollution by increasing the response to inflammatory stimuli. We previously reported that markers of insulin resistance such as obesity and poor glycemic control as indicated by elevated HbA1c and low adiponectin were associated with a larger PM-associated decrease in endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Here we show a similar finding for IL-6, RBC and total hemoglobin. Somewhat surprisingly, we observed that, while these patient characteristics were associated with increased PM-associated levels of IL-6, TNF&#x003b1; was increased more in those patients with lower BMI and better insulin control. Although both of these cytokines are associated with inflammation, they do not always travel together. They can be secreted by different cells under different control mechanisms and for different purposes. Blood levels of IL-6, but not TNF&#x003b1; have also been reported to be an independent predictor of type 2 diabetes after adjustment for BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>We observed that individuals with elevated levels of blood ferritin had increased levels of IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; associated with PM exposure. Serum ferritin is an iron storage protein and considered a surrogate marker of total body iron levels. Higher levels of iron, often found in diabetic individuals, are hypothesized to make one more prone to inflammation and also to increase oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Excessive absorption and storage of dietary iron is also thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and its complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Ghio et al. (2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] reported that inhaled tobacco smoke particles were able to mobilize endogenous iron present in lung lining fluid, resulting in altered iron homeostasis, increased metal-dependent oxidative stress, and ultimately increased levels of pulmonary inflammation. It is possible that patients with higher ferritin-levels would have more iron available for complexing with any particles that enter the vascular system and would thus have more oxidative stress leading to higher levels of inflammatory markers. Consistent with this hypothesis, in our study individuals with ferritin levels above 60 ng/ml showed much stronger increases in IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; than those with lower ferritin levels.</p><p>Glutathione-S-transferase is a phase II enzyme which can scavenge oxygen-free radicals, metabolize reactive oxygen species and detoxify xenobiotics present in PM. People with a <italic>GSTM1 </italic>null allele are thought to handle oxidative stress less effectively and may be more responsive to agents such as PM which increase oxidative stress. The potential of this genotype to make carriers more susceptible to PM exposure has already been shown repeatedly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. We reported earlier that individuals with diabetes with the null <italic>GSTM1 </italic>polymorphism have the greatest PM-associated decreases in endothelial dysfunction. Here, we extend these findings by showing that individuals with diabetes carrying the null allele for <italic>GSTM1 </italic>also have the most pronounced changes in IL-6, RBC, total hemoglobin and MCV.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Excellent adherence to the protocol by the volunteers who attended all clinical visits is one of the study's strengths. Yet, the design with four successive visits in one week might not be optimal to detect changes in biomarkers having longer half-lives, such as fibrinogen. However, using first order autocorrelation as a covariance matrix to account for that autocorrelation between the data from consecutive days did not show strong influence on the effect estimation. Daily variations could have an influence on the health outcomes but models were adjusted for day of the week if AIC proved it to be necessary. Circadian variation was controlled by design, as measurements on every individual were taken at the same time of day.</p><p>A limitation of the study is the small number of individuals studied. While the numbers are adequate to observe associations between PM and pro-inflammatory cytokines, there was not enough power to exclude significant changes in other biomarkers related to inflammation and coagulation where only trends appeared. A major strength of the study was the simultaneous measurement of interacting ECG and blood markers, thereby establishing the temporal relationship of changes in physiological and biochemical responses to PM<sub>2.5 </sub>exposure, and providing insight into the potential mechanisms of air pollution effects. However, coagulation factors were measured as antigen levels, which don't necessarily reflect functional levels. As with any study that examines many different end points, multiple testing and as a consequence the potential for false-positive results can be a problem, especially with so many effect modifiers.</p><p>In this study we used daily PM<sub>2.5 </sub>mass values from a monitoring station located on the rooftop of the EPHD. In addition, PM<sub>2.5 </sub>values from a state monitoring station located 27 miles away from the EPHD were obtained. There was a strong correlation between these two sets of measurements, suggesting that we were accurately assessing ambient exposure of the study participants all living in a 30 mile radius of Chapel Hill. Thus, while ambient exposures are measured with some imprecision, these exposure measurement errors are non-differential with respect to either true ambient exposure or to the clinical measurements. As such, these Berkeson measurement errors will tend to bias our results towards the null. However, we have to acknowledge the possibility that the reported effect estimates might be modified by co-pollutants that were not measured. A further strength of this study is the investigation of air pollution effects in a particularly susceptible subgroup. On the other hand, the results cannot be generalized to the whole population.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Exposure to elevated levels of ambient fine particulate air pollution showed a cascade of responses in association with PM<sub>2.5</sub>. PM<sub>2.5 </sub>might immediately alter ventricular repolarization and increase myocardial vulnerability to arrhythmias, as well as induce systemic inflammation two days later suggesting that some mechanisms work quickly through physiological systems primed to respond quickly, while some require a greater length of time for the activated signaling pathways to translate the response. It is not clear whether the mechanisms are causally related or independent. This study provides further evidence that individuals with diabetes appear to be very sensitive to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, especially those with higher insulin resistance. This issue is elevated to a higher level of concern given that the prevalence of diabetes is likely to increase over the next two decades.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AS performed the statistical analyses and drafted the manuscript; LMN was involved in the design planning of the study as well as the analyses and interpretation of the data and revised the manuscript critically; DWG performed the analyses of the ECG markers and reviewed the manuscript critically; MCH was involved in the acquisition of the patient characteristics and health outcome data and reviewed the manuscript critically; WEC was substantially involved in the design of the study and reviewed the manuscript critically; MTS performed the analyses of some of the blood markers as well as performed the genotyping; JBB was involved in the enrollment of the diabetic individuals and reviewed the manuscript critically; AP was involved in the analyses and interpretation of the data; RBD was substantially involved in the design of the study, interpretation of the data and reviewed the manuscript critically;</p><p>All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional file 1</title><p><bold>Table S1: Description of PM<sub>2.5 </sub>and of meteorology parameters throughout the study period (19 Nov 2004 to 09 December 2005)</bold>. <bold>Table S2</bold>: Description of the inflammation and coagulation blood parameters (descriptive statistics was calculated from patient means). <bold>Table S3</bold>: Description of the blood panel parameters (descriptive statistics was calculated from patient means). <bold>Table S4</bold>: Description of the ECG and blood pressure parameters (descriptive statistics was calculated from patient means). <bold>Table S5</bold>: Correlation table for short-term (5 min.) repolarization markers. <bold>Table S6</bold>: Correlation table for short-term (5 min.)
