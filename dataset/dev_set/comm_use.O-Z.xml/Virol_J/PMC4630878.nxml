It is well established that patients with high serum HBV DNA levels are associated with worse prognosis than those with low or undetectable HBV DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, a major goal of clinical management of chronic HBV infection is to prevent progression of the liver injury and inflammation through sustained suppression of HBV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Currently, treatment mainly relies on long term use of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). NAs, especially new generation NAs including entecavir (ETV) can significantly inhibit viral replication to undetectable level in more than 80 % of treated patients, and normalize ALT in almost all of them following long term therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, HBeAg seroconversion facilitated by ETV treatment remains low with variable frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>HBeAg seroconversion is a critical event in natural course of chronic HBV infection and during the antiviral treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It coincides with naturally reduced replication or sustained suppression of viral replication by antivirals, and is linked with reduced risk for progression of liver injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Patients who have successfully experienced this switch usually become so-called inactive HBsAg carrier who shows low serum HBV DNA and normal ALT. Importantly, HBeAg seroconversion is accompanied by significantly reduced HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) level in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Reduced cccDNA level signals a better prospect for maintaining low level of HBV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. If patients stay at HBeAg positive phase, even though the liver inflammation has been brought under control, they may face a higher risk for quick restoration of high level of HBV replication because of relatively high intrahepatic cccDNA level once the antiviral therapy ceased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, HBeAg seroconversion is an important endpoint achieving a better outcome of antiviral therapy.</p><p>So far, several baseline and on-treatment predictors for HBeAg seroconversion have been suggested in the literature. Medium range of HBV DNA, higher ALT level, and lower serum HBsAg level are considered baseline predictors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] for HBeAg seroconversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition to viral factors, we reasoned that NAs mediated inhibition takes place within infected cells and efficient access to viral replication site in each of infected cells by the drug is essential for efficient inhibition function. Such access could be impeded if there is excessive accumulation of biologic molecules that clog intracellular traffic in hepatocytes. It is well-known that hepatic steatosis is increasingly prevalent. For instance, about 30 % of CHB patients concur with hepatic steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We hypothesized that metabolic factors can impact antiviral response and HBeAg seroconversion.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy leading to HBeAg seroconversion associated with long term ETV treatment and to build a model with the combined viral and metabolic factors and to assess predictive utility of the model for predicting HBeAg seroconversion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>Of enrolled 270 CHB patients with HBeAg positive, Forty-one patients, 14 (5.2 %) showed nonresponse at week 48 and they discontinued the ETV therapy, and 27 (10.0 %) had unavailable serum HBV DNA data at week 24 or 48, were excluded (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

According to the calculated individual probability and the cut-off values, patients were categorized to high (&#x0003e;40 %), intermediate (20 %-40 %), or low (&#x02264;20 %) HBeAg seroconversion group. Approximately 58 % of patients in the high probability group achieved HBeAg seroconversion compared with 11 % and 31 % in the low and intermediate probability groups, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The seroconversion frequencies were significantly different (p &#x0003c; 0.001). The cumulative rates of HBeAg seroconversion in the high response group were significant greater than another two groups at the same time points.

However, HBeAg seroconversion facilitated by ETV therapy remains relative low, for instance only about 20 % of HBeAg positive patients achieved HBeAg seroconversion after 48 weeks ETV therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Factors associated with HBeAg seroconversion are not well understood and it is difficult to predict HBeAg seroconversion. But an ability for physicians to accurately predict HBeAg seroconversion is needed to improve clinical management of patients with chronic hepatitis B. We investigated the antiviral efficacy of long term ETV treatment of HBeAg positive chronic HBV infected patients in this study. We found that ETV was a highly potent antiviral agent. The cumulative rates of VR and BR were comparable to those observed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We focused on identifying and testing both viral and metabolic factors, which were extracted from virologic and biochemical profiles at baseline and within 24 weeks of treatment, for impacting HBeAg seroconversion. We found that BMI values were inversely related to changes in HBeAg status, and serum HBV DNA, ALT values at baseline, as well undetectable HBV DNA level within 24 weeks after the treatment were positively related to HBeAg seroconversion. We constructed a model that incorporated both viral and metabolic factors, and can assign each patient with low, or medium or high probability for serum HBeAg seroconversion. The cumulative rate of HBeAg seroconversion at the end of 5 year treatment in this study was lower than previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Possible factors included that the dominant HBV strain in China is genotype C, which is associated with lower rates of seroconversion than genotypes A or B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Additionally, the subjects who discontinued therapy were considered as failure that may underestimate the actual conversion rates.</p><p>An interesting factor identified by this study was an indicator for abnormal metabolism: BMI (&#x02265;24kg/m<sup>2</sup>) that was inversely associated with HBeAg seroconversion. In agreement with this finding, we noted that patients with higher BMI showed poorer virologic response at early phrase (before 24 weeks). The poorer virologic response suggests an inefficient inhibition of viral replication, which may have contributed to delaying HBeAg seroconversion. Some studies previously indicated that BMI was an independent factor for hepatic steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. And hepatic steatosis was documented to have a negative effect on the therapy efficacy, and even it could result in ETV treatment failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Although conclusive data on the effect of steatosis remains to be established, a hypothesis is that not only viral factors, but also metabolic factors like hepatic steatosis in CHB patients are likely determining antiviral response including HBeAg seroconversion. It is possible that the contact between the HBV replication site and drug within hepatocytes could be separated or blocked by accumulated fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As a result of such separation, the drug may not effectively access to the viral replicating site . This difficulty may be further impeded by diminished activity of hepatic cytochromes in steatosis hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Additionally, patients with hepatitis C that is often marked by hepatic steatosis, are frequently accompanied by obesity and insulin resistance that may result in dysfunction of cellular immunesystem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Currently obesity is increasingly spreading among various populations even in developing countries, and lipid metabolism disorders such as hepatic steatosis occur more frequently among general population, It is not surprising that CHB patients can have hepatic steatosis and the prevalence for such co-existence is up to 30.5 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Further studies would be expected to focus on impacts of steatosis on antiviral response at molecular level, and it may call for new antiviral strategy for CHB patients with hepatic steatosis or higher BMI.</p><p>This study also revealed that undetectable HBV DNA within 24 weeks was the most important independent predictive factor for HBeAg seroconversion as its regression coefficient was the highest among the four predictive factors. The result is in line with previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore,the finding could be explained by the suggestion that antiviral therapy with NAs can induce partial restoration of immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which are necessary for the durable host-mediated control of infection. And it is thought that rapid HBV DNA suppression may reflect this restoration of immune response in the host by stimulating the T-cell response and enhancing the probability of reducing the HBeAg expression in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, HBV DNA level at 24 weeks is an essential marker to monitor HBeAg seroconversion in ETV treatment.</p><p>Apart from two factors mentioned above, relatively lower HBV DNA levels (&#x0003c;10<sup>7</sup> copies/ml) at baseline were independently associated with a stepwise increasing rate for the HBeAg seroconversion. A same finding was observed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Consistently, HBeAg seroconversion in patients treated with LDT can be predicted by baseline HBV DNA and ALT levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. ALT reflects liver injury/inflammation that could be triggered by the host immune response. Our result that a higher baseline ALT level (&#x02265;200 IU/L) was related to HBeAg seroconversion was similar to previous study by Tseng TC et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, levels of baseline ALT can be considered as a critical factor for predicting antiviral response including HBeAg seroconversion before tailoring antiviral treatment.</p><p>After identifying these four independent predictive factors, we constructed a formula that could assist physicians to predict approximately probability of HBeAg seroconversion for individual patients. As tested by this study, nearly 60 % of patients in the high probability group achieved HBeAg seroconversion. Interestingly extended study only resulted in a moderate increase in HBeAg seroconversion in the intermediate group. For those patients close monitor of HBV DNA before 48 weeks would be important to decide whether they were having an optimal treatment. In comparison, the cumulative rate of HBeAg seroconversion showed no additional increase in the low response group over time, suggesting that those patients may retain HBeAg for a long period despite long term ETV therapy. Therefore, patients with probability more than 40 % could have a great chance to achieve HBeAg seroconversion. Additionally, patients with BMI (&#x0003c;24Kg/m<sup>2</sup>), plus lower HBV DNA (&#x0003e;7 &#x0003c; 9log<sub>10</sub>copies/ml) and higher ALT (&#x02265;200IU/L) and HBV DNA undetectable before 24 weeks had a greater probability to develop seroconversion. The remaining patients were less likely for HBeAg seroconversion. Particularly, patients with BMI (&#x02265;24Kg/m<sup>2</sup>), high HBV DNA (&#x0003e;9 log<sub>10</sub>copies/ml) levels at baseline and detectable HBV DNA at 48 weeks were candidates for discontinued ETV treatment.</p><p>The cut-off values for the stratification of individual probability were decided by considering the natural history of CHB and recognized efficacy of ETV long-term treatment. According to prior studies, the annual incidence of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion is about 2&#x02013;15 %, and thus 20 % was chosen as the lower cut-off value to exclude spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The probability of HBeAg seroconversion under ETV five years&#x02019; therapy is approximately 40 % or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], thus this value was selected as the upper cut-off line.</p><p>However, the predictive factors included in this study are not exhaustive, as some known risk factors were omitted, instead of using several easily available parameters. The hepatic steatosis was not included because ultrasound based detection of steatosis shows lower sensitivity and specificity, which largely depends on the operators&#x02019; skill. Recently, quantitative HBeAg and HBsAg levels have been shown to have predictive value for HBeAg seroconversion in ETV-treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the accurate HBeAg and HBsAg values were not available in this study, so those markers could not be assessed. Likewise, core promoter or pre-core mutations might represent additional factors for loss of HBeAg expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], but they are not routinely monitored in clinic. Therefore, the predictive power of this model for HBeAg seroconversion can be augmented if all predictive factors are incorporated.</p><p>This study is associated with a few limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small and the age range of patients was narrow because the HBeAg positive patients tend to be younger. The conclusions should be confirmed by future studies with large cohorts from multicenter. Second, all of our patients were Asians; therefore, it should be cautious to see if results can be extrapolated to other ethnic or genotypic patients. Finally, a lack of validated group to verify the prospective model is one challenge for all similar studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Long-term ETV treatment was effective. Baseline HBV DNA and ALT levels and undetectable HBV DNA within 24 weeks were positive markers while BMI value was a negative factor for HBeAg seroconversion. Our model can separate treated HBeAg positive patients into three categories with differentiated probabilities. We tested and found that HBeAg seroconversion can be as high as 60 % in high probability group. The model may have potential to be incorporated into a clinical rate-prediction instrument that could improve the antiviral efficacy through appropriate choice at baseline, which could result in timely adjustment of regimen for individual patients. However, the observation should be confirmed in a prospective and larger numbers of patients study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study population</title><p>This was a prospective cohort study that consecutively enrolled patients who entered the multicenter trial studies (CTR20132358) in the Department of Infectious Diseases, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between March 2006 and April 2013.
