After ethylene application, both fresh yield and dry matter of latex are substantially improved. Moreover, we found that ethylene improves the generation of small rubber particles. However, most genes involved in rubber biosynthesis are inhibited by exogenous ethylene. Therefore, we conducted a proteomics analysis of ethylene-stimulated rubber latex, and identified 287 abundant proteins as well as 143 ethylene responsive latex proteins (ERLPs) with mass spectrometry from the 2-DE and DIGE gels, respectively. In addition, more than 1,600 proteins, including 404 ERLPs, were identified by iTRAQ. Functional classification of ERLPs revealed that enzymes involved in post-translational modification, carbohydrate metabolism, hydrolase activity, and kinase activity were overrepresented. Some enzymes for rubber particle aggregation were inhibited to prolong latex flow, and thus finally improved latex production. Phosphoproteomics analysis identified 59 differential phosphoproteins; notably, specific isoforms of rubber elongation factor and small rubber particle protein that were phosphorylated mainly at serine residues. This post-translational modification and isoform-specific phosphorylation might be important for ethylene-stimulated latex production. These results not only deepen our understanding of the rubber latex proteome but also provide new insights into the use of ethylene to stimulate rubber latex production.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>It has long been known that although ethylene stimulates natural rubber production, many genes involved in natural rubber biosynthesis are not induced upon treatment with ethephon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Rubber latex is the cytoplasm of specialized cells called laticifers located in the bark phloem of rubber tree (<italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic>), the only plant commercially cultivated to produce natural rubber<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The rubber particle, a specific organelle found in rubber latex, is the only site of rubber biosynthesis and storage in laticifers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Natural rubber (cis-1,4-polyisoprene) is generated from rubber latex by a living carbocationic polymerization process that includes initiation, elongation and termination steps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. It is known that natural rubber biosynthesis occurs through a menvalonate (MVA) pathway that is catalyzed by many enzymes and cofactors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and begins with the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). In an early step, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (HMGS) and reductase (HMGR) activate the stored substrate. Rubber transferase (cis-prenyl transferase, CIPT) utilizes pyrophosphates to initiate rubber molecule synthesis, as well as IPP to form the polymer, and is thus a key enzyme in rubber biosynthesis. During elongation, rubber elongation factor (REF) and small rubber particle protein (SRPP) play key roles, and in isoprenoid biosynthesis, farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FADS) catalyzes the last common substrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>The use of ethylene has led to a technological revolution in natural rubber production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. As demonstrated in a <sup>14</sup>C labeling experiment, ethylene was released from the zone to the upper leaf shortly after the introduction of an ethylene generator, such as ethephon or ethrel (chloro-2-ethyl phosphonic acid)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In addition, the treatment of rubber tree bark with ethephon induces fresh latex production and stimulates latex regeneration between tappings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. This stimulation is associated with obvious changes in both the physiology and metabolism of laticifers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. As a result, ethylene-mediated technology is currently widely used in commercial latex production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Paradoxically, the expression of most genes involved in rubber biosynthesis are inhibited or unchanged upon ethylene stimulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Therefore, some researchers have even speculated that ethylene has little direct effect on rubber biosynthesis and have suggested that increases in latex yield could be attributed to a prolongation of latex flow<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Of the three key enzymes involved in rubber biosynthesis initiation, it has been reported that <italic>FADS</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and <italic>CIPT</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> are not significantly affected by ethylene.</p><p>The third enzyme, HMGR, has 3 family members named <italic>hmgr1</italic>, <italic>hmgr2</italic> and <italic>hmgr3</italic> in rubber tree; while <italic>hmgr1</italic> is induced by ethylene, stimulation does not influence its enzyme activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In the first reported accelerative effect of ethephon on rubber biosynthesis, HMGS gene expression and enzyme activity were significantly enhanced upon the addition of ethylene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>Based on these observations, we considered whether the regulation of rubber latex production by ethylene stimulation might occur not solely at the gene level but also at the protein level, with post-translational modifications (PTMs) playing crucial roles in controlling the final function of enzymes involved in rubber biosynthesis. We therefore conducted an in-depth comparative proteomics analysis of rubber latex exposed to different ethylene treatments and obtained the first comprehensive latex proteome profiles. In our study, 143 and 404 ethylene-responsive latex proteins (ERLPs) were generated by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), respectively, and 59 differentially expressed phosphoproteins were identified <italic>via</italic> phosphoproteomics analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth comprehensive proteomics analysis of rubber latex following ethylene stimulation, and this information may help uncover new mechanisms for the stimulation of rubber latex production.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethylene significantly improved rubber latex yield and small rubber particle generation</title><p>The effects of ethylene stimulation are more obvious in virgin plants than in mature trees<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. A low-frequency tapping procedure referred to as &#x0201c;half-spiral and once tapping in three days plus ethrel&#x0201d; is the recent method of choice for latex collection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Therefore, we used this procedure on virgin plants in this study. Overall, ethylene stimulation sharply improved the yield of fresh latex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and dry matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Before treatment, approximately 5&#x02009;ml of latex was recovered per plant. After ethylene treatment for 3 and 5 days, the volume of recovered latex reached &#x0223c;17 and 12&#x02009;ml, respectively. Compared with the control, ddH<sub>2</sub>O-treated plants also exhibited a significant increase in latex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), which were attributed to the mechanical effects of wounding caused by tapping<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Consistent with reported results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, ethylene also improved the latex water content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and markedly prolonged the latex flow time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). <italic>Hevea</italic> rubber particles are spherical or pear-shaped, measuring approximately 0.02&#x02013;3.0&#x02009;&#x003bc;m diameter and, based on their bimodal size distribution, including both large and small rubber particles (LRPs and SRPs, respectively)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In this study, the accumulation of SRPs was visibly induced by ethylene stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e&#x02013;g</xref>). In control, LRPs were the most frequently observed rubber particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). After tapping, the number of SRPs increased substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Notably, almost all examined rubber particles were SRPs following three days of ethylene (E-3) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Recently, SRPP protein in SRPs has been reported to play a more important role than REF does in LRP natural rubber biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Taken with these reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, our observations suggest that the ethylene stimulation of rubber latex can likely be attributed to the generation of SRPs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification and functional analysis of abundant proteins in rubber latex</title><p>To determine the protein profile of latex, the main proteins on both 1-DE and 2-DE gels were subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The main bands of different latex fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) were excised for in-gel digestion, and 35 proteins were positively identified. Then, the abundant protein spots (Vol%&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.01) on the 2-DE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) were subjected to MS analysis. Finally, 252 proteins were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1; Table S1</xref>). Among them, 121 proteins were identified from <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic>, and 36 proteins were from <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2a; Table S1</xref>). Radial chart analysis revealed that more than 90% of the proteins were distributed between the cyclical line 0.6 and 1.2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2b</xref>). These latex proteins belonged to 16 functional groups, the largest of which included 38 proteins involved in post-translational modification, followed by the categories of carbohydrate transport and metabolism, energy production, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1; Fig. S2c</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) pathway and biological process analysis verified that most of the proteins identified were involved in carbohydrate metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2d</xref>). An additional 19 proteins were related to abiotic stress responses, followed by 17 proteins involved with glycolysis. By GO cell biological analysis, 42 protein species were found to be overrepresented in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2e</xref>), in agreement with the fact that rubber latex is present in the cytoplasm of laticifers in <italic>Hevea</italic> phloem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Ten proteins belonged to the phosphopyruvate hydratase complex. TargetP analysis revealed that most latex proteins had no specific subcellular location. Only 11, 5, and 2 proteins localized to the secretary pathway, plastid, and mitochondrion, respectively. Finally, GO functional analysis demonstrated that the largest group of proteins was involved in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding, followed by metal ion binding and hydrolase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>), indicating that proteins with ATP-binding activity might play crucial roles in latex.</p><p>Analysis of protein abundance revealed that most abundant protein spots contained REF isoforms, followed by SRPP and elicitor-responsive proteins. Prohevein, a 50-kDa protein, and chitinase were also enriched in latex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2g</xref>). Notably, several spots found at different locations on 2-DE gels were identified as isoforms or different species of the same protein. For example, a total of 21 spots (17.2%) were identified as REF, and at least 13 spots (5.9%) were identified as SRPP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2i</xref>), indicating that REF and SRPP are the two most abundant proteins in latex.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Determination and identification of ERLPs by 2-D DIGE and iTRAQ</title><p>2-D DIGE was performed to identify ERLPs. Typical DIGE gels for each treatment and the combined images are presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;h</xref>). The global protein patterns on DIGE gels with &#x0223c;1750&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;38 spots remained consistent, and 143 protein spots (termed D1-D143) with a more than 1.3-fold change (confidence&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;95%) following ethylene treatment were positively identified by MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3; Table S2</xref>). In 3-day treated latex, 41 proteins had increased, while 43 had decreased. The top five induced proteins were mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), aspartic proteinase precursor, enolase, regulator of ribonuclease, and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (CAMT). Following 5 days of ethylene treatment, a greater number of differential proteins was observed. Among them, 50 proteins, including rubber elongation factor isoforms, Hev b7.02, esterase and proteasome, had increased, while 55 had decreased. Notably, although most spots containing rubber biosynthesis-related proteins, such as REF and SRPP, did not change significantly, some of their family members or isoforms were sharply increased by ethylene treatment. With regard to REF, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> isoforms were significantly changed after ethylene treatment, including 10 that were sharply induced (D25, 27, 30, 32, 65, 86, 96, 139, 142 and 143). With regard to SRPP, at least 5 protein isoforms (D52, 66, 67, 99 and 104) increased. However, glucanase and hevein - two key activators of lutoid-mediated rubber particle aggregation (RPA) and sequential latex coagulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> -were decreased upon ethylene treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3; Table S2</xref>). The decrease of accumulation of glucanase and hevein in ethylene-treated latex may inhibit RPA, thus maintaining latex flow.</p><p>Furthermore, iTRAQ was performed to detect additional ERLPs. The volcano plot p-values for the changed patterns of all identified proteins with 95% peptides &#x0003e;2 upon ethylene stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), the typical peptide of the protein I-23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), the false discovery rates for the ranked proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and reported protein confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>) at both the local and global levels, the cumulative reverse values for the ranked spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>), and the statistical values of proteins, peptides and spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>) are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. Finally, 1,596&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;50 unique proteins (termed as protein I1-I1621) were identified from 14,977 distinct peptide sequences with 95% confidence (score higher than 1.3; error factor &#x0003c;2). Among them, 1,330&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;45 proteins were identified with 99% confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4; Table S3</xref>). Similar to the results obtained by 2-DE, REF was the most abundant protein with 553 matched peptides, followed by SRPP and hevamine. Abundant proteins, including glucanase, Hev b7.02, HEV1.2, elicitor-responsive protein, Hev b5, pro-hevein, ACAT and enolase, were identified by iTRAQ. Although many abundant proteins [e.g., REF (I1), SRPP (I4), and hevamine (I6)] showed no significant changes in general, some of their family members or protein isoforms (e.g., I63, I357 and I1207 for REF; I39 for SRPP) changed substantially upon ethylene treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>), consistent with our observation in DIGE gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>After ethylene treatment, 404 proteins were significantly changed more than 1.5 fold. After 3 days of treatment, 140 proteins were substantially induced. Among them, the most highly induced was hydrolase, followed by an isoform of glucanase, potassium channel protein, ribosomal protein, galactosyltransferase, myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase, and kinase receptor. In contrast, 264 proteins were down-regulated upon treatment. Among them were peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, lactoylglutathione lyase, and thioredoxin. After increasing the ethylene treatment time to 5 days (E-5), most ERLPs demonstrated accumulation patterns similar to E-3 latex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4; Table S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phosphoproteomics analysis of rubber latex upon ethylene stimulation</title><p>When the differentially expressed proteins recovered from DIGE and iTRAQ methods were combined, we noticed a large amount of ERLPs with phosphatase/phosphotransferase activity (33 proteins) and kinase activity (22 proteins). At the biological process level, 39 proteins actively responded to cadmium ions. Among them, 10 proteins showed phosphate-binding activity, and 7 proteins had strong phosphopyruvate hydratase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3; Fig. S4</xref>). These results indicated that phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of proteins might be important in the ethylene-stimulation of rubber latex and suggested that rubber latex contains many phosphorylated enzymes.</p><p>Therefore, we confirmed the presence of phosphorylated proteins in rubber latex. Using Pro-Q Diamond dye, phosphospecific proteins in latex exposed to different ethylene treatment conditions were visualized and more than 200 protein spots were detected in 2-DE gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). In the merged image of the Pro-Q Diamond- and SYPRO Ruby-stained gels, specific phosphorylated protein spots red in color were clearly observed. Many protein spots were visualized by Pro-Q Diamond for latex under the D-0 and D-3 treatments, indicating that these proteins were phosphorylated under control conditions. However, the phosphorylation was substantially more apparent after ethylene treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Finally, the main spots of differentially expressed phosphoproteins were subjected to MS, and 59 differential proteins (Spots P1-P59) were positively identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5; Table S4</xref>). Among these phosphoproteins, REF (P19-21 and P36) was the most abundant, followed by the 7 isoforms of SRPP (P5, 6, 9, 17 and 38&#x02013;40) and one glucanase isoform (P45). Other abundant phosphorylated proteins included malate dehydrogenase, cytoplasmic aldolase, linamarase, latex patatin homolog, Hev b7, and several hypothetical proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5; Table S4</xref>). A large portion, including phosphoesterase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglucomutase, phospholipase, and 14-3-3 protein, had high phosphotransferase and kinase activity. These enzymes were involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and signal transduction.</p><p>Although the main spots containing REF and SRPP were not stained red, several isoforms of REF (P19-21 and P36) and SRPP (P5, 6 and 39) did stain as phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), indicating that isoform-specific phosphorylation might has a positive correlation between phosphoprotein abundance and ethylene-stimulated rubber latex production. To determine which amino acid sites in SRPP were phosphorylated, spot P6 was collected from six independent 2-DE gels and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), which revealed residue-specific phosphorylation. For example, the phosphorylation probability of the third serine (Ser-3) in the peptide QVSAQTYSVAQDAPR was 98.48%, while this value was only 0.03% in Ser-8. For threonine (T6), the phosphorylation probability was 1.48%. This value in tyrosine (Y7) was as low as 0.04% in this peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>). These results provided evidence that some SRPP isoforms are phosphorylated and that the most phosphorylated site in SRPP was serine, followed by threonine and tyrosine.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional analysis and clustering of ERLPs in rubber latex</title><p>ERLPs identified by DIGE (143 proteins, D1-D143) and iTRAQ (404 proteins) from E-3 and/or E-5 treatments, as well as the 59 differential phosphoproteins (P1-P59), were plotted in a Venn diagram, which revealed 92 shared protein spots representing 11 unique proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a&#x02013;c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5; Tables S2&#x02013;S4</xref>): REF; SRPP; hevein; 14-3-3 protein; HSP70; glucanase; latex abundant protein; ELRP; Hev b7.02; phosphoglycerate kinase; and nucleoredoxin. Moreover, 135 protein species were shared between DIGE and iTRAQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Of the up-regulated proteins, 38 were presented in all experiments and represented 4 unique proteins (REF, SRPP, Gluc and HSP70; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). In DIGE and iTRAQ, we identified 33 shared up-regulated protein species, including ETIF, ubiquitin, V-ATPase, glutathione-S-transferase, proteasome, aminopeptidase, esterase, HSP18 and RNA helicase. In addition, 9 unique proteins were down-regulated in all three experiments. In both DIGE and iTRAQ, 14 unique down-regulated proteins were identified, including chitinase, HMGR or HMGS, ubiquitin, proteasome, enolase, G3PD, and a 50-kDa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5; Tables S3 and S4</xref>).</p><p>Next, we classified all differentially expressed proteins by COG into 16 functional groups. Among them, the largest group was the post-translational modification-related chaperones (59 protein species), followed by carbohydrate transport and metabolism (46 proteins) and energy production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>). GO analysis of the differentially expressed proteins was performed for the categories of cellular component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d&#x02013;f</xref>), biological process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g&#x02013;i</xref>) and molecular function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6j&#x02013;l</xref>). For cellular component, the largest group was overrepresented in the cytoplasm (80 proteins), which is consistent with the fact that rubber latex is itself in the cytoplasm of laticifers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Another large group was located in the plasma membrane (48 proteins). Forty-six proteins were located in the nucleolus, suggesting that ethylene stimulation activated gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). After ethylene treatment, many proteins located in the nucleolus, ribosome, apoplast and endoplasmic reticulum were induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>), whereas a large group that localized to the cytoskeleton/microtubules, cytoplasm, intracellular compartments and cell wall was down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>).</p><p>Biological process and GO pathway analysis revealed that the largest group of ERLPs was involved in responding to cadmium ions (30 proteins). The second largest group, containing 28 proteins, was involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Some other important biological processes, such as lipid metabolism, proteolysis, glycolysis, protein transport, and translation were overrepresented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>). Many up-regulated proteins were involved in ATP hydrolysis, the lipid metabolic process, vesicle-mediated transport, or gene translation. However, proteins involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis (7 proteins), chitin catabolism (7 proteins) and aminoacylation were obviously decreased upon ethylene treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>). Molecular function analysis demonstrated that the largest group of proteins (66 proteins) was involved in ATP binding, followed by metal ion binding (59 proteins), nucleic acid binding, hydrolase activity, phosphotransferase activity (33 proteins) and kinase activity (22 proteins). Of the induced proteins, most were involved in nucleic acid binding, ribosome activity, catalytic activity or hydrolase activity. In contrast, proteins involved in metal ion binding, aminopeptidase, GTPase, chitinase and oxidoreductase were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6j&#x02013;l</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Integrative analysis of the proteins and genes involved in ethylene-stimulation of latex production</title><p>To further evaluate the correlation between the protein and transcript abundance, 65 ERLPs were selected for RT-PCR to assess gene expression patterns.

Compared with untreated plants, almost all proteins were induced after both water (mainly for wounding) and ethylene treatments except for HYDL, LACG and GGDS. For longer time periods, most induced proteins, including HMGS, REF, SRPP, ETHI, GLUR, SOD and peroxidase, decreased to some extent. However, some proteins, including PHOK, MEVK and HSP70, were most abundant in the 5-day-treated latex. Although most proteins were induced after tapping, ethylene stimulation did not enhance this trend. Compared with water, ethylene obviously improved the expression of some proteins following a 3-day treatment, including SUCT, MEVK, CIST, SOD, CDPK, ETHI, ETHR, CYAS, ACPX, aquaporin, GGDS and HSP70. However, protein and cognate transcript abundance for most rubber biosynthesis enzymes, including HMGR, HMGS, FADS and SRPP, were not significantly improved upon treatment with exogenous ethylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>), similar to observations made in our iTRAQ experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p>Given our in-depth proteomics analysis of rubber latex following ethylene treatment and the recent findings reported in the literatures, we have summarized the putative subcellular localization and main function of the identified proteins and have proposed a schematic for their regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>).

To improve latex proteomics study, we developed a protocol for latex protein preparation and generated high-resolution 2-DE protein profiles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Then, we identified 169 lutoid protein species and found that combination of chitinase and glucanase is crucial for lutoid-mediated RPA and latex coagulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>In this work, we provide the first high-resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">reference 2</xref>-DE profiles of rubber latex and identified almost all abundant latex proteins on 2-DE gels by MS.

By iTRAQ, we identified more than 1,600 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4; Table S3</xref>). In the past decade, only 313 proteins in total have been identified in the rubber tree, and among all rubber-producing plants, the number of proteins has only reached 1,208<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Of these, a large portion (803 proteins) were identified in lettuce latex by tandem MS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Compared with previously reported work, this study has generated the most latex proteins and provided the best protein profiles for rubber latex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Among the identified rubber latex proteins, REF, known as Hev b1, facilitates the elongation of the CIPT molecule to the isoprene subunit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. It is tightly bound to rubber particles and coats the interface between aqueous serum and polyisoprene molecules. REF, with its highly charged N-terminus, comprises 10% to 60% of the total protein found in latex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Our 2-DE results demonstrated that at least 17.2% of the protein found in latex was REF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). In iTRAQ, 553 peptides were generated from REF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). Hevein, glucanase and chitinase are the three main proteins in lutoids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Our results revealed that these proteins were enriched in total latex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1; Table S1</xref>). Functional analysis indicated that most latex proteins were involved in post-translational modification, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy production. These proteins were mainly located in the cytoplasm and play crucial roles in ATP binding, metal ion binding, abiotic stress responses, glycolysis, and catalysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>). These results are consistent with the observations of latex transcriptomics experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and rubber genome analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.

It is a key enzyme involved in nitrogen assimilation that catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine, which is required for latex regeneration, from ammonium and glutamate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In rubber tree, the activities of several enzymes, including glutamine synthetase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> and chitinase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, were specifically modulated upon ethylene treatment. In particular, ethylene increased invertase activity, which resulted in glycolysis acceleration, and finally increased the supply of carbon sources for rubber biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Sucrose, as a unique precursor of carbon sources used in rubber biosynthesis, is converted to mevalonate through an intermediate of acetyl-CoA in a NAD(P)H-dependent manner, but must cross the lactifer plasma membrane with the help of a sucrose transporter before being metabolized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Accordingly, enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were activated, and the gene expression of several sucrose transporters in <italic>Hevea</italic> bark tissues and latex-producing cells were induced by ethylene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Several aquaporins were also up-regulated upon ethylene stimulation through the regulation of water exchange between the inner liber and latex cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Therefore, ethylene altered membrane permeability, prolonged latex flowing time, and as a feedback, finally regenerated the basic metabolism of rubber latex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>In this proteomics analysis, we obtained 222 ethylene-induced proteins, many of which were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). In DIGE gels, MAPK was markedly induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). MAPK plays a role in ethylene signaling by controlling phosphatase activity to improve root cell expansion and is known to induce ethylene biosynthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In the rubber tree, MAPK expression was induced upon jasmonate and ethylene stimulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The onset of TPD syndrome is triggered by MAPK which regulated MYB transcription factor to induce programmed cell death in rubber tree bark<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In addition, aspartic proteinase precursor increased 1.75 fold after treatment with ethylene for 3 days; however, when the treatment was extended to 5 days, its expression was substantially inhibited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3; Table S2</xref>). This laticifer protein was also detected by 2-DE in <italic>C. procera</italic> latex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, and it is known to play a defensive role in rubber latex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Enolase, also called 2-phosphoglycerate dehydratase or 2-phospho D-glycerate hydrolase, is ubiquitous in rubber-producing plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and in many living organisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In model plants, phosphoenolpyruvate enolase is associated with an abnormal phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. This enzyme is a key player in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the carbohydrate metabolism pathway, where it catalyzes the reversible conversion of 2-phosphoglyceric acid to phosphoenolpyruvic acid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. This enzyme was detected in the C-serum of rubber latex and was identified as Hev b9 in a proteomics analysis of rubber latex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. It was also enriched in LRPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Herein, we detected two induced enolase isoforms (D-6 and D-33) and one decreased isoform (Enolase 1, D-108) after ethylene stimulation. In iTRAQ, this enzyme was generally down-regulated upon the addition of ethylene. Similarly, its gene expression was inhibited by ethylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p>In DIGE, a CAMT isoform (D-62) was induced by ethylene. CAMT is important for lignification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and is induced upon ethylene and jasmonate stimulation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In addition, CAMT is highly expressed in a high-yielding rubber tree clone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. However, this enzyme was generally decreased in our iTRAQ experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). In the 5-day-treated latex, esterase (Hev b13), an enzyme similar to hydroxynitrile lyase that is involved in plant defense, was obviously increased. Proteasome and Hev b7.02 were also induced. However, the levels of these proteins were low in 3-day-treated latex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>), and the esterase gene was inhibited by ethylene treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). In iTRAQ, the most increased protein was hydrolase (31.3 fold), which hydrolyzes O-glycosyl compounds and is involved in many processing events in the vegetative vacuoles of plant cells, ranging from general metabolism to defense<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Hydrolase can also help to release ammonia from nitrogenous substrates under ethylene treatment through the modification of the membrane properties of glutamine synthetase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Here, we noticed that all hydrolase family members were significantly increased upon ethylene treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). This protein was enriched in the latex of plants attacked by butterflies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and in the self-rooting juvenile clones of the rubber tree<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, and its gene was highly expressed in the latex of a high-yielding rubber tree clone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In addition, a potassium channel protein (I-713) was induced upon ethylene treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4; Table S3</xref>). This protein, in addition to V-ATPase, aids in the uptake of sugar and sucrose by facilitating their transfer across the plasma membrane in laticifer protoplast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.</p><p>As an early response to ethylene, the total amount of adenine nucleotides (i.e., ATP and ADP) in the adenylate pool, as well as the transtonoplast &#x00394;pH within <italic>Hevea</italic> latex cell, are increased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.

We observed that V-ATPase, an ATP-driven enzyme that transforms the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, was significantly induced upon ethylene. In rubber latex, this enzyme catalyzes vacuolar acidification and controls the availability of its substrate ATP and then activates energy-dependent metabolism during rubber latex production following ethylene stimulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. A mitochondrial ATP synthase (I-188) was also induced by ethylene. This enzyme, together with other plasma-type ATPases (P-ATPases), is crucial for ethylene sensing <italic>via</italic> copper transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p><p>Many of the induced proteins identified in this study are involved in ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and energy production. Among them, CDPK5 was increased after 3 days of ethylene treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4; Table S3</xref>). It appears likely that CDPK, as well as MAPK, play a role in the ethylene signaling pathway by controlling phosphatase activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> and sucrose metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>In the 402 down-regulated latex proteins, most enzymes, including prohevein/hevein, chitinase/hevamine and glucanase, were involved in chitin catabolism. These are key factors in lutoids that regulate RPA and latex production after tapping<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Our results demonstrated that almost all the investigated isoforms of these proteins were significantly inhibited upon ethylene treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). Generally, hevein, chitinase and glucanase are the main three components of lutoid inclusions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. As defense-responsive proteins, they possess antimicrobial activity that is triggered in response to the presence of bacteria, insects, or fungi, and act to protect the cell or organism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In a previous proteomics analysis, we confirmed that these three proteins are present at high concentrations in lutoids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Chitinase, like hevamine, is a well-known plant defense protein that possesses lysozyme activity. It belongs to the chitinase class II subfamily of glycosyl hydrolases. A major difference between hevamine and chitinase is that the former is a basic protein localized in vacuoles, while the latter is an acidic extracellular one<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. An increase in chitinase activity results in a dramatic decrease in the detection of Glc-NAc on the 22-kDa hevein receptor, indicating a possible role for chitinase in removing sugar moieties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. These lines of evidence supported a role for chitinase in plugging the latex vessel and in stopping latex flow<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Glucanase (Hev b2) is enriched in the lutoid membrane and possesses hydrolase activity. It is a basic vacuolar glycoprotein that tightly interacts with rubber particle glycoproteins, such as SRPP and REF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. This interaction promotes the rapid aggregation of rubber particles, resulting in latex coagulation when lutoids burst upon tapping of the rubber tree<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Hevein, or its precursor pro-hevein, is suggested to be the most abundant lutoid protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Both hevein and pro-hevein showed a strong chitin binding ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Immuno-blotting analysis of hevein revealed both mature hevein and a 20-kDa protein recognized by N domain-specific antibody<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Hevein can also stimulate RPA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>.</p><p>Recently, based on a lutoid proteomics study, we proposed a new model for lutoid-mediated RPA. After tapping or other injury, rubber latex flows outside laticifers and the subsequent turgor pressure changes suddenly, resulting in the bursting of lutoids, which allows contact between chitinase and glucanase. When glucanase (an RPA activator) encounters the inhibitor chitinase in broken lutoids, rubber particles aggregate immediately and latex coagulates are formed, thus plugging latex vessel ends and inhibiting sustained latex flow<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Therefore, these three proteins in lutoids were considered to cause the negatively charged RPA and latex to coagulate in a rather narrow range of ratios of added proteins to rubber latex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment substantially inhibited the gene expression of hevein, chitinase and glucanase and, correspondingly, decreased their protein accumulation. The decrease in RPA-related enzymes, as well as the up-regulation of certain water and compound transportation proteins, such as aquaporin, potassium channel, exportin-1, invertase 2, and trafficking protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>), helped to inhibit RPA and prolonged the flow time of fresh latex, thus increasing the production of latex. We considered this process to be an important factor for ethylene-stimulated production of rubber latex.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethylene induced many nucleotide-binding and translation-related proteins but generally depressed rubber biosynthesis enzymes</title><p>Several reports have uncovered that the genes for certain regulated proteins, such as WRKY transcription factor 1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, 14-3-3 protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, metallothionein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, and ethylene-responsive factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> and peroxidase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, responded positively to ethylene stimulation.

Among them, the argonaute protein can bind a mature miRNA to guide a protein complex to target messages for post-transcriptional silencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. In the rubber tree, this protein showed transcription activity in response to stimulation or TPD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.

The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is the most-studied cytosolic pathway of rubber biosynthesis. Only in recent years has the plastidic methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway been considered a possible route for rubber biosynthesis by virtue of providing an alternative source of isopentenyl diphosphate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Although the expression of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) has been reported in <italic>Hevea</italic> latex and leaves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, the main enzymes in the MEP pathway were not detected in this study. Only G3PD, which acts at the first step of MEP pathway, was identified, but it decreased after ethylene stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>), indicating that the MEP pathway is not crucial for rubber biosynthesis.

These proteins are closely related to the yield and quality of natural rubber<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. CIPT, commonly called rubber transferase, localizes to the rubber particle membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. It produces rubber polymer (cis-1,4-polyisoprene) from IPP monomers, which it links in a chain-like manner to an allylic pyrophosphate (APP) initiator molecule. The rubber polymer grows as more isoprene units are added to the chain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Rubber transferase, activated by the metal ion cofactor Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>, is a key factor that determines the rubber-producing ability of rubber trees<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. In addition, the activity of rubber transferase in SRPs is higher than in LRPs. It has also been reported that SRPs are composed of linear rubber molecules void of chain-end groups for forming branch points, while LRPs contain branched rubber molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. These results, as well as our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e&#x02013;g</xref>), revealed that rubber transferase contained in SRPs may play additional important roles in ethylene-induced latex production. At the gene level, our observations, together with previously the reported results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, verified that CIPT1 and CIPT2 were repressed by ethylene. However, our results presented here show that ethylene significantly improved CIPT2 abundance in rubber latex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>In rubber tree, HMGR and HMGS are involved in early steps of rubber biosynthesis and demonstrate a positive response to IPP substrate. HMGR, a key regulatory enzyme, provides a backbone by catalyzing mevalonate synthesis from HMG-CoA for isoprenoids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Four HMGR (<italic>hmgr1-4</italic>) and two HMGS gene family members have been reported in rubber latex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Among them, <italic>hmgr1</italic>, an ethylene induced-gene, is responsible for rubber biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. However, ethylene did not influence the activity of HMGR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. It was reported in a recent study that ethylene influenced HMGS gene expression and improved its enzymatic activity, which was the first observation of the accelerative effect of ethylene on rubber biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Interestingly, we found the both gene and protein expression of HMGR and HMGS were inhibited by ethylene stimulation in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figs 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">8</xref>). ACAT catalyzes a Claisen-type condensation of two acetyl-CoA units to form acetoacetyl-CoA, which is recognized as the first step in the MVA pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. In rubber tree, there are three ACAT genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Our results revealed that although both the gene and protein expression of most ACAT isoforms was depressed, one isoform was induced by ethylene. Two other important enzymes in the MVA pathway, mevalonate disphosphate decarboxylase (MEVD) and mevalonate kinase (MEVK), were inhibited by ethylene at both the gene and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). During rubber elongation, REF and SRPP are key proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Our results revealed that although some family member proteins were markedly induced, REF and SRPP were not obviously changed at the gene or protein level upon ethylene treatment. This result is consistent with a report that neither ethylene treatment nor wounding changed the transcript level of the SRPP gene in <italic>Hevea</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. This study revealed that ethylene could not directly induce most of the key enzymes in the MVA pathway at either the gene or protein expression level during rubber biosynthesis and that its stimulating effect was dependent on the activation of a small number of enzymes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phosphorylation of specific isoforms of rubber biosynthesis-related enzymes might be important for ethylene-stimulated latex production</title><p>During ethylene signal transduction, MAPK cascades often regulate transcription directly by phosphorylating transcription factors.

In rubber biosynthesis, the monomer IPP is phosphorylated to form an enzyme-IPP adduct, which is able to repeat and sustain IPP addition by the simultaneous loss of pyrophosphoric acid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. It is known that 14-3-3 isoforms can bind to phosphorylated client proteins to modulate their function, and the selective phosphorylation of 14-3-3 proteins at several known sites might be important for rubber biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. In rubber latex, ethylene treatment improved ATP hydrolysis to generate ADP and AMP, followed by the rapid dephosphorylation of AMP, thus reducing the total adenine nucleotide pool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In a proteomics analysis of rubber latex, 4 proteins were found in the combinatorial peptide ligand libraries that are known to be involved in phosphorylation processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>.

Genes encoding REF and SRPP have been cloned, and various isoforms have been identified. In addition, tapping is known to stimulate their gene expression. REF expression positively correlates with latex yield, and the amount of REF in latex is proportional to its rubber content. REF and SRPP are acidic proteins and are not believed be post-translationally modified in <italic>Hevea</italic> latex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>.

In our phosphoproteomics study, we found that at least 4 isoforms of REF and 7 SRPP family members were phosphorylated and that SRPP was phosphorylated at a serine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5; Table S4</xref>).</p><p>Based on the aforementioned comprehensive proteomics analysis and the recent literatures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>, we proposed an intrinsically cellular-based mechanism associated with both the detailed localizations and the response mechanisms of main latex proteins after ethylene stimulation, and then suggested a new scheme of the ethylene-induced biochemical pathways in rubber latex cells at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). Similar to previous gene expression analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>, our proteomics data revealed that mechanical wounding and ethylene stimulation induced many biochemical processes in laticifers, such as starch and sucrose metabolism, sucrose and glucose loading, water uptake and transport, nitrogen assimilation, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, hydrolase activity, metal ion binding, ATP binding, energy production, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and kinase activity, and post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). In contrast, the enzymes involved in RPA and latex coagulation were markedly inhibited upon ethylene stimulation, which depressed the formation of rubber coagulates in the vessel and subsequently prolonged the latex flow time. Natural rubber biosynthesis might be enhanced <italic>via</italic> a feedback mechanism; some isoforms of key rubber biosynthesis enzymes such as REF, SRPP and CIPT2 were activated by phosphorylation. Ethylene also increased the generation of SRPs, which are more important for rubber biosynthesis than LRPs. Finally, the natural rubber latex yield was significantly improved after treatment with exogenous ethylene. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth quantitative proteomics study of rubber latex upon ethylene stimulation, and the first report proposing a role for the phosphorylation of REF and SRPP. We proposed that phosphorylation of specific isoforms of several key enzymes might have a positive correlation between phosphoprotein abundance and the ethylene-stimulation of rubber latex production.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant material and ethylene treatment</title><p>A total of 90 newly tapped mature (&#x0223c;8-year-old) rubber trees (<italic>H.
