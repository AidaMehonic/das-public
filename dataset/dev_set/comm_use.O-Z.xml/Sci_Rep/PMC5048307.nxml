Unlike previous research that focused on Cr(VI)-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis, this study placed emphasis on premature senescence that can be induced by low-dose and long-term Cr(VI) exposure. We found Cr(VI) induced premature senescence in L-02 hepatocytes, as confirmed by increase in senescence associated-&#x003b2;-galactosidase (SA-&#x003b2;-Gal) activity. Cr(VI) stabilized p53 through phosphorylation at Ser15 and increased expression of p53-transcriptional target p21. Mechanism study revealed Cr(VI) targeted and inhibited mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (MRCC) I and II to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. By applying antioxidant Trolox, we also confirmed that ROS mediated p53 activation. A tetracycline-inducible lentiviral expression system containing shRNA to p53 was used to knockout p53. We found p53 could inhibit pro-survival genes B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), myeloid leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and S phase related cell cycle proteins cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), Cyclin E to induce premature senescence, and the functional role of ROS in Cr(VI)-induced premature senescence is depend on p53. The results suggest that Cr(VI) has a role in premature senescence by promoting ROS-dependent p53 activation in L-02 hepatocytes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Chromium is an extremely important metal which can be found of various uses in industries such as metallurgy and textile dying<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Hexavalent Chromium [Cr(VI)] compounds exhibit high mobility in the environment and have been shown to exert toxic effects in most living organisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In addition, Cr(VI) is a human carcinogen by both the inhalation and oral route of exposure. Senescence, first described by Hayflick and Moorhead in human fibroblast cells in 1961<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, is characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest. Cellular senescence is the phenomenon by which normal diploid cells lose the ability to divide with telomere shortening, normally after 60 generations <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Senescent cells are flatter and larger than normal proliferating cells with increased &#x003b2;-galactosidase (&#x003b2;-gal) activity, which are different from apoptotic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Recently, another type of senescence named premature senescence, which occurs after only few replications cycles and being morphologically and biochemically similar to replicative senescence has been studied a lot<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Premature senescence can be triggered by multi-factors including oncogene activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, and xenobiotics exposure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which include free radicals such as superoxide (O<sub>2</sub>) and hydroxyl radicals (HO), are defined as oxygen-containing chemical species with reactive chemical properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) is the most important source of ROS within most cells. ROS produced from MRC complex (MRCC) are of pathological importance in a wide variety of degenerative diseases, aging, and cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.

From the second week of Cr(VI) treatment, cells although viable, appeared growth inhibition and acquired irregular shape which is typical of senescence phenotype.

In particular, many senescent cells accumulate specialized domains of facultative heterochromatin, called SAHF, which are thought to repress expression of proliferation-promoting genes, thereby contributing to senescence-associated proliferation arrest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. When stained with DAPI, senescent cells showed bright punctate DNA foci. The chromatin in these foci appears much more compact than the chromatin in normal interphase growing cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. SAHF is believed to be the main reason for the irreversibility of the aging process.

The finding led us to speculate that Cr(VI) could target MRCC I and II, the most susceptible sites to Cr(VI) toxicity to enhance ROS production. We then confirmed Cr(VI) inhibited these two complexes both in gene and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). SA-&#x003b2;-Gal stain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref> showed that pre-treatment with 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Trolox for 1&#x02009;h prior to Cr(VI) incubation could rescue Cr(VI)-induced premature senescence in L-02 hepatocytes. The alleviation of premature senescence after Trolox pre-treatment was also confirmed by the determination of the percentage of senescent cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F</xref>, only 10% of the hepatocytes became senescent after Cr(VI) exposure. Then we reached the conclusion that Cr(VI) induced premature senescence via ROS.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ROS mediated p53 activation in Cr(VI)-induced premature senescence</title><p>We determined p53 gene expression by real-time PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>, the expression of p53 was about 9-fold higher after Cr(VI) treatment compared with control, indicating the activation of p53 in the senescent cells. Trolox pre-treatment significantly decreased p53 expression levels in both the control and the Cr(VI) exposure group, revealing that ROS could transcriptionally regulate p53. It is generally believed that post-translational modifications like phosphorylation play a role in stabilizing p53 protein. After Cr(VI) treatment, p53 expression significantly increased in the senescent cells. Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser 15 exhibited a clear increase. In contrast, phosphorylation of N-terminal residue Ser 20 and C-terminal residue Ser 392 showed no change in response to stimulation with Cr(VI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is known to be the most important negative regulator of p53<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, and it has been confirmed that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylation of MDM2 is likely to be the key step in causing p53 stabilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. We examined ATM and MDM2 protein expressions and found that ATM showed increased protein level while MDM2 showed decreased protein level in the senescent cells induced by Cr(VI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Western blotting for senescence pathway analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref> revealed that p53-p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> pathway, but not Rb-p16<sup>INK4a</sup> pathway was involved in Cr(VI)-induced premature senescence. p53 and p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> was up-regulated after Cr(VI) exposure, while Rb and p16<sup>INK4a</sup> showed no significantly change compared with control group. Trolox pre-treatment resulted in almost undetectable p53 expression in both the control and Cr(VI) treatment group, indicating the role of ROS played in regulating p53 expression. Trolox also blocked the induction of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> in Cr(VI) treatment group, but did not alter the expressions of Rb and p16<sup>INK4a</sup>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Knocking-out p53 by siRNA blocks the induction of premature senescence in Cr(VI)-treated hepatocytes</title><p>We further checked if Cr(VI)-induced premature senescence was completely depend on p53 function. A Doxcycline-inducible lentiviral expression system containing shRNA to p53 was used to knockout p53 in hepatocytes. The non-target scramble (Scr)-transfected and p53 shRNA-transfected hepatocytes were treated with PBS or 10&#x02009;nM Cr(VI) twice a week for 24&#x02009;h for 4 consecutive weeks. Cr(VI) induced senescence in Scr cells but not in p53 shRNA cells, indicating the absence of p53 blocked the induction of senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). This was further confirmed by checking the percentage of senescent cells in the cultures. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>, about 75% of Scr cells in the Cr(VI) treatment group were showing SA-&#x003b2;-Gal activity (senescent cells). In contrast, more than 80% of p53 shRNA cells were actively dividing in the presence of the chemical, and the percentage of apoptotic cells showed a slight increase. Western blots confirmed the knockout of p53 proteins in L-02 hepatocytes after transfection of p53 shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). We further checked the pro-survival genes [B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), myeloid leukemia-1 (Mcl-1)] and S phase related proteins [cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), Cyclin E]. In the Scr cells, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were decreased in the Cr(VI) treatment groups, indicating the inhibition of cell proliferation. In p53 shRNA cells, the expressions of the pro-survival genes were increased, and not altered after Cr(VI) exposure, indicating that p53 could regulate pro-survival genes. The same results were observed for CDK2 and Cyclin E. The decreased expression of CDK2 and Cyclin E indicating the disturbance of S phase progression and p53 could regulate S phase related proteins to cause S phase arrest in senescent cells. We also checked the ROS levels in the above cultures. Cr(VI) induced ROS accumulation in both the Scr and p53 shRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cellular senescence is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest contributing to tissue aging and has been considered in recent years as an intrinsic barrier against tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In cell cultures, typically, cell cycle arrest lead to senescence but cell cycle arrest is not senescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Occupational exposure to Cr(VI) generally occurs by low-dose and long-term inhalation and dermal contact. SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity is the most extensively used biomarker for senescence because of the simplicity of the assay method and its specificity for senescent cells. Some thinks that the identification of senescence rests solely on the detection of SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity. In fact, it is reported that &#x003b2;-gal activity can be detected in cells in various non-senescent states such as extended incubation at high density, and there are conflicting reports regarding the presence of SA-&#x003b2;-gal activity in aged tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Thus, the suitability of SA-&#x003b2;-gal as a marker of senescence has been challenged<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In our present work we also examined other indicators of senescence including some biomarkers (such as Apo J, CTGF, and FN1), SASP and SAHF to confirm &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; senescence occurred. Apo J is an oxidative stress-responsive gene and is often up-regulated following the exposure of the senescence inducers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Apo J is not able to induce senescence, but rather a secondary consequence of the senescence phenotype. CTGF, a useful marker for the identification of senescence, is an age-associated protein that functioned by transforming growth factor- &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. FN expression can be markedly increased in senescent cells, which has been found correlates closely with the increasing size of senescent cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Cav-1, which related to the activation of p53/p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> and G0/G1 phase arrest in senescent cells, may function as a mediator in premature senescence to suppress tumor formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Most of previous researches associated with Cr(VI)-induced cytotoxicity were focused on apoptosis and the related mechanisms. In our previous published work we demonstrated that Cr(VI) targeted and inhibited MRCCs to induce ROS accumulation and then caused apoptosis. MRCC I and III showed significant decreased activities when the hepatocytes were treated with 20 or 40&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Cr(VI) for 12&#x02009;h<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, while MRCC I and II activities were inhibited when 4&#x02013;32&#x02009;&#x003bc;M Cr(VI) were used to treat the cells for 48&#x02009;h<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Our present study revealed that long-term and low-dosage exposure of Cr(VI) induced premature senescence by inhibiting MRCC I and II and then leading ROS accumulation. Although Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of MRCCs depend on Cr(VI) treatment time and concentration, we concluded that MRCC I was the one that most likely to be affected. NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is an inner mitochondrial membrane-bound multi-subunit enzyme complex. Complex I consists of at least 45 subunits of which 38 subunits are encoded by nuclear genome and 7 are encoded by the mitochondrial genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The present study focused on the subunit NDUFS3 because our preliminary data of gene chip result revealed that NDUFS3 was significantly down-regulated by Cr(VI) while there were no apparent change in other genes. It is known that mutations in NDUFS3 gene are associated with MRCC I deficiency, which is the most common enzymatic defect of the oxidative phosphorylation disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p><p>MDM2, which promotes p53 degradation by forming a stable complex through MDM2 and p53 N-terminal domains, is a negative regulator of p53<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. It has been confirmed that ATM phosphorylation of MDM2 is likely to be the key step in causing p53 stabilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Our current result revealed that ATM and MDM2 may associated with Cr(VI)-induced stabilization of p53 and we are still focusing on the related implied mechanisms. During the induction of senescence, p53 transactivates p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> gene, which is the only known mediator of its pro-senescent function, and p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> protein binds to and inhibits CDK2 and Cyclin E, which lead to S phase cell cycle arrest and senescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 are Bcl-2 family members, they are known as pro-survival genes that could indicate cell proliferative activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Bcl-2 promotor contains a p53-negative response element, which may account for p53-mediated transrepression of Bcl-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p><p>We knocked out p53 in L-02 hepatocytes to explore p53 function in premature senescence. Although we have confirmed that Cr(VI)-induced premature senescence in hepatocytes is depend on ROS-p53, we are surprised that other pathways were not involved in ROS-mediated premature senescence, as it has been reported that ROS can activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the activation of which can contribute to and be essential for certain types of senescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. It has also been suggested that ROS can activate p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) and extracelluar regulated protein kinase (ERK), which in turn activate Rb-p16<sup>INK4a</sup> pathway to induce senescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Surprisingly, we did not observe the involvement of Rb-p16<sup>INK4a</sup> pathway in Cr(VI)-induced premature senescence. A lot of questions remain to be answered, and we still have a long way to go to fully understand Cr(VI)-induced premature senescence.</p><p>Exposure to Cr(VI) has been known to be associated with induction of cancer in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Despite the adverse effect on physiological activities of cells, Cr(VI)-induced premature senescence can be also viewed as an intrinsic barrier against tumorigenesis. After exposed to Cr(VI), cells may become senescent, but a small subset of cells can bypass premature senescence to become survivors, that is why we should also focus on the &#x0201c;unaffected&#x0201d; cells. The survivors will either restore normal function or become pre-tumor cells with damaged DNA, and senescence bypass appears to be an important step in the development of cancer. Indeed, lots of findings raise the possibility that senescent cells create a special environment that inhibits cell proliferative activity, thereby functioning as tumor suppressive mechanism. It is still not clear after Cr(VI) exposure, how the senescent cells alter the surrounding microenvironment and what impact these alterations will have on tumorigenesis. Next we will focus on the correlation between Cr(VI)-induced senescence and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Zhang, Y. <italic>et al</italic>.
