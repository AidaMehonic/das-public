To investigate the pathogenic mechanism underlying this variant, we generated a knock-in mouse model of homozygous p.V37I by an embryonic stem cell gene targeting method. Auditory brainstem response test showed that the knock-in mice developed progressive, mild-to-moderate hearing loss over the first 4&#x02013;9 months. Overall no significant developmental and morphological abnormality was observed in the knock-in mouse cochlea, while confocal immunostaining and electron microscopic scanning revealed minor loss of the outer hair cells. Gene expression microarray analysis identified 105 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated genes in P5 knock-in mouse cochleae (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 adjusted by the Benjamini &#x00026; Hochberg method), among which four top candidate genes with the highest fold-changes or implication to deafness <italic>Fcer1g, Nnmt</italic> and <italic>Lars2</italic> and <italic>Cuedc1</italic> were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. Our study demonstrated that the homozygous p.V37I knock-in mouse modeled the hearing phenotype of the human patients and can serve as a useful animal model for further studies. The differentially expressed genes identified in this study may shed new insights into the understanding of the pathogenic mechanism and the phenotypic modification of homozygous p.V37I.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Hearing loss is the most common sensory disorder in humans, affecting approximately 2&#x02013;3% of children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

The hearing loss associated with DFNB1 was highly variable, ranging from birth to adulthood in age of onsets and from mild to profound in degree of severity. Based on the deleterious impact on the protein structure, most of the <italic>GJB2</italic> mutations can be categorized into truncating mutations (<italic>e.g.</italic> non-sense mutations, frameshifting indels, splicing site mutations) that often lead to null alleles of <italic>GJB2</italic> and non-truncating mutations (<italic>e.g.</italic> missense mutations, non-frameshifting indels) that only affecting single or multiple amino acids. Genotype-phenotype correlation studies showed that the degree of hearing loss associated with non-truncating mutations in <italic>GJB2</italic> was significantly less severe than that with truncating mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. One such example, the p.V37I variant in <italic>GJB2</italic>, is of our particular interest as it is prevalent in East and Southeast Asians, with allele frequencies of 0.062 in Chinese Hans, 0.043 in Thai, 0.01 in Japanese and 0.006 in Korean<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that Cx26 with truncating mutations cannot target to the cell membrane and has severely deteriorated gap junction activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. On the contrary, the p.V37I mutant Cx26 had normal cellular expression pattern at the plasma membrane and moderately impaired oligomerization and channel activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Consistently, the homozygous p.V37I variant of <italic>GJB2</italic> has been shown to be strongly associated with mild-to-moderate hearing loss.

So far, animal models of DFNB1 have only been established for conditional null alleles of <italic>Gjb2</italic>, which exhibits a rather early and severe hearing phenotype. Targeted ablation of <italic>Gjb2</italic> in mouse inner ear resulted in elevation of the hearing thresholds by 40&#x02013;50&#x02009;dB at postnatal day 21 (P21), stalled postnatal development of the organ of Corti as the tunnel of Corti and the Nuel&#x02019;s space were never opened, and massive cell death of the sensory epithelium in the middle and basal turns of cochlea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In this study, we aimed to generate a knock-in mouse model for the homozygous p.V37I variant in <italic>Gjb2</italic>, which may help to better understand why homozygous p.V37I is associated with milder degree of hearing loss than truncating mutations and what factors may contribute to the incomplete penetrance of homozygous p.V37I.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The homozygous p.V37I knock-in mice have progressive, mild-to-moderate hearing loss</title><p>Hearing thresholds of the homozygous p.V37I knock-in and wild-type mice were consecutively monitored at frequencies of 4, 8, 16, 24 and 36&#x02009;kHz between age 6 and 50 weeks by auditory brainstem response (ABR) tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).

Better understanding of the pathogenic mechanism and the genotype-phenotype correlation for this variant, therefore, may broadly facilitate clinical intervention and genetic counseling among the homozygous p.V37I carriers.</p><p>In this study, we generated a knock-in mouse model for the homozygous p.V37I variant in <italic>Gjb2</italic>. In comparison with the <italic>Gjb2</italic> knock-out mice, whose hearing thresholds were elevated by 40&#x02013;50&#x02009;dB at P21<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, the homozygous p.V37I knock-in mice had much milder degree of hearing loss with later onset and slower progression course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), which modeled its representative hearing phenotype in human patients. Consistent with the milder phenotype, the homozygous p.V37I knock-in mice have overall normal cochlear development and morphology and only minor outer hair cell loss at 50 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Though the minor loss of outer hair cells (&#x0003c;4%) is less likely to be solely responsible for the elevated hearing thresholds observed in the knock-in mice, it may reflect the underlying pathophysiological changes of the knock-in mice that were not apparent at the morphological level.</p><p>Though late-onset hearing loss was associated with homozygous p.V37I in both human patients and the mouse model, many p.V37I homozygous patients with late-onset hearing loss exhibited subclinical hearing loss (&#x0003c;35&#x02009;dB nHL at diagnosis but failed the initial otoacoustic emission hearing screening) at birth, implying that the pathophysiological process can be accumulative and begin in much earlier age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Consistently, deletion of Cx26 expression at P5 can also lead to late-onset hearing loss in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. To explore the early pathogenic pathway through which the homozygous p.V37I variant of <italic>Gjb2</italic> leads to eventual progressive hearing loss, we performed an inner ear gene expression microarray analysis for the P5 knock-in and wild-type mice. A total of 148 genes showed significant up-regulation (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;105) or down-regulation (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;43) in the knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), which provided a candidate list for genes potentially involved in the pathogenic process. The differential expression of four candidate genes, <italic>Fcer1g, Nnmt, Lars2</italic> and <italic>Cuedc1</italic>, was further confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). <italic>Fcer1g</italic>, <italic>Nnmt</italic> and <italic>Cuedc1</italic> were three top candidate genes with the highest fold changes in the microarray analysis. <italic>Fcer1g</italic> encodes the gamma chain of the high-affinity IgE receptor that is involved in allergic reactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. <italic>Nnmt</italic> encodes Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase that is involved in homocysteine synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. <italic>Cuedc1</italic> encodes a CUE domain protein with undefined function. Our literature search did not return any link between those three genes and the hearing function. <italic>Lars2,</italic> on the other hand, was an interesting candidate as mutations in this gene may lead to premature ovarian failure and hearing loss in Perrault syndrome (MIM 604544)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. <italic>Lars2</italic> encodes mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase. Mutations in many genes encoding this type of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, such as <italic>HARS2</italic>, <italic>KARS</italic>, <italic>NARS</italic> and <italic>LARS2</italic>, have been reported to be associated with non-syndromic or syndromic hearing loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, suggesting the importance of those genes in the inner ear function. We speculated that the decreased expression level of Lars2 triggered by the p.V37I homozygous variant of <italic>Gjb2</italic> may contribute to the hearing loss in the knock-in mice.</p><p>In summary, our study generated a homozygous p.V37I knock-in mouse model that modeled the representative hearing phenotype in human patients and provided a valuable tool for further functional studies of this variant. One intriguing question about the homozygous p.V37I variant in <italic>GJB2</italic> is to discover the factors that may contribute to its incomplete penetrance, which was estimated to be 17%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In future studies, it will be interesting to examine the impact of various environmental conditions, such as noise and aminoglycoside exposure, on the severity and onset of the hearing loss in the knock-in mice. On the other side, further genetic and molecular studies of the knock-in mice, like the in-depth analysis of the differentially expressed genes following the current study, may identify the genetic modifiers influencing the hearing phenotype.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Generation of the p.V37I knock-in mouse model</title><p>The p.V37I knock-in mouse model was generated by embryonic stem (ES) cell gene targeting as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.
