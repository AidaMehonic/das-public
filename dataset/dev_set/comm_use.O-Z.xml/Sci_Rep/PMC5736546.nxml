We succeeded in increasing the Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) stability and activity for formic acid oxidation (DFAFCs anodic reaction) by embedding them inside a chitosan matrix obtained from seafood wastes. Atop the commercial Pt/C, formic acid (FA) is predominantly oxidized via the undesired poisoning dehydration pathway (14 times higher than the desired dehydrogenation route), wherein FA is non-faradaically dissociated to CO resulting in deactivation of the majority of the Pt active-surface sites. Surprisingly, PtNPs chemical insertion inside a chitosan matrix enhanced their efficiency for FA oxidation significantly, as demonstrated by their 27 times higher stability along with ~400&#x02009;mV negative shift of the FA oxidation onset potential together with 270 times higher CO poisoning-tolerance compared to that of the commercial Pt/C. These substantial performance enhancements are believed to originate from the interaction of chitosan functionalities&#x000a0;(e.g., NH<sub>2</sub> and OH) with both PtNPs and FA molecules improving FA adsorption and preventing the PtNPs aggregation, besides providing the required oxygen helping with the oxidative removal of the adsorbed&#x000a0;poisoning CO-like species at low potentials.

Nevertheless, they still suffer from their insufficient long-term stability that obviously restricts their overall commercialization prospect. Unfortunately, this results from the fast deactivation of their commercial Pt-based catalysts with <italic>in-situ</italic> generated carbon monoxide (CO) intermediates from the &#x0201c;<italic>non-faradaic</italic>&#x0201d; dehydration of formic acid at the Pt surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, the development of an efficient and stable DFAFCs anode catalyst for formic acid electrooxidation (FAO) with a high CO poisoning tolerance is a key requirement for their commercialization and practical application.</p><p id="Par3">Extensive research efforts have been devoted to mitigate such poisoning effects (i.e., CO poisoning) to improve the Pt-based catalysts performance through several strategies. One of these approaches, is alloying platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) with non-precious metals/metal oxides to facilitate the oxidative removal of adsorbed CO at low potentials via providing required oxygen-containing functionalities (i.e., bifunctional mechanism). The ensemble effect is another strategy to mitigate CO poisoning via resisting the CO adsorption through distorting the structural proximity of the Pt surface active-sites required for CO adsorption/formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Another possible pathway is to modify the Pt surface electronic structure in such a way that it disfavors the CO adsorption through a so-called &#x0201c;electronic effect&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Another severe drawback of DFAFCs is the degradation of their commercial Pt- and Pd-based electrocatalysts resulting from the agglomeration (through diffusion and/or coalescence), sintering (via dissolution/re-deposition process) and corrosion of the support material (N.b., Pd and Pt nanoparticles facilitate the oxidation of the carbon support material), resulting in a permanent loss of DFAFCs performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Thus, the carbon support materials play a central role in improving the utilization and catalytic activity of the precious metal nanocatalysts. In this context, another efficient strategy to reduce the cost and to enhance the performance of the Pt-based catalysts, is anchoring the PtNPs on supporting materials that could not only provide large surface area, but also improve their performance (both activity and stability) through catalyst-support interactions. Several advanced carbon materials with high specific surface area, excellent physicochemical stability and electrical conductivity, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, are commonly used to anchor the Pt nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, despite these valuable efforts, the performance of the commercially-applied catalysts in DFAFCs remains insufficient and further improvement is required.</p><p id="Par5">Herein, PtNPs embedded in a nano-chitosan matrix are introduced as alternative efficient and stable anode catalyst for DFAFCs. Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide biopolymer obtained from the deacetylation of chitin, which is the second most abundant natural polysaccharide and the major component of crustacean shells (e.g., shrimps, crabs, etc)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We found that chitosan effectively reduces the average PtNPs size, improves the PtNPs dispersion, preventing the PtNPs sintering under the harsh electrochemical conditions through the strong interaction between the chitosan functionalities and PtNPs. It also facilitates the FAO charge transfer. Chitosan &#x02013;OH and &#x02013;NH<sub>2</sub> like functionalities are believed to provide anchoring sites for the Pt nanoparticles facilitating their dispersion and avoiding their aggregation (i.e., chitosan adsorbed on the PtNPs surface results in the formation of a shell that&#x000a0;stabilizes and protects the PtNPs). Besides, chitosan functional groups are believed to re-activate the poisoned PtNPs surface sites with the strongly adsorbed CO intermediates by capturing these adsorbed CO species from the PtNPs surface via a so-called &#x0201c;migration phenomenon&#x0201d;. Additionally, chitosan is believed to modify the PtNPs electronic structure in such a way that it disfavors the poisoning dehydration pathway and provides the required oxygen-containing groups needed for the oxidative removal of CO at low potentials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the electrochemical properties of the as-prepared nano-composite for DFAFCs applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par6">Chloroplatinic acid hydrate (&#x0003e;99.99%), sodium borohydride (~98%), formic acid (95&#x02013;97%), acetic acid glacial (&#x0003e;98.85%), chitosan (molecular weight 110,000&#x02013;150,000, purity &#x02265;93%), and sulfuric acid were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.

Chitosan-PtNPs nanocomposite catalysts exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity, catalytic stability together with a much better CO poisoning tolerance compared to that of the commercial Pt/C electrode. These outstanding enhancements are demonstrated by the exclusive oxidation of FA by the direct pathway (poisoning route completely diminished), significant negative shift of the FA oxidation onset potential (~400&#x02009;mV) along with 23 times higher catalytic stability compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Chitosan matrix (shell) is believed to protect the PtNPs from sintering and to increase their number of active surface sites. Besides, the chitosan functionalities are believed to retrieve the poisoned PtNPs sites with CO (produced from FA dehydration) via a so-called &#x0201c;<italic>spillover mechanism</italic>&#x0201d;, resulting in a significant increase in the catalysts CO-poisoning tolerance. Alternatively, the chitosan matrix is assumed to electronically interact with PtNPs in such a way that it weakens the CO-Pt binding and facilitates oxidative removal of the adsorbed CO at low potentials. This investigation presents a new way to improve the performance of the DFAFCs (e.g., activity and stability) even with using lower amounts of PtNPs (3 times lower) compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
