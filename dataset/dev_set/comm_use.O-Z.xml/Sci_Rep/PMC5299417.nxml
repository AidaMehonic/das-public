The anti-miRNA oligonucleotide (AMO-miR-100) was applied to inhibit the expression of miR-100. After AMO-miR-100 treatment, the shrimp was challenged with WSSV or <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>. The knockdown of miR-100 expression decreased the mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp from 24&#x02009;h to 72&#x02009;h post-infection and enhanced the mortality of <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>-infected shrimp significantly. The knockdown of miR-100 affected phenoloxidase (PO) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and total hemocyte count (THC) after the infection with WSSV or <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>, indicating a regulative role of miR-100 in the immune potential of shrimp in the response to WSSV or <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> infection. The knockdown of miR-100 induced the apoptosis of shrimp hemocytes, and <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;AMO-miR-100 treatment caused more hemocyte apoptosis than <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> treatment. The miR-100 influenced also the morphology of shrimp hemocytes and regulated the phagocytosis of WSSV or <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>. Thus, we concluded that miR-100 may promote the anti-<italic>Vibrio</italic> immune response of shrimp through regulating apoptosis, phagocytosis and PO activity and affects the progression of WSSV infection at a certain level.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function by base pairing with messenger RNAs and are involved in the regulation of almost every biological pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.

In an earlier investigation, the silencing of shrimp miR-100 expression caused an increase in the apoptotic activity of hemocytes and led to a further decrease in the number of viral genome copies in virus-infected shrimp<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Our previous study showed that miR-100 was over-expressed after <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus (V. alginolyticus</italic>) infection in shrimp<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.

WSSV is another lethal pathogen of Kuruma shrimps, and the infection caused by WSSV can lead to over 90% mortality in one week. In this study, we further explored the role of miR-100 in the innate immunity response of shrimp to WSSV or <italic>Vibrio</italic> infection.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>Identification <bold>of shrimp miRNAs response to WSSV or <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic></bold>infection. Our results indicated that the expression of a number of miRNAs was significantly up-regulated 24&#x02009;h after WSSV infection and down-regulated 24&#x02009;h following <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, the data showed that miR-100 expression was significantly up-regulated 24&#x02009;h after the infection with WSSV or <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>. Then northern blot analysis and Quantitative Stem-Loop real-time PCR were performed to validate the findings of the miRNA expression profiles obtained by microarray assay. The results confirmed that the miR-100 expression was indeed up-regulated 24&#x02009;h after the infection with WSSV or <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B,C</xref>).</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Loss of function of shrimp miR-100 by using anti-miRNA oligonucleotide</title><p>To further investigate the role of miR-100 in the innate immunity of shrimp, a loss-of-function analysis was performed by silencing of miR-100 expression with anti-miRNA oligonucleotide (AMO-miR-100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). The results showed that the miR-100 expression was inhibited by AMO-miR-100, and was influence by the AMO-miR-100-scramble at 24&#x02009;h but soon recovered at 36&#x02009;h, indicating the specificity of AMO-miR-100. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref> showed the inhibition effect at 36&#x02009;h.

We choose these immune-related genes for their known function. Target genes and pathways of miRNA-100 were predicted by TargetScan and miRanda algorithms. The target gene of miRNA-100 is importin subunit alpha-3 and the pathway is protein transporter activity. This result makes no mean to our research, because we want to investigate the function of miRNA-100 only. The data revealed that <italic>hemocyanin</italic> was significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) up-regulated by the inhibition of miR-100, whereas <italic>myosin</italic> was significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Effects of miR-100 knockdown on WSSV or <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> infection</title><p>miR-100 was knocked down by AMO-miR-100, followed by WSSV challenge, to evaluate the effect of miR-100 on WSSV infection. The data showed that the treatment with AMO-miR-100 significantly decreased the mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp individuals and prolonged their lifespan from 24&#x02009;h to 72&#x02009;h post-infection when compared to that the life duration of the shrimp only challenged with WSSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). This phenomenon indicates that the knockdown of miR-100 expression inhibits the infection with WSSV to a certain extent. To investigate the effects of miR-100 knockdown on the mortality of <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>-infected shrimp group, the shrimp group treated with AMO-miR-100 was challenged with <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>. The results revealed that the AMO-miR-100 treatment significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) elevated the mortality of <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>-infected shrimp when compared to that of the group with <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> challenge only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>).

It is noteworthy that no significant difference in PO activity was found between WSSV and WSSV&#x02009;+&#x02009;AMO-miR-100 groups in the first 24&#x02009;h. However, the PO activity of WSSV&#x02009;+&#x02009;AMO-miR-100 group was significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) lower than that of the WSSV group 36 and 48&#x02009;h post-treatment. This result showed that the knockdown of miR-100 weakened the PO activity after the WSSV infection, indicating that miR-100 can regulate the proPO system of shrimp in response to WSSV infection.</p><p>After the infection with <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>, the PO activity in the infected group was slightly higher than that in the PBS control, but no significant fluctuation was observed as infection time increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The PO activity of the <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;AMO-miR-100 group was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) than that of the <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> group at 12&#x02009;h post-treatment.

This result suggested that the knockdown of miR-100 affected PO activity after the infection with <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>, indicating a regulative role of miR-100 in the proPO system of shrimp in response to <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Influence of miR-100 knockdown on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity</title><p>After WSSV infection, the SOD activity of shrimp hemolymph was near 50% higher than control group at 12&#x02009;h, at 24&#x02009;h, the SOD activity dropped near 10% lower than PBS control group, and kept this trend to 48&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). As the expression of miR-100 was inhibited, the SOD enzyme was not as active as WSSV infected group, significantly lower than WSSV group or PBS group at 24&#x02009;h, 36&#x02009;h, then slowly recovered at 48&#x02009;h. After <italic>Vibrio. alginolyticus</italic> infection, the SOD activity of shrimp hemolymph dropped below control at 12&#x02009;h, then raise over 1.5 times higher than PBS group 24&#x02013;36&#x02009;h, declined again at 48&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The SOD activity of shrimp hemolymph increased at 12&#x02009;h, then as the knock-down effect of AMO-miR-100 started to work, at 36&#x02013;48&#x02009;h, the SOD activity smoothly increased, and showed a relatively lower SOD activity than that of <italic>Vibrio</italic> infected group. SOD activity of shrimp hemolymph was enhanced immediately after WSSV infection, but faded after 24&#x02009;h, indicating the decrease of shrimp immunity. Inhibition of miR-100 weakened the SOD activity of shrimp hemolymph post WSSV infection immediately, indicating that the shrimp immunity was decreasing without miR-100. Meanwhile, after the Vibrio infection the SOD activity kept increasing in 12&#x02013;36&#x02009;h. In the lack of miR-100, the increase of SOD activity slowed down and was relatively lower at late stage. This result implied a positive role of miR-100 in shrimp immunity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Influence of miR-100 knockdown on total hemocyte count post infection</title><p>WSSV infection caused a decrease of shrimp THC in 12&#x02013;24&#x02009;h, raise a little at 36&#x02009;h and dropped below control at 48&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). The inhibition of miR-100 leads to a higher THC, at 36&#x02013;48&#x02009;h, the THC number was significantly higher than WSSV only group. Meanwhile, after <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> infection, the THC was higher than control at 12&#x02009;h, decreased at 24&#x02009;h, at 36&#x02009;h, the THC raised significantly beyond the control group and reach a maximum value, decreased again to an even number as control. After the expression of miR-100 was inhibited, the THC increased at 12&#x02009;h compared to Vibrio only group, at 24&#x02013;48&#x02009;h, the THC decreased. Both WSSV and Vibrio could trigger the self-destruction process of apoptosis or phagocytosis to eliminate pathogen. The increasing of THC after miR-100 inhibition suggesting a negative role of miR-100 in anti-virus process. On the contrary, the decrease of THC suggesting a positive role of miR-100 in anti-bacteria process.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Influence of miR-100 knockdown on early-stage and late-stage apoptosis</title><p>Apoptosis assay of shrimp hemocytes with/without miR-100 knockdown was performed with detection by flow cytometry (FCM). In the PBS treatment, the percentage of Annexin V-positive hemocytes was 29.0% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>), which was slightly higher than the normal value of the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>) in a stabilized cell line of insect cells. We adjusted the pH of the EDTA anticoagulant, the PI dose, and the centrifugation parameters. Further, we minimized the progress time to avoid mechanical damage and reduce the early-stage apoptosis during the staining process. The vulnerability of shrimp hemocytes leads to the high extent of early-stage apoptosis and mechanical damage. Maximal efforts were exerted to minimize the damage and ensure the reliability of our results. The apoptosis of shrimp hemocytes increased substantially after their treatment with AMO-miR-100 for 36&#x02009;h, showing that the knockdown of miR-100 would increase the apoptosis rate of shrimp hemocytes. Moreover, the apoptosis percentage of shrimp hemocytes treated with AMO-miR-100 was nearly two-fold higher than that of PBS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7G</xref>), indicating that the lack of miR-100 can induce apoptosis in shrimp hemocytes. These findings suggest an essential role of miR-100 and the considerable influence of its negative regulation on the apoptosis of shrimp hemocytes. The apoptosis percentage of WSSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7C,H</xref>) treatment was slightly higher (no significant difference) than WSSV&#x02009;+&#x02009;AMO-miR-100 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7D,H</xref>), while the apoptosis percentage of the <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> treatment was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) than that of the <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;AMO-miR-100 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7E,F and H</xref>). This result indicated that the negative regulation of miR-100 on apoptosis was more effective in <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>-infected shrimp than in WSSV-infected shrimp.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Influence of miR-100 knockdown on cell morphology and phagocytosis</title><p>To observe the cell morphology of hemocytes, they were stained and analyzed under a confocal microscope, and then the phagocytosis was detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that, in comparison with the control group, the cell extension of AMO-miR-100-treated hemocytes was not good as that of the control, and the cell morphology was abnormal, especially concerning the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). Therefore, miR100 influenced the stability of cell skeleton to a certain extent. In addition, the phagocytosis rate (16.1%) in WSSV&#x02009;+&#x02009;AMO-miR100 was slightly higher than that of the WSSV group (12.6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). After the treatment with AMO-miR-100, the phagocytosis rate in the <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;AMO-miR-100 treatment (18.1%) was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) than that in the <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> group (9.5%). These data suggest that the knockdown of miR-100 would lead to more pronounced <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> engulfing by phagocytes. This result indicates that miR-100 may negatively regulate the phagocytosis progress.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs participate in almost every step of cellular processes and are often aberrantly expressed in human cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.

Through small RNA sequencing, miR-100 was found to be over-expressed after infection with <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Hence, our study contributes to elucidating the role of miR-100 in shrimp immune response to WSSV and <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> infections.</p><p>In loss function experiment, we found there were two genes, among multiple major immune related genes, were influenced by the knock-down of miR-100. Hemocyanin, and Myosin. Previous research has shown that hemocyanin is an important respiratory protein which transports oxygen throughout the bodies of shrimps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and might be involved in their resistance to pathogenic infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The data obtained in this study indicated that hemocyanin expression was regulated by miR-100. Myosin is a cytoskeleton protein which regulates multiple processes, such as material transport, muscle contraction, cell division and phagocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. However, myosin is mostly known for its essential role in muscle construction and motility processes. In a previous study, the light chain of myosin was extracted from shrimp<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The findings of the investigation confirmed that shrimp myosin responded to virus invasion and was involved in the regulation of hemocytic phagocytosis. The roles of phagocytes and phagocytosis were crucial in the response of the innate immune system, and the down-regulation of myosin under AMO-miR-100 treatment suggested a potential influence of miR-100 on phagocytosis.</p><p>Recently, many studies have confirmed that miR-100 can regulate multiple genes to induce the cell apoptosis in many types of mammalian cell lines. There is a growing body of evidence that miR-100 inhibits the progression of apoptosis in human cancer cells through multiple pathways. Shrimp miR-100 was found to be an inhibitor in the apoptosis process of shrimp hemocytes in previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Our research presented a similar conclusion, in contrast to the mechanism for control of apoptosis in human tumor cells, miR-100 negatively regulates the process of apoptosis in shrimp hemocytes. Our results revealed that WSSV infection would inhibit this negative regulation but <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> infection would not.</p><p>To explore other effect of miR-100 on shrimp innate immunity, several functional parameters for evaluating the immune potential have been detected. In WSSV-infected shrimps, as the miR-100 expression was inhibited, the PO activity and SOD activity was significantly decreased. In <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> infected shrimps, the PO activity was slightly increased at early stage, and SOD activity was relatively lower and showed a less activity increasing trend. The less effective function of PO and SOD implying a positive role of miR-100 in the anti-virus and anti-<italic>Vibrio</italic> respond. The THC post WSSV infection increased under miR-100 knock-down, while the THC post <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> infection decreased. The same results were obtained in the apoptosis analyze. The mortality of <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>-infected shrimps was also elevated. Meanwhile, the knockdown of miR-100 resulted in an increase in the phagocytosis rates of both WSSV-infected and <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>-infected shrimps. This result indicated that miR-100 also inhibited the phagocytosis ability of shrimp hemocytes.</p><p>Synthesized into a conclusion, these findings indicate that shrimp miR-100 plays an essential role in the innate immune system of shrimp. miR-100 promotes the anti-<italic>Vibrio</italic> immune response of shrimp through regulating THC, apoptosis, phagocytosis, and PO activity.
