Furthermore, low HDR rates (between 1&#x02013;20%) can be enhanced two- to ten-fold in both iPSCs and HEK293 cells by &#x02018;cold shocking&#x02019; cells at 32&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x02013;48&#x02009;hours following transfection. This method can also increases the proportion of loci that have undergone complete sequence conversion across the donor sequence, or &#x02018;perfect HDR&#x02019;, as opposed to partial sequence conversion where nucleotides more distal to the CRISPR cut site are less efficiently incorporated (&#x02018;partial HDR&#x02019;). We demonstrate that the structure of the single-stranded DNA oligo donor can influence the fidelity of HDR, with oligos symmetric with respect to the CRISPR cleavage site and complementary to the target strand being more efficient at directing &#x02018;perfect HDR&#x02019; compared to asymmetric non-target strand complementary oligos. Our protocol represents an efficient method for making CRISPR-mediated, specific DNA sequence changes within the genome that will facilitate the rapid generation of genetic models of human disease in iPSCs as well as other genome engineered cell lines.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">One of the most promising applications of the Clustered Regularly Spaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technology is its use in creating genetic models of human disease. CRISPR technology can be used on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) isolated from normal individuals to study a disease phenotype, or on IPSCs derived from disease patients to revert putative disease-causing mutations back to wild type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The relative robustness of the CRISPR approach compared to zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) has made testing accessible on protein coding mutations as well as empirical data generated by genome-wide association studies and other non-coding mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Despite numerous successes, gene editing in iPSCs is challenged by the fact that homology directed repair (HDR), the process by which exogenous donor DNA is used to repair CRISPR-induced double strand breaks, is less efficient in iPSCs than transformed cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">To overcome low HDR rates, researchers have adopted several strategies such as including antibiotic resistance genes on the CRISPR plasmid and/or donor DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> which, while effective, leaves an undesired insertion of foreign DNA into the genome. Combining positive selection markers with technologies that allow for excision of the selectable marker, such as the Cre/lox system or the footprint-free PiggyBAC transposon, represent notable improvements but extend timelines as clonal selection becomes a two-step process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Methods that employ single-stranded oligo DNA nucleotide (ssODN) donor molecules avoid the issues that larger, double-stranded DNA molecules present with respect to random integration and unwanted &#x02018;footprints&#x02019;, but again are subject to the relatively low frequency of successful repair and sequence conversion around the site of the double-stranded break<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. To contend with the difficulty of isolating rare clones, Miyaoka and colleagues devised a strategy using droplet digital PCR, pools of clones, and sib selection to enrich for extremely rare clones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Additional strategies to increase the rate of HDR include timing the delivery of the Cas9 RNP complex to the nuclease by inducing cell cycle synchronization with known chemical inhibitors of cell cycle progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Here, while notable increases in HDR, up to 38%, can be achieved with synchronized HEK293 cells, synchronization had minimal effect in human primary fibroblasts or H9 human embryonic stem cells. Specifics of the ssODN structure and composition have also been shown to affect HDR rates. Lin <italic>et al</italic>. found that oligos with homology arms of at least 60 nucleotides were most effective, but that strand complementarity was not a factor. A more detailed investigation into how the structure of donor oligos affects HDR in HEK293 cells by Richardson <italic>et al</italic>. used insights gained from <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies of Cas9 RNP-dsDNA complex. Using a GFP-reporter assay, they demonstrated that asymmetric donor oligos that are shorter with respect to the PAM site and are complementary to the (+) strand (i.e. non-target strand) were more effective in promoting HDR than symmetric donor oligos. A study optimizing HDR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> in iPSCs by Paquet <italic>et al</italic>. showed that efficient insertion of an intended mutation could be achieved with oligos that where complementary to the target strand (&#x02212;) and that the frequency of the intended mutation integration was distance-dependent from the CRISPR cut site. Fidelity of HDR could also be increased by the introduction of silent base changes into the oligo that disrupted the CRISPR recognition sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">We have carried out a systematic evaluation of the gene-editing steps in iPSCs to determine the best combination of delivery, CRISPR modality, and donor oligo design. We then tested the effects of a moderate &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; on the cells&#x02019; ability to carry out HDR. Our optimized method can successfully introduce desired genetic alterations into the genome with 10&#x02013;30% efficiency through our novel combination of lipids designed for large RNA molecule delivery in conjunction with Cas9-encoding mRNA, symmetric donor oligos complementary to the target strand (&#x02212;), and silent changes to prevent re-editing. Additional exposure of cells to a brief &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; of 32&#x02009;&#x000b0;C can increase the amount of perfect HDR as much as two- to ten-fold in instances where low efficiency repair is observed at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Efficient HDR in iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 RNA modality and lipid delivery</title><p id="Par5">We evaluated several aspects of gene editing protocols in order to find the best conditions for generating HDR within the CAMK2D gene. First, we determined which CRISPR modalities [e.g. all-in-one plasmid DNA, sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA, or sgRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (IVT)/Cas9 ribronucleoprotein] and delivery methods (e.g. nucleofection or lipids formulated for enhanced delivery of large DNA and RNA molecules) generated the greatest the number of double-stranded breaks at two specific locations within the CAMK2D gene (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) as detected by PCR amplicon next-generation sequencing (NGS). The best NHEJ-induced indel rate for each modality and delivery method are presented in the supplementary data (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). the complete matrix of conditions used to determine optimal indel formation were then re-tested to determine the best combination of modality and delivery to promote HDR. We used a multiplexed ddPCR assay to measure the incorporation of four base changes designed to disrupt the CRISPR recognition sequence and, by proxy, the incorporation of the specific mutations designed to create a kinase-dead version of CAMK2D on the same oligo (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The amount of wild type unedited sequence was determined using a different probe that specifically detected the non-HDR wild type alleles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The donor oligo design was symmetric with respect to the lengths of the homology arms and the CRISPR cleavage sites were located as close as possible to the intended kinase dead mutations. The donor sequence was also homologous to the non-targeting CRISPR cut strand (+). The four silent mutations introduced by the oligo altered the CRISPR recognition sequence for guide CAMK-CR2 in four positions and in guide CAMK-CR1, mutated the PAM sequence and introduced 3 sequence changes. The assay was validated using both synthesized fragments of the different DNA sequences, and on clones previously made in HEK293 cells known to be heterozygous and homozygous for the HDR donor oligo sequence (data not shown).

To confirm the ddPCR results, we performed NGS on PCR amplicons from the transfected populations of iPSCs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). For IVT sgRNA/Cas9 mRNA with both CAMK-CR1 and CAMK-CR2, the intended base changes that would indicate successful HDR into the locus were observed at their precise genomic coordinates and at frequencies that closely matched those determined by ddPCR, including the two guanine substitutions that were not directly measured by the ddPCR assay. These two substitutions, which are more distal to the CRISPR cut sites than the silent changes designed to disrupt sgRNA annealing, were observed at lower frequencies.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssODN) donor design, droplet digital PCR probes and primer designs for gene editing and mutation detection at CAMK2D locus.

(<bold>b</bold>) Two ssODN HDR donors (C-CR2 and C-CR2-Asym) were designed to introduce a kinase dead K43R mutation (AAA to AGG) and four silent mutations into Exon2 of the CAMK2D locus. The ssODN donor C-CR2 is a (+) strand HDR donor which is complementary to the guide RNA targeted cleavage strand with balanced homology arms around each side of the intended mutations (5&#x02032;-73nt and 3&#x02032;-72nt, respectively). C-CR2-Asym is a (&#x02212;) strand HDR donor which is complementary to the guide RNA non-targeted strand with homology arms that differ in length (5&#x02032;-93nt and 3&#x02032;-36nt, respectively). To prevent subsequent re-cleavage, both donor oligo C-CR2 and C-CR2-Asym introduces three silent mutations within the guide CAMK-CR1 recognition site and one silent mutation within the PAM site. C-CR2 and C-CR2-Asym introduces four silent mutations within the guide CAMK-CR2 recognition site. A pair of primers and allele-specific probes conjugated with Vic or Fam fluorophores were also designed to detect separately the unaltered wild type alleles and mutated sequence conversion events.

The amount of total HDR across all temperature conditions and oligo concentrations were also comparable for guide CAMK-CR1. In general, statistically significant increases in total HDR were observed across all comparisons of temperature, guide and oligo design. For guide CAMK-CR1 the amount of total HDR for both oligos, across the three temperature conditions was essentially the same and where an approximately 2.9 fold increase in total HDR was observed under the PL3 temperature condition for both oligo designs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). For CAMK-CR2, the fold increase in total HDR for the symmetrical oligo, C-CR2 was approximately 2.4 fold but the magnitude of the response was greater than that observed for guide CAMK-CR1, where 40% of the alleles had undergone some type of HDR. For the asymmetric design, C-CR2-Asym, a total increase of HDR of 3.5 fold was observed between PL1 and PL3 however the magnitude of the response was approximately half of that observed with the symmetrical guide (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). However when only considering the amount of &#x02018;perfect&#x02019; HDR observed as a result of &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019;, the type of oligo used had a dramatic effect especially for guide CAMK-CR2 where the differential in total HDR was higher between the two designs to begin with and where symmetrical oligo design was superior in directing conversion of all six nucleotide changes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). For guide CAMK-CR1, where the amount of total HDR was similar for both oligo types across all temperature conditions, the amount of &#x02018;perfect&#x02019; HDR was again greater for the symmetrical oligo however the difference was only statistically significant under the PL3 conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

Amplicon based NGS and analysis confirmed that &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; produced statistically significant increase in total HDR for both guides with the exception of the PL1 vs PL3 comparison for guide CAMK-CR2. In general, increases in &#x02018;perfect HDR&#x02019; exceeded 10 fold for both guides and all conditions (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">The amount of NHEJ-associated indel formation with each temperature condition and treatment is presented in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>. &#x02018;Cold shock&#x02019; produced an approximately 2.4 fold increase in NHEJ in the 24&#x02009;hour condition (PL2) and a 2 fold increase in the 48&#x02009;hour condition (PL3) for guide CAMK2D-CR1 and a 5.5 fold and 4 fold increase for guide CAMK2D-CR2 under the same conditions.

Here we report an optimized CRISPR modality/delivery combination that is highly effective in promoting HDR in the mc-iPSC line. We then used this method to evaluate if exposure to lower temperature can increase the efficiency of HDR and found that exposure 32&#x02009;&#x000b0;C or &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; for 24 or 48&#x02009;hours is capable of increasing rates of HDR 2 fold or more. Given that appreciable effort is being exerted to find ways of increasing rates of HDR, including &#x02018;driving&#x02019; the repair process away from non-homologous end joining toward HDR with chemical inhibition of DNA repair enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and blocking and synchronizing cells at the G2/M boundary with other inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, our method provides a more &#x02018;physiological&#x02019; approach that might have broader application, especially where gene editing is being applied in a therapeutic setting. Interestingly, the &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; effect is more dramatic when lower HDR rates are observed (1&#x02013;20% of the alleles) and diminishes as the base HDR rate increases above 30% or more. In fact, the largest increase in total HDR fold change was in with HEK293 cells where the baseline HDR at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C was in the 1% range. The diminishing of the &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; response at high baseline HDR suggests a theoretical limit to the number of alleles that can be altered, at least with this approach. The exact mechanism by which the &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; increases HDR is currently under investigation. A mechanism similar to how zinc finger nucleases increase indel formation may be plausible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We observe that with very efficient CRISPRs the effect of the &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; on indel formation is minimal, as observed with CAMK2D guide CAMK-CR1 and TGFBR1 guide TR-CR2. Conversely, when cutting efficiencies and indel formation are lower, as that observed at the CAMK2D locus in HEK293 cells, the increases in cutting efficiency and indel formation are more pronounced. Increased indel formation can clearly contribute to higher HDR rates but does not account for all the increase observed with &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; or explain why &#x02018;perfect HDR&#x02019; can be favored under cold conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). A possible mechanism that may contribute to increased HDR rates is that growing cells at 32&#x02009;&#x000b0;C impacts the cell cycle, with more cells accumulating in G2/M; however, our initial observations to date do not show any cell cycle effects to support this hypothesis (data not shown). A third and more likely contributing factor is that the cold has a thermodynamic effect that acts to stabilize recombination intermediates. Work is currently ongoing to understand the mechanism in detail. One potential concern is that the &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; might adversely affect pluripotency. Preliminary analysis looking at three standard markers of pluripotency, Oct4, SSEA3, and Nanog<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> suggest this is not an issue, although some loss of Nanog expression may occur with prolonged exposure to cold (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Clearly more work is needed to ensure that &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; is effective and generalizable across cell lines and applications.</p><p id="Par15">Clearly, another important component and consideration for obtaining efficient HDR is the structure of ssODN. Although many potential designs can be envisioned, we have tested what many considered to be the standard design, symmetrical length homology arms with strand complementary to the target strand to an alternative design that employs asymmetric homology arms, with the short arm being proximal to the CRISPR cut site and strand complementary to the non-targeted strand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Across the two loci tested, both oligo designs were fairly equivalent in their ability to promote total HDR to high levels when used in combination with efficient guides and an efficient and optimized lipid delivery system. Both oligo designs also responded to &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; with increases in total HDR in a nearly equivalent fashion, although the symmetrical design tended to work better. Where the oligo designs differentiated themselves was in how they could promote HDR over a greater distance from the CRISPR cut site to promote sequence alterations, or &#x02018;perfect HDR&#x02019;. This difference was significant at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C but more importantly the increase in &#x02018;perfect&#x02019; HDR can represent the majority of the increase in HDR as the result of &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019;(Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>). These data suggest that if the desired genomic sequence alteration or multiple changes are required across the length of the donor oligonucleotide, that symmetrical targeted strand oligos, in conjunction with &#x02018;cold shock&#x02019; might represent the preferred approach.

Quality filtering was performed on paired-end reads using PRINSEQ. Reads with quality score mean below 30 or length shorter than 50 were removed. The remaining reads were then aligned to a reference genome with BWA, followed by realignment using ABRA (Assembly-Based ReAligner) to enhance detection of large indels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We examined the read coverage for each amplicon, and surveyed the whole amplicon region for insertion and deletion frequencies. To assess CRISPR efficiency, we defined a simple measurement, % indel reads, which represents the percentage of reads that have CRISPR-induced indels among all reads that span the window of sgRNA sequence (about 20 bases without PAM). For a read to be considered an indel read, it must have at least one inserted or deleted base inside this window, whereas a wild-type read must have no indels within the window. To evaluate homology-directed repair (HDR) effectiveness, we examined point mutation frequencies in the window and its flanking regions, and categorized the sequences into four groups: (1) &#x02018;Perfect HDR&#x02019;: the repair has all intended base changes with no indels between them; (2) Edited HDR: some or all intended base changes occur, but indels are present, likely due to re-editing by CRISPR after the directed repair; (3) Partial HDR: some but not all intended base changes occur, with no indels within the repaired sequence. This could be caused by partial repair or fragmentation of DNA strand during the NGS procedure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>ddPCR assay to detect CAMK2D wild type and mutation sequences</title><p id="Par23">The QX200<sup>TM</sup> Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad laboratories, CA) was used as suggested by the manufacturer. ddPCR assays for detecting CAMK2D wild-type and mutated sequences were designed using Primer Express and ordered from Life Technologies (Life Technologies, CA, USA). ddPCR reactions were assembled using standard protocols: ddPCR Super mix for Probes (no dUTP) (Bio-Rad laboratories, CA, USA) was combined with 160ng of sample genomic DNA, 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of 20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;FAM assay and 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of 20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;VIC assay (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;CAMK2D-ddPCR primer F &#x00026; CAMK2D-ddPCR primer R at 900&#x02009;nM each, 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;probes at 250&#x02009;nM each), 5 units of restriction enzyme BamHI &#x02013;HF&#x000ae; (New England BioLabs, MA), and water for a final reaction volume of 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;l.
