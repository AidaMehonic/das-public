Under harsh autumn conditions, they shut down reproduction, increase body weight and hibernate, while during spring they become sexually active even under negative energy-balance. We recently reported that these rhythms are associated with synchronized changes in genes expressing reproductive (<italic>Kiss1</italic>, <italic>Rfrp</italic>) and metabolic (<italic>Npy</italic> and <italic>Pomc</italic>) peptides, raising the hypothesis of coordinated seasonal regulation of both functions. Here we analyzed whether kisspeptin and RFRP-3 regulate food-intake in parallel to their established reproductive functions. Intracerebroventricular administration of kisspeptin inhibited food intake by 1.5-fold in fasted, but not <italic>ad-libitum</italic> fed, female jerboas captured in spring, an effect associated with an increase in <italic>Pomc</italic> and decrease in <italic>Rfrp</italic> mRNA levels. By contrast, intracerebroventricular injection of RFRP-3 induced a 4-fold increase in food-intake in <italic>ad-libitum</italic> female jerboas, together with a decrease in <italic>Pomc</italic> and increase in <italic>Npy</italic> mRNA levels. This orexigenic effect of RFRP-3 was observed in both spring and autumn, whereas kisspeptin&#x02019;s anorexigenic effect was only observed in spring. Altogether, this study reports opposite metabolic effects of kisspeptin and RFRP-3 in the female jerboa and strengthens our hypothesis of a coordinated, season-dependent, regulation of reproductive activity and food intake through interactions of these hypothalamic peptides.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>An increasing number of studies support that the regulation of reproduction is intimately linked to energy homeostasis, especially in wild species exposed to marked seasonal changes in environmental light, temperature and food availability. Major progress has been made recently in the understanding of central mechanisms governing reproductive activity with the finding that two hypothalamic peptides, kisspeptin (Kp) and RF amide-related peptide 3 (RFRP-3, also known as gonadotropin inhibitory hormone) regulate GnRH neuronal activity and gonadotropin secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In this study, we examine whether these two reproductive neuropeptides alter metabolism by investigating their effect on food intake and the metabolic neuropeptides proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in a wild hibernating seasonal rodent captured from its natural biotope, the jerboa (<italic>Jaculus orientalis</italic>).</p><p>Kp and RFRP-3, expressed in neurons localized either in the arcuate (ARC) and anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) nuclei or the medial hypothalamus, respectively, are now recognized to play pivotal roles in the central control of reproduction.

RFRP-3 increases food intake in rodents, sheep and non-human primates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> while Kp displays an anorexigenic effect in overnight fasted mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In line with these feeding behaviors, other studies indicate that both peptides may regulate POMC or NPY arcuate neurons. POMC is an anorexigenic precursor polypeptide that inhibits food intake, a process mainly mediated by &#x003b1;-MSH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. NPY on the other hand displays a strong orexigenic effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In sheep, Kp fibers are in close apposition to POMC and NPY neurons and Kp treatment decreases POMC and increases NPY gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, while in mice, Kp activates POMC and inhibits NPY neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. On the other hand, RFRP-3 projects to NPY and POMC neurons in the ewe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, attenuates the action of Kp on POMC neurons in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and increases NPY gene expression in the rat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>We recently reported a unique coordinated springtime activation of genes encoding peptides involved in reproduction (<italic>Kiss1</italic> and <italic>Rfrp</italic>) and metabolism (<italic>POMC</italic> and <italic>somatostatin</italic>) in the wild jerboa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The jerboa is a particularly interesting animal model living in a semi-desert milieu characterized by large annual variations in environmental temperature, water and food supply. In autumn/winter, when the natural conditions are unfavorable, jerboas shut down their reproductive activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, increase their food intake and body weight and hibernate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, while in spring/summer when favorable conditions return, the animals display opposite regulations with a reactivation of reproduction and reduction in body weight and food intake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p><p>Altogether, these observations suggest that the jerboa&#x02019;s reproduction and energy homeostasis may be strictly coordinated in order to ensure optimal synchronization between reproduction and offspring survival in a marked seasonal environment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether the reproductive neuropeptides Kp and RFRP-3 regulate food intake and metabolic neuropeptides, taking into account putative sex differences and seasonal effects.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Effect of central injection of Kp10 on food intake and hypothalamic peptide gene expression in fasted female and male jerboa in spring or autumn</title><p>Although a single dose of 4&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Kp10 was enough to increase by 5 fold the circulating testosterone in male jerboas (see material and methods section), the peptide displayed no effect on food intake when compared to control <italic>ad-libitum</italic> fed male and female jerboas (data not shown). Based on published data where Kp10 inhibited food intake in fasted mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, the effect of the peptide was next evaluated on 48&#x02009;h fasted jerboas captured in spring or autumn. Kp10 strongly decreased food intake in fasted female jerboas captured in spring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>) with a significant reduction of food intake as early as 1&#x02009;hour post-injection (&#x02212;50%, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 compared with vehicle treated animals). In the next 1&#x02009;h to 5&#x02009;h post-injection, food intake was inhibited but during the following nocturnal phase, equal values of cumulative food intake were observed 24&#x02009;h after either peptide or vehicle injections, indicating a late compensatory increase of food intake in the Kp10-treated group. The same dose of Kp10 failed to alter food intake from 1&#x02009;h up to 24&#x02009;h post-injection in fasted sexually quiescent females captured in autumn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This experiment was repeated once the following year with similar results, confirming a seasonally-dependent anorexigenic effect of Kp10 on food intake in fasted female jerboas. In fasted male jerboas, captured in either spring or autumn, central administration of Kp10 had no significant effect on food intake from 1&#x02009;h to 24&#x02009;h post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>To reveal central sites where Kp10 could act to regulate the female jerboa&#x02019;s food intake, the level of expression of genes encoding hypothalamic peptides involved in the regulation of food intake was measured 1&#x02009;h30 post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Kp10 injection displayed no effect on the ARC <italic>Npy</italic> mRNA expression in both spring and autumn (P&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). On the other hand, Kp10 injection markedly increased the number of ARC <italic>Pomc</italic> expressing neurons 1&#x02009;h30 after injection in females in both spring (+57%, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and autumn (+40%, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). A two-way ANOVA analysis further revealed a significant season-dependent effect of Kp10 on the number of <italic>Pomc</italic> expressing neurons with a stronger effect in spring than in autumn (F&#x02009;=&#x02009;41.883; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Furthermore, Kp10 injection induced a season-dependent effect on <italic>Rfrp</italic> gene expression with a decrease in the number of <italic>Rfrp</italic> mRNA expressing neurons at spring (+34% (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01)) and no significant effect in autumn (P&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). Although female jerboas were fasted for 48&#x02009;h, it is interesting to note that the number of <italic>Pomc</italic> and <italic>Rfrp</italic> expressing neurons was higher in spring than in autumn in vehicle-injected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 for <italic>Pomc</italic>, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for <italic>Rfrp</italic>).

This orexigenic effect of RFRP-3 was strong and significant as early as 1&#x02009;h post-injection (+395% and +236% for spring and autumn, respectively, in the RFRP-3 treated group as compared to vehicle; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and lasted up to 24&#x02009;hours post-injection (+25%, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, and +21%, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, in RFRP-3 compared to vehicle treated animals in spring and autumn respectively). The two-way RM ANOVA revealed a significant effect of treatment (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003 for spring and P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002 for autumn) and time (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for both seasons), with no dependence of treatment on time. This experiment was repeated once the following year and similar results were obtained, confirming the potent orexigenic effect of RFRP-3 in the female jerboa.</p><p>To evaluate the hypothalamic sites of action of RFRP-3, the level of <italic>Npy</italic> and <italic>Pomc</italic> mRNA was measured 1h30 after the injection of peptide or vehicle in spring and autumn female jerboas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C,D</xref>).

Notably, in agreement with the previous experiment, the number of <italic>Pomc</italic> expressing neurons is higher in spring as compared to autumn whether jerboas were treated with vehicle or peptide (F&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.56, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study reports that in addition to regulating the reproductive activity, the hypothalamic RF-amide peptides, Kp and RFRP-3, exhibit differential metabolic effects in jerboas. RFRP-3 induces a strong season-independent orexigenic effect in <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed female jerboas while Kp displays a season-dependent anorexigenic effect in female jerboas under negative metabolic state. Furthermore, our data indicate that both peptides may exert their actions via a specific regulation of hypothalamic peptides known to regulate food intake, particularly POMC and NPY.</p><p>Recent evidence has pointed the sensitivity of the kisspeptinergic system to negative energy balance states as a decline in the hypothalamic <italic>Kiss1</italic> expression has been reported under conditions of metabolic stress or food restriction in rats and mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Our data show that Kp10 also exerts a rapid and profound anorexinergic effect in female jerboas challenged with 48&#x02009;h food deprivation. This anorexigenic effect of Kp10 however was observed only in females captured in spring, but not autumn, and was not found when jerboas were fed <italic>ad-libitum</italic>. Of note, when jerboas were food restricted for a shorter time (24&#x02009;h), Kp10 was still unable to alter food intake (data not shown) probably because these wild semi-desertic rodents are resistant to food deprivation for up to 5 days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In line with these observations, earlier works have reported that Kp10 did not alter food intake in <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed or 12&#x02009;h-fasted male rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> or sheep<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> while a recent study showed that Kp10 reduced food intake in overnight fasted, but not <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed, mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. When Kp10 was injected in male jerboas, whether <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed or fasted, the food intake was similar to vehicle treated animals. Such a sexual dimorphism regarding Kp regulation of metabolism was recently reported in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. In this study, female KO for the Kp receptor encoding gene (<italic>Kiss1r</italic>) displayed higher body weight and circulating leptin, and impaired glucose tolerance along with lower food intake and energy expenditure, as compared to wild type littermates, while male <italic>Kiss1r</italic> KO mice preserved normal body weight and glucose regulation. Altogether these data support the idea that Kp is anorexigenic under negative energy balance, and in the jerboa this effect appears to be sex- and season-dependent.</p><p>In order to further investigate the hypothalamic sites underlying the anorexigenic effect of Kp10 in fasted jerboas, we measured the expression level of genes coding for peptides well known to regulate food intake, NPY and POMC, as well as RFRP-3 because this later peptide displays marked sex-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and season-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> dependent variations in seasonal mammals, including the jerboa. In fasted females, central Kp increased <italic>Pomc</italic> mRNA, with a stronger effect in spring as compared to autumn, which is in agreement with the observed anorexigenic effect of the Kp10 injection. Central Kp also decreased the number of <italic>Rfrp</italic> mRNA expressing neurons in spring, not in autumn. In fasted males, Kp did not alter <italic>Pomc</italic> and <italic>Rfrp</italic> mRNA levels in agreement with the lack of Kp effect on their food intake. Regarding <italic>Npy</italic> gene, Kp displayed a complex regulation with no effect in females and a season-dependent effect in males which might be related to complex sex steroid modulation of Kp action towards NPY neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.</p><p>The anorexigenic effect of Kp observed in fasted spring female jerboas appears to result from an increase in <italic>Pomc</italic> gene expression combined with an inhibition of <italic>Rfrp</italic> gene expression. The Kp effect on jerboa&#x02019;s POMC neurons is supported by earlier studies reporting in mice that POMC neurons express Kiss1r<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, are contacted by Kp fibers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and that exogenous Kp activates POMC neurons via a mechanism based on a sodium/calcium exchanger activation and non-selective cation current<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. However, activation of POMC neurons alone is probably not sufficient to account for the anorexigenic effect of Kp because the increase in <italic>Pomc</italic> mRNA level after Kp injection is observed in both seasons whereas the decrease in food intake only occurs in spring. Remarkably, Kp exhibited a marked season-dependent effect on <italic>Rfrp</italic> mRNA, with an inhibition in spring and no effect in autumn. As far as we know, this is the first report of an inhibitory effect of central Kp on <italic>Rfrp</italic> mRNA, but it is still unclear whether this effect is direct or indirect. A recent study reported that RFRP neurons in male mice do not express Kiss1r and are devoid of Kp fiber projections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. However, species or sex differences cannot be excluded since other studies showed that <italic>Kiss1r</italic> mRNA is expressed in the rat DMH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> and Kp fiber projections are found in the DMH of female mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Altogether our data indicate that in fasted female jerboas, central injection of Kp inhibits food intake in spring, but not in autumn, possibly resulting from an increase in <italic>Pomc</italic> gene expression combined with an inhibition of <italic>Rfrp</italic> gene expression.</p><p>The <italic>Rfrp</italic> gene encodes different RFRPs among which RFRP-3 regulates reproduction in various mammalian species (for review see refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Here, we reveal that RFRP-3 exerts a potent orexigenic effect in the female jerboa as central injection of the peptide induced a marked increase in food intake as early as 1&#x02009;h and up to 24&#x02009;h post-injection, with no difference between spring and autumn. We also report that this robust orexigenic effect is associated with an increase in the mRNA level of the orexigenic <italic>Npy</italic> together with a concomitant decrease in the mRNA level of the anorexigenic <italic>Pomc</italic>. Our finding of an orexigenic role of RFRP-3 in the jerboa is in agreement with previous results obtained in rats, mice, sheep and non-human primates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, but our data are the first to demonstrate that this metabolic effect might involve an increase in <italic>Npy</italic> and decrease in <italic>Pomc</italic> gene regulation. This finding is supported by earlier reports of the presence of the RFRP receptor and RFRP fiber terminals in the ARC of rodents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> with some studies showing that RFRP terminals are in close apposition to NPY<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> and POMC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> neurons. However, studies investigating the effect of RFRP-3/GnIH on POMC and NPY neuronal activity reported paradoxical results since the peptide increased FOS protein in both NPY and POMC neurons in the sheep<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, inhibited the firing rate of both POMC and NPY neurons in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> and increased <italic>Npy</italic> but not <italic>Pomc</italic> gene expression in the rat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> suggesting species-dependent hypothalamic targets of RFRP-3. In the female jerboa, our study demonstrates that RFRP-3 induces activation of NPY and inhibition of POMC neurons resulting in a robust orexigenic effect. Even though <italic>Rfrp</italic> expression is inhibited by short days in seasonal species, including the jerboa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, and RFRP receptor expression is reduced in the ARC of short-day adapted hamsters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, we observed no difference in the effect of RFRP-3 on food intake in spring compared to autumn.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates a sexually dimorphic and season-dependent anorexigenic effect of Kp in jerboas under negative metabolic state possibly via a combined increase in <italic>Pomc</italic> and decrease in <italic>Rfrp</italic> gene expression. The differential effect of Kp on females&#x02019; food intake may be related to their different sexual and energy status between both seasons. Indeed at spring, when coming out of hibernation, female jerboas are sexually active with reduced body weight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and express higher ARC Kp immunoreactivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> as compared to autumn. It might be interesting to compare Kiss1r distribution and Kp neuronal connection to POMC and RFRP neurons between spring and autumn to help understand the seasonal differences in the metabolic action of Kp. The observation that Kp injection increases <italic>Pomc</italic> mRNA in females in both spring and autumn is in agreement with previous electrophysiological studies in mice which shows that POMC neurons are directly regulated by Kp<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Furthermore, our findings that Kp inhibits <italic>Rfrp</italic> mRNA in spring, point to RFRP neurons as a target through which Kp transmits its season-dependent inhibition of food intake. Indeed, our data show a marked orexigenic effect of RFRP-3 via a combined increase in <italic>Npy</italic> and decrease in <italic>Pomc</italic> gene expression observed in both spring and autumn even in <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed female jerboas. Therefore, one might hypothesize that when female jerboas are submitted to strong reproductive and metabolic challenge in spring, Kp increases reproduction via the activation of GnRH neurons and reduces food intake by activating POMC and inhibiting RFRP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that Kp and RFRP-3 exhibit opposite stimulatory and inhibitory effects, respectively, on female rodent reproduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> and whether this is also true in female jerboas should be investigated. Additionally, this study reveals that both peptides also display opposite anorexigenic, induced by Kp, and orexigenic, induced by RFRP-3, effects through the recruitment of different metabolic hypothalamic peptides. These findings strengthen our hypothesis that reproductive activity and food intake are coordinated in wild jerboas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, and here we provide a hypothalamic model including differential roles of Kp and RFRP-3 for the understanding of synchronized seasonal regulation of reproduction and energy balance.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>Male and female sexually mature jerboas (<italic>Jaculus orientalis</italic>), weighing 100&#x02013;160&#x02009;g (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;94) were captured from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco (altitude 1565&#x02009;m) in spring (May) when they were sexually active, and autumn (October) when their reproductive activity was shut down.
