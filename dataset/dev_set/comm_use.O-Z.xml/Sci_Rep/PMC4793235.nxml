Early myeloid progenitors are the major components of HSPCs and they often undergo extensive expansion in stress as a result of myeloid-biased hematopoiesis. Yet, the precise function of early myeloid progenitors remains unclear. Here we show that during tumor progression, mouse granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs) but not common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) are markedly expanded within the bone marrow and blood of mice. Interestingly, both GMPs and CMPs freshly isolated from either tumor-bearing or na&#x000ef;ve animals are capable of inhibiting polyclonal stimuli- and alloantigen-induced T cell proliferation, with tumor host-derived cells having elevated activities. Strikingly, these early myeloid progenitor cells even display much stronger suppressive capacity than the classical myeloid-derived suppressive cells. Analysis of GMPs indicates that they express iNOS and can secrete high levels of NO. Further studies unusing iNOS specific inhibitors reveal that the immunosuppression of GMPs is, to a large extent, NO-dependent. GMPs can also efficiently induce regulatory T cell development. These studies demonstrate that early myeloid progenitors can act as immunosuppressive cells. This finding provides novel insights into the functional diversity and plasticity of early myeloid progenitor cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are a rare population of precursors responsible for continuous production of blood cells throughout life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

Moreover, pathological conditions are often associated with a profound accumulation of myeloid cells within both the bone marrow (BM) and extramedullary tissues. This so-called &#x0201c;emergency&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;demand-adapted&#x0201d; myelopoiesis is believed to provide a protective immune response by replenishing the depleted innate myeloid cells during a pathological process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>; yet, there are convincing evidences that the largely expanded myeloid cells may act to jeopardize host immunity, thus promoting disease development. Studies in the past twenty years have characterized well several suppressive myeloid populations, including myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, tumor-associated macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and regulatory dendritic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. These cell types are now generally referred to as regulatory myeloid cells, and all of them have been related to the impaired immune function accompanying stress circumstances.</p><p>Stress-induced myeloid cell expansion is not limited merely to lineages of the later stages; rather, it happens concomitantly within the early myeloid progenitor compartment. A typical example for this is the selective expansion of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs) occurring in most of primary human CD34<sup>+</sup> acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, which has also been recapitulated in AML-modeled mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Recently, Wu WC <italic>et al.</italic> further showed that the frequencies of circulating GMPs were increased four to seven fold in all types of solid tumors examined<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, suggesting a ubiquitous event of the aberrant GMP augmentation during cancer development. In addition, the phenomenon of GMP expansion has also been documented in infection and other pathological conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. So far, however, the exact function of early myeloid progenitors or whether they, like other myeloid populations with an immunoregulatory function, act to directly modulate the immunity remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we showed that both GMPs and CMPs (common myeloid progenitors) were able to strongly inhibit polyclonal stimuli- and alloantigen-induced T cell proliferation via distinct mechanisms involving the NO signaling pathway. These studies not only demonstrated a novel role for early myeloid progenitors, but also suggest that immunosuppression might represent a shared functional property for myeloid cells at different stages of differentiation.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells undergo characteristically developmental changes during tumor progression</title><p>We first explored the developmental changes of various HSPC subsets during tumor progression. We prepared BM single cell suspensions simultaneously from tumor-bearing mice and normal mice, and analyzed them by FACS. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, the relative percentages of T-GMP among total BM cells was increased to 1.31&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.13% from 0.50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.17% of N-GMP (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A,C</xref>), and the absolute cell number increased to 4.09&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.42&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> from 1.32&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.46&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> of N-GMP (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). A significant amplification of GMPs was also detected in blood of tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S1</xref>). Accumulation of MDSCs is generally believed to result from a blockade of their differentiation into mature cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The marked expansion of GMPs may provide an alternative interpretation from the upstream end for how MDSCs are expanded during tumor progression. We speculate that tumor-derived factors, e.g. GM-CSF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, might act mainly on GMPs causing their differentiation toward MDSCs; and as such, amplification of GMPs would further aggravate the augmentation of MDSCs.</p><p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) were also enormously expanded during tumor development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A&#x02013;D</xref>). Conversely, CMPs appeared to be attenuated as reflected by their significantly reduced frequency (T-CMP vs N-CMP: 0.15&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03% vs 0.24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A,C</xref>) and slightly decreased cell number (T-CMP vs N-CMP: 0.48&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> vs 0.62&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.07&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Tumor-trigged CMP downregulation has also been reported by other groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Early myeloid progenitors strongly inhibit T cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We set out to test whether GMPs would have a suppressive function. For this, BMs were isolated from tumor-bearing and normal mice, and GMPs sorted as immunophenotypically Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IL-7R<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>c-kit<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>FcR II/III<sup>+</sup> cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. We first evaluated the influence of GMPs on non-specific T cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies. As anticipated, spleen T cells proliferated vigorously when incubated in medium with or without presence of MEPs (megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors, pooled from tumor-bearing and normal mice and used as control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, addition of either tumor mice-derived GMPs (T-GMP) or normal mice-derived GMPs (N-GMP) to the cultures almost abrogated this T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Similar results were obtained when purified splenocytic CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells were cocultured with GMPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S2A</xref>), indicating that the suppression resulted simply from GMPs added rather than other types of cells present in the splenocytes. To further assess the immunosuppressive effect of GMPs and verify the results from non-specific T cell proliferation assays, mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) experiments were performed. Again, we detected a strong inhibition of allo-antigen-stimulated T cell proliferation by both T-GMP and N-GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Of note, T-GMP displayed a significantly higher activity than N-GMP in both none-specific and antigen-specific T cell proliferation assays. These data clearly indicate that GMPs are highly suppressive cells and their activities can be further potentiated under tumor conditions.</p><p>Inspired by the finding with GMPs, we subsequently examined CMPs, the first myeloid-restricted population that derives from MPPs whereas gives rise to GMPs. Using the same approaches as described above, we found that even at a low ratio of CMPs vs splenocytes (1:8), CMPs (Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IL-7R<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>c-kit<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>FcRII/III<sup>lo/&#x02212;</sup> cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) from either tumor-bearing mice (T-CMP) or normal mice (N-CMP) caused a dramatic reduction in T-cell proliferation stimulated by polyclonal stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>) or allo-antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). This suppression was also observed with sorted splenocytic CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S2B</xref>). In all these experiments, T-CMP exerted a greater activity than N-CMP, similar to that seen with GMPs. To determine whether CMPs represent the most upstream suppressive population of the hematopoietic pathway, we simultaneously tested MPPs and HSCs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>,D, addition of either cell type did not affect the non-specific and antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. Together, these results not only demonstrated a suppressive role for CMPs, but also suggest that precusor cells within the HSPC compartment might acquire suppressive ability once, or alternatively, only after they become myeloid-restricted.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Early myeloid progenitors are more suppressive than the classical MDSCs</title><p>MDSCs are a well characterized suppressive myeloid population and they are generally defined as CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Hence, we next compared the suppressive capacities of early myeloid progenitor populations and MDSCs using tumor mice-derived cells. Strikingly, at the same cell ratio (1:4, BM cells: splenocytes), both GMPs and CMPs exhibited much stronger suppressive capacity than MDSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Statistical analysis indicated that the suppressive activity of MDSCs was over 8 fold lower than T-GMP (0.648&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.043 vs 0.071&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.063, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) or T-CMP (0.648&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.043 vs 0.087&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.039, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), whereas there was no apparent difference between the two progenitor populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The extraordinarily inhibiting capability of early myeloid progenitors as compared to the late stage MDSCs argues strongly that their suppressive responses were generated by themselves rather than by progenies (<italic>e.g.</italic> MDSCs) likely derived from them.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Early myeloid progenitors-mediated suppression depends on NO production</title><p>To better understand the suppressive nature of early myeloid progenitors, we next sought to elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms. To this end, we only focused on GMPs due to the difficulty to obtain sufficient number of CMPs for assays. We first assessed whether the suppression of early myeloid progenitors is dependent upon cell-cell contact, a mechanism operative in some types of cells such as MDSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and Tregs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Using a transwell coculture system, we found that preventing the direct contact of myeloid progenitors-T cells did not alter their suppressive competency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting that GMPs inhibit T cells primarily via secretion of soluble factors or molecules. NO is the key molecule mediating T-cell inhibition of distinct suppressive cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. RT-PCR analysis indicated that freshly isolated GMPs expressed ample mRNA encoding iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and arginase 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>), two enzymes that share the same substrate but respectively catalyze L-arginine to generate NO or urea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In consistent with their abundant expression of iNOS, both T-GMP and N-GMP secreted large amounts of NO compared to MEP controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). To demonstrate a direct involvement of NO in the suppressive effect of GMPs, T-cell proliferation was examined in the presence of specific inhibitor (<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>G</italic></sup>-monomethyl-L-arginine, L-NMMA) for iNOS. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>, addition of L-NMMA could effectively reverse the T-cell suppression of GMPs in a dose-dependent manner. The saturated response of L-NMMA was achieved at a concentration of 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;M for T-GMP or 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M for N-GMP, which also mirrored their NO production abilities, pointing to a differed activation status between the two cell types. In contrast, inclusion of arginase inhibitor (<bold>nor</bold>-NOHA) in the cultures failed to change the suppressive effect of T-GMP or N-GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>), further demonstrating a critical role of NO synthesis in the process. Noteworthily, blockade of NO production could not completely overcome the suppressive effect of T-GMP or N-GMP, implying that additional pathways may participate in the inhibitive process of these cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GMPs induce regulatory T cell development</title><p>Different immunosuppressive myeloid populations including MDSCs have been shown to be capable of inducing Tregs and employ them as an indirect mechanism to assume their suppression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. To test whether this pathway is potentially involved in the suppressive effect of early myeloid progenitors, we assessed the ability of GMPs to induce Treg development. Remarkably, when cocultured with splenocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, GMPs stimulated a significant proportion of CD4 T cells to become Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>), and a higher level of induction was detected with cells from tumor-bearing mice (T-GMP) than those from normal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The varied expression of Foxp3 in different sets of cultures was confirmed by FACS-sorting CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells and analyzing them for Foxp3 level by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). More interestingly, when re-incubated with fresh splenocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells purified from GMP cultures showed a much stronger suppression than those from MEP cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>), matched well to their abundances of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>cells among the respective CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cell populations, indicating that GMP-induced Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells were functionally competent Tregs. These results suggest that early myeloid progenitors might also act to suppress T-cells indirectly through induction of Tregs.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have provided firm evidence that early myeloid progenitors can act as immunosuppressive cells in addition to being hematopietic precursors. With well-established experimental systems, we showed that mouse GMPs and CMPs, two earliest populations of the myelopoietic tree, exhibited robust suppression against both non-specific and antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated, by using GMPs as an example, that the immunosuppression of early myeloid progenitors was NO-dependent but could not be fully accounted for by this single pathway, since at the saturated concentration of iNOS inhibitors they still retained around 30% of suppressive capacity. Early myeloid progenitors also could efficiently induce Treg development and expressed mRNA encoding Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S3</xref>). It remains to be determined whether these molecules or pathways are virtually or to what extent involved in the suppressive process of early myeloid progenitors.</p><p>Somewhat unexpectedly, in this study we consistently observed that both GMPs and CMPs recovered from naive mice also possessed suppressive ability albeit with a lower activity compared to their tumor-activated counterparts. Notably, coinciding with their suppressive capabilities, normal mice-derived GMPs produced less NO than those from tumor mice, which was confirmed by their differed requirement of L-NMMA dose to overcome the suppressive effect as demonstrated in assays with iNOS inhibitors. Similar differences were also detected in induction of Tregs. It is likely that early myeloid progenitors might present in steady status with a physiological level of suppressive activity, which could be further exacerbated under stress. It would be interesting and necessary to determine whether the distinct pathways involved are subject to regulation by the same or different mechanism in future study. The inherently suppressive progenitor cells, as compared to other immunoregulatory cell types within the BM, such as Tregs, MDSCs, and MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, may formulate an additionally but also physically advantageous layer of protection against immune reactions to ensue the orderly commitment and generation of hematopoietic cells.</p><p>An immunosuppressive function has been recognized for various myeloid populations. Among the most scrutinized are MDSCs, a heterogeneous population consisting of primarily monocytic- and granulocytic-like cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. MDSCs are defined on the basis of two hallmark features: immature and myeloid origin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, and therefore it is widely considered that MDSCs may encompass myeloid populations at earlier stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that promyelocytes, the precursors of granunocytes, were also immunosuppressive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Although the relationship of early myeloid progenitors and MDSCs still needs further evaluation given their remarkable difference in suppressive capacity, the data presented here and those mentioned above undoubtedly provide further evidence that immunosuppression is likely a shared functional property for immature myeloid cells. In addition, that early myeloid progenitors (at least for GMPs) can function as suppressive cells is also supported by several other lines of studies. First, we previously demonstrated that a GMP-like cell population derived from either mouse ES cells or BM HSCs can prevent effectively the development of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) following adoptive transfer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Furthermore, like the <italic>ex vivo</italic> GMPs tested herein, those <italic>in vitro</italic>-generated cells also display much stronger suppressive capacity than CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in T-cell proliferation assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Second, Young MR <italic>et al.</italic> reported that tumor-induced suppressive cells within BM phenotypically resemble the GMP cells in a murine LLC model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Third, during cancer development GMPs are selectively enriched in tumor sites, and their levels correlate positively with disease progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, suggesting a negative control of GMPs in tumor immunity.</p><p>HSPCs are increasingly appreciated as both precursors and effectors. An interesting and important aspect emerging from this study is that our data may provide valuable clues to dissecting and understanding the potentially novel functions of HSPCs. For instance, an immunosuppressive nature of HSPCs has long been implicated by their potent induction of transplantation tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Our finding of CMPs and GMPs (but not HSCs and MPPs) being suppressive cells offers a plausible explanation concerning the cellular basis behind the immunosuppression of HSPCs, and suggests that their suppressive effect might be contributed exclusively by the myeloid progenitor subpopulations. Besides, numerous studies have demonstrated that circulating HSPCs harbor a population called innate Th2 cytokine-producing cells critical for inflammatory diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. It will be interesting to determine in future if there are any functional or even lineage links between these proinflammatory cells and the suppressive myeloid progenitors.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that early myeloid progenitors can act as immunoregulatory cells. This finding provides unique insights into the functional diversity and plasticity of early myeloid progenitor cells; and particular significantly, it also raises the possibility that harnessing the earliest populations of myelopoietic pathway may prove useful in generating novel therapeutic interventions for myeloid cell-associated immune dysfunction in pathological settings.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals and reagents</title><p>Female C57BL/6 (B6) and BALB/c mice at 8&#x02013;10 weeks of age were purchased from SLAC Ltd.
