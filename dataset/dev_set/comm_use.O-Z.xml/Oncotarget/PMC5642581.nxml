Over a third of the patients diagnosed with CRC will die within 5 years, mostly from widespread metastatic disease [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Targeted therapy approaches are currently only being used to treat patients with metastatic CRC, outlining the need to identify additional therapeutic targets which may help to prevent tumor dissemination.</p><p>RHAMM (Receptor for Hyaluronic Acid Mediated Motility/HMMR/CD168) was first characterized as a protein involved in cell locomotion. Today, RHAMM is known to be a versatile protein, typically activated in wound healing [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and found on the cell surface, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus of many different cell types [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In response to hyaluronic acid (HA), TGF-&#x003b2; or PDGF [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], RHAMM can activate various signaling cascades. For instance, by binding to proteins such as ERK1/2 [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], FAK [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], or Src [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], RHAMM was reported to activate the respective pathways. Additionally, RHAMM can target MEK1 and ERK1/2 to the cytoskeleton and nucleus, thus regulating mitotic spindle integrity, cell cycle progression, and expression of genes governing reorganization and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is functionally linked to key centrosomal proteins such as the Aurora kinase A [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and is essential for bipolar spindle formation and cell division fidelity [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Overexpression of RHAMM has been linked to disease progression in many solid [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and haematological cancers [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We have previously described RHAMM as an independent adverse prognostic factor in mismatch repair (MMR) proficient tumors in a cohort of 1420 CRC patients [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Further analyses confirmed that the prognostic impact of RHAMM ranked above other established prognostic factors, such as tumor grade and vascular invasion [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additionally, in a recent study, we have analyzed RHAMM expression in highly aggressive tumor cells, termed tumor buds [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These are defined as clusters of up to 4 cells at the invasive front and thought to be detached, motile tumor cells in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal-like transition and metastatic dissemination. A high number of buds at the invasion front is one the strongest adverse prognostic factor in CRC [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We speculated that RHAMM overexpression on tumor buds would increase motility, invasion into lymph and blood vessels and dissemination, thus contributing to an adverse outcome. Indeed, the presence of RHAMM-positive tumor buds correlated strongly with aggressive clinicopathological features and added significant prognostic information to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, based on our previous studies, and the literature describing the many key processes this protein is involved in, RHAMM can be described as a very promising prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target in CRC. Previous molecular signaling pathway studies indicate that RHAMM could be a direct driver of cell proliferation and migration, which might contribute to early metastatic dissemination, which has, to our knowledge, never been tested in CRC. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of RHAMM expression on the proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasive potential of CRC cell lines and the growth and tumorigenicity of CRC tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. We additionally use RNA sequencing to identify specific transcripts and pathways which are characteristic for patients with RHAMM positive or negative CRC tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Patient survival is correlated to RHAMM expression in tumor cells</title><p>First, we re-tested the ability of RHAMM expression to predict survival in a new, well characterized colorectal cancer cohort.

However, whether RHAMM expression is a direct cause of tumor spreading remained unclear. Here, to test direct causation, we analyzed the effect of RHAMM knockdown on cell cycle, proliferation, migration, the invasion potential and tumorigenicity of CRC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, to try and better understand the underlying causes of RHAMM effects on tumor cell behavior in CRC, we also evaluate the differences in various cellular pathways by testing genes expression in primary tumors discordant for RHAMM by RNA-Seq [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>We originally described RHAMM as a potential prognostic factor in colorectal cancer patients [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the present study we can confirm on a new, well characterized cohort, that patients with RHAMM high CRC tumors have a shorter survival time.</p><p>To select an appropriate cellular system, we measured RHAMM levels in 8 different, commonly used CRC cell lines. All showed high and comparable levels of intracellular RHAMM, and cell surface expression could additionally be induced by incubation with hyaluronic acid (HA), as previously described for other cell types [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We selected representative MMR positive (MMR+) HT29 and negative (MMR-) HCT116 cell lines for further assays. Interestingly, <italic>in vitro</italic>, both MMR+ and MMR- RHAMM- cells were less motile, had lower invasive capabilities, and displayed reduced proliferation rates and occupancy of S and G2/M cell cycle phases.</p><p>Notably, effects of RHAMM silencing on proliferation and cell cycle were only detectable in the presence of HA (data without HA not shown). As the interaction partner of RHAMM in the ECM, HA is present in different forms in quiescent and in inflamed tissues, including the tumor stroma, where it is degraded by reactive oxygen species and secreted enzymes to a much smaller, pro-inflammatory low molecular weight oligomer (LMWHA [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). This degraded molecule can be bound to alternate combinations of receptors, and elicits different downstream responses within a cell [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, in the future it would be advantageous to establish a 3D co-culture setting to test the effect of RHAMM downregulation in the presence of HA of varying sizes.</p><p>RHAMM deficient cells were significantly less tumorigenic <italic>in vivo</italic>. Subcutaneous tumor formation was more rapid in mice injected with RHAMM+ compared with RHAMM- cells. The tumors likewise reached a much larger overall size. Unfortunately, this subcutaneous tumor model of CRC yields compact tumors with a largely predominant pushing border, in which we could not detect any tumor buds in either group, and could therefore not measure a change in bud numbers or infiltration depth. Nevertheless, RHAMM silencing virtually abolished the ability of HCT116 and HT29 cells injected into the tail vein to form metastases. While the majority of mice injected with RHAMM+ cells developed multiple metastases in the liver, lung, kidney and lymph nodes, only a single mouse injected with RHAMM- cells developed a metastasis, and only in a single organ. This suggests that RHAMM is not only necessary for the dissemination of the primary tumor by contributing to proliferation, migration and invasion, but for some stage in the colonization of the secondary site as well. Our data are in line with previous reports describing a similar capacity of RHAMM to promote migration, extravasation and metastasis [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] formation in non-small cell lung carcinoma [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], melanoma [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with data obtained with cell lines, RNA-Seq of primary tumors discordant for RHAMM revealed that its overexpression is associated with gene expression patterns characteristic for weaker cell-cell and cell-substrate attachment, higher cell motility and increased proliferation. However, further studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying potential direct or indirect interactions between RHAMM and the identified genes.</p><p>Taken together, our findings show for the first time that RHAMM has a strong, direct effect on proliferation, migration and infiltration of CRC cell lines and tumors derived thereof, and suggest that this protein might serve as a possible target in CRC.</p><p>There are previous reports of targeting RHAMM in humans. In acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and multiple myeloma, RHAMM activates cellular and humoral immune responses, and was thus chosen as a target for an anti-RHAMM peptide vaccination approach [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which had some success in initial clinical trials. In these diseases, however, the specificity of the approach was an issue, as RHAMM was only weakly expressed on leukemic stem cells. Nevertheless, targeting RHAMM in CRC could prove more promising, as normal colonic mucosa is only sporadically and weakly positive for RHAMM. Therefore, a similar strategy might be fairly specific for tumor cells.</p><p>We propose that targeting RHAMM could specifically inhibit the growth and dissemination of CRC by targeting the main tumor body as well as tumor buds and micrometastatic initiator cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Patient selection for next generation tissue microarray (ngTMA) construction</title><p>A well-characterized cohort of 335 non-consecutive, unselected colon cancer patients treated at the Inselspital in Bern, Switzerland between 2002 and 2011 was retrospectively included in this study.

Ninety-four patients were excluded from the original cohort based on pre-operative treatment (n=51) or insufficient material (n=43) remaining on the tissue block. The ngTMA included two 0.6 mm tissue punches (cores) each from tumor center, tumor front, tumor stroma (including buds) and normal colorectal mucosa of 241 patients.

An ngTMA spot was scored only when it contained more than 100 tumor cells. Normal mucosa served as an internal control, and RHAMM was evaluated as overexpressed in tumors when it exceeded the percentage of signal found in normal tissue (5%). The scoring was done both by eye by a postdoctoral fellow focusing on RHAMM (LS), an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist (HD), blinded to clinical data, and by a digital quantification software (HALO, Indica Labs v1.94).
