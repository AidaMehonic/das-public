The lack of effective targeted therapies for TNBC represents an unmet therapeutic challenge. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) is an atypical calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase that promotes TNBC tumorigenesis, progression, and drug resistance, representing a potential novel molecular target. However, the mechanisms regulating eEF2K expression are unknown. Here, we report that eEF2K protein expression is highly up-regulated in TNBC cells and patient tumors and it is associated with poor patient survival and clinical outcome. We found that loss/reduced expression of miR-603 leads to eEF2K overexpression in TNBC cell lines. Its expression results in inhibition of eEF2K by directly targeting the 3-UTR and the inhibition of tumor cell growth, migration and invasion in TNBC. <italic>In vivo</italic> therapeutic gene delivery of miR-603 into TNBC xenograft mouse models by systemic administration of miR-603-nanoparticles led to a significant inhibition of eEF2K expression and tumor growth, which was associated with decreased activity of the downstream targets of eEF2K, including Src, Akt, cyclin D1 and c-myc. Our findings suggest that miR-603 functions as a tumor suppressor and loss of miR-603 expression leads to increase in eEF2K expression and contributes to the growth, invasion, and progression of TNBC. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-603-based gene therapy is a potential strategy against TNBC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>eEF2K</kwd><kwd>triple negative breast cancer</kwd><kwd>liposomes</kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>miR-603</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy among women and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Every year in the United States, nearly 232,000 cases of invasive breast cancer and 65,000 cases of <italic>in situ</italic> breast cancer are diagnosed, and more than 40,000 women die to breast cancer [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. BC is a highly complex and heterogeneous disease with distinct biological and clinical behaviors [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. BC is classified into five major subtypes according to molecular features and intrinsic expression of the genes encoding the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2): luminal A (ER and/or PR positive and HER2 negative), luminal B (ER or PR positive and HER2 positive), HER2 overexpressing, normal-breast like and basal-like or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) phenotype [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>TNBC accounts for approximately 10-20% of all cases of breast cancer and is characterized by the absence of yet defined molecular targets, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, therapies targeting ER (i.e., tamoxifen) and HER2 (also known as eERB2) (i.e., trastuzumab) are ineffective against TNBC [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The other important characteristics of TNBC include aggressive clinical behavior, early relapses, and metastasis as well as reduced sensitivity to conventional therapies. The poor clinical outcome and short overall patient survival predominantly attributed to intratumoral heterogeneity and mutated TP53, which is detected in up to 84% of TNBC cases [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A better understanding of the biology of TNBC and the underlying molecular mechanisms are needed to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop highly effective targeted therapies for improved patient outcomes [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Recently, emerging evidence has revealed that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) is a potential molecular driver in several cancers, including pancreatic, brain and breast cancer [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. eEF2K is the only calcium/calmodulin activated member of the &#x003b1;-kinase family and is considered an atypical kinase since its catalytic domain is not structurally similar to those of conventional protein kinases [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. eEF2K activity is regulated by multiple mechanisms to control the rate of protein chain elongation by phosphorylating/inactivating eEF2 (at threonine 56), which mediates the movement of the ribosome on transfer RNA (tRNA) from the A site to the P site [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. eEF2K promotes cell survival in conditions of nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and metabolic stress by regulating the rate of translation [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Recently, eEF2K was shown to promote cell proliferation, cell migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and TNBC tumorigenesis and progression through modulating the cell cycle (G1/S transition) by regulating cyclin D1, c-myc, PI3K/Akt, Src/Fak and insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) signaling [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therapeutic targeting of eEF2K triggers apoptosis and suppresses TNBC tumor growth, in addition to and increased doxorubicin and paclitaxel efficacy [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These reports suggest that eEF2K is a critical factor for breast cancer progression and the strategies aimed at manipulating the activity of eEF2K may aid the development of novel treatment regimens for TNBC.</p><p>Non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNA) have emerged as new regulators of gene expression across various biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, metabolism and aging. miRNAs are involved in many diseases such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and but they also play an a vital role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and clinical applications as therapeutics [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. miRNAs can be used to classify a wide variety of human cancers with particular signatures and define the molecular architecture of human cancers [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. miRNAs are 18-25 nucleotides in length and regulate the expression of target genes at the posttranscriptional level through interaction with complementary sequences usually found in the 3&#x02019;-UTRs of target mRNAs, resulting in inhibition of translation and/or in mRNA degradation [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Several oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs have been identified as the promoters of tumor formation and growth when aberrantly expressed in various cancers [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Oncogenic miRs are frequently over-expressed in cancer tissues, including miR-21, miR-17-92, miR-155 and miR-372, while miRs such as miR-34 and the <italic>let-7</italic> family miR-15a and miR-16-1 are considered as tumor suppressors and their expression is often reduced in cancer tissues [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Over the years of studies, growing evidences have shown that miRNAs have an important role in breast cancer progression, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Apparently, some miRNAs functionally take part in several important cell proliferation pathways such Src, and MAPK and the aberrant expression of these miRNAs is responsible for evading growth suppressors and sustaining proliferative signaling in breast cancer cells [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. miRNA 603 (miR-603) was recently identified through genome-wide analysis in glioblastoma [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and thyroid cancer with a potential role in cell transformation [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However the role of miR-603 in breast cancer has not been characterized previously and was the focus of the current study.</p><p>This study demonstrates for the first time that miR-603 functions as tumor suppressor in TNBC and its expression plays an important role in TNBC cell proliferation, migration/invasion, and tumorigenesis through the regulation of eEF2K. Our data also suggest that miR-603-based gene therapy or eEF2K targeted approaches may be a potential therapeutic strategy against TNBC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>eEF2K expression is upregulated in TNBC cell lines and patient tumors</title><p>To evaluate eEF2K expression in TNBC we determined the protein expression level of eEF2K in TNBC cell lines and patient tumors by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively.

The results showed that eEF2K mRNA levels were upregulated in TNBC cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). To identify miRNAs that target and regulate eEF2K gene expression, we used four different algorithms that predict the mRNA targets of miRNAs: TargetScan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org/cgi-bin/targetscan/vert_70">http://www.targetscan.org/cgi-bin/targetscan/vert_70</ext-link>), miRDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mirdb.org/cgi-bin/search.cgi">http://mirdb.org/cgi-bin/search.cgi</ext-link>), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microRNA.org">microRNA.org</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microrna.org/microrna/searchGenes.do">http://www.microrna.org/microrna/searchGenes.do</ext-link>), and Diana microT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/">http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/</ext-link>) to select miRNAs that may target eEF2K. Based on this target prediction strategy, miR-603 was the common miRNA that targets eEF2K in all four database (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). We also selected miR-3613-3p and miR-3163 that were common in the three of the databases for binding scores for targeting eEF2K (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p><p>The basal expression levels of miR-603, miR-3613-3p, and miR-3163 in TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and BT-20) were compared to their expression levels in MCF-10A cells by qPCR. Only miR-603 expression was lower in all three TNBC cell lines than in MCF-10A cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), suggesting an inverse relationship of miR-603 to eEF2K and potential role for miR-603 directly binding eEF2K mRNA and regulating its expression. The basal expression levels of miR-3613-3p and miR-3163 did not show any correlation with eEF2K expression in TNBC cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized based on target prediction tools and the inverse correlation that eEF2K is a direct target of miR-603 in human TNBC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>miR-603 expression suppresses eEF2K in TNBC cells</title><p>Since miR-603 is markedly downregulated in TNBC cell lines, we ectopically overexpressed miR-603 in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and BT-20 cells and measured changes in the expression of eEF2K mRNA and protein levels.

We also demonstrated that eEF2K is highly overexpressed in TNBC cells and reduced or loss of miR-603 expression contributes to upregulation of eEF2K and TNBC tumor growth and progression.</p><p>We previously reported that EF2K signaling is one of the critical drivers of TNBC tumorigenesis and its inhibition suppresses tumor growth and significantly enhances the efficacy of most commonly used chemotherapeutics in TNBC tumor models [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The current study indicated that the majority of TNBC patient tumors (66.6%) are strongly positive for eEF2K expression by IHC. Our study also demonstrated that reduced miR-603 expression leads to increased eEF2K expression in TNBC cells, providing the first evidence regarding the mechanistic-basis of eEF2K overexpression in TNBC. Considering that eEF2K contributes to poor patient survival and prognosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and plays a cytoprotective role in response to treatments that induce energy stress and cytotoxic effects through induction of autophagy [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and promotes cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, drug resistance and invasion, reduced or loss of miR-603 seems to be a critical factor leading to induction of eEF2K. Furthermore, our analysis of TCGA databases also indicated that miR-603 tumor suppressor is undetectable in majority of breast cancer samples, preventing us to perform Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with regard to overall survival analysis, suggesting that miR-603 is frequently dysregulated in breast tumors.</p><p>Recently, reduced miR-603 has been implicated in malignant transformation of thyroid cancer cells in response to high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) expression [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Interestingly, HMGA1 has been proposed to be a master regulator of tumor progression in TNBC by providing oncogenic signaling and metastatic phenotype, EMT and reprogramming TNBC cells into cancer-stem cell like state as well as poor prognosis in breast cancer patients [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, future studies are needed to determine if the HMGA1 plays a role in miR603/eEF2K axis and HMGA1 expression leads to downregulation of miR603 and upregulation of eEF2K expression.</p><p>eEF2K is involved in inducing effects on multiple signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt, c-myc, and Src/Fak to promote a number of processes associated with migration/invasion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The results of the current study indicate that <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> overexpression of miR-603 recapitulates the effects of eEF2K suppression in TNBC, including inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth. Not surprisingly, the induction of miR-603 expression in TNBC tumors in mice led to inhibition of PI3K/Akt and Src, further indicating that regulation of these pathways by miR-603 is mediated by inhibition of eEF2K. Furthermore, therapeutic targeting of miR-603 by mimic or eEF2K by siRNA-based therapeutics inhibits tumor growth in an orthotopic xenograft model of breast cancer [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], suggesting that strategies targeting miR-603/eEF2K axis may provide broad antitumor effects through inhibition of multiple oncogenic pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Schematic model of the regulatory pathways involving miR-603 and eEF2K in triple-negative breast cancer</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-08-11641-g007"/></fig><p>eEF2K expression is associated with resistance to frontline chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel, and eEF2K knockdown in an <italic>in vivo</italic> orthotopic model of breast cancer suppresses the growth of established breast cancer tumors and sensitizes the tumors to these chemotherapeutics [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], indicating the role of eEF2K expression in patient survival and prognosis. Thus, future studies combining miR-603-based therapy with chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel or doxorubicin expected to provide significant enhancement in the antitumor efficacy in TNBC models and elucidate the underlying mechanisms regarding why TNBC patients with higher eEF2K expression have poor clinical outcome and shorter survival.</p><p>Given that reinstatement of miR-603 expression in TNBC is associated with inhibition of tumor growth and down regulation of eEF2K, strategies targeting eEF2K directly (i.e., siRNA or inhibitors) or indirectly by targeting its regulators such as miR-603 may be a potential therapeutic approach against TNBC. Recently we identified FOXM1 as the first transcription factor that regulates eEF2K expression in TNBC and its inhibition not only reduces eEF2K expression in TNBC also significantly suppresses TNBC tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], indicating that understanding mechanism of eEF2K regulation and identification of upstream regulators could also provide foundation for development of novel therapeutic strategies for TNBC, which has poor clinical outcome and patient survival rates due to lack of effective molecularly targeted therapies.</p><p>Since many biological disorders result from aberrant gene expression or gene mutations, miRNA replacement therapy represents a promising therapeutic approach by targeting genes that are involved in many pathological processes [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In fact, miRNAs are being evaluated in clinical trials in the United States as a therapeutic modality against cancer [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Because of the potential of miRNA-based therapies, involving reconstitution of tumor suppressor miRNAs or suppression of oncogenic miRNAs [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], to affect multiple targets or pathways, miRNAs have rapidly garnered attention as a novel class of therapeutics that can be used to modulate gene expression or regulate undruggable targets.

Restoration of miR-603 expression appears to suppress various hallmarks of cancer and may be a potential therapeutic approach against TNBC.
