To investigate which lncRNAs contribute to trastuzumab resistance, we screened a microarray of lncRNAs involved in the malignant phenotype of trastuzumab-resistant SKBR-3/Tr cells. Expression of the lncRNA GAS5 was decreased in SKBR-3/Tr cells and in breast cancer tissue from trastuzumab-treated patients. Inhibition of GAS5 promoted SKBR-3 cell proliferation, and GAS5 knockdown partially reversed lapatinib-induced inhibition of SKBR-3/Tr cell proliferation. GAS5 suppresses cancer proliferation by acting as a molecular sponge for miR-21, leading to the de-repression of phosphatase and tensin homologs (PTEN), the endogenous target of miR-21. Moreover, mTOR activation associated with reduced GAS5 expression was required to suppress PTEN. This work identifies GAS5 as a novel prognostic marker and candidate drug target for HER2-positive breast cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>trastuzumab</kwd><kwd>lapatinib</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>lncRNA GAS5</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>HER2 overexpression and amplification are detected in 15%&#x02013;20% of breast cancers and correlate with poor prognosis and short survival [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Additionally, inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin increases the expression of GAS5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). In summary, GAS5, regulated by mTOR pathway, serves as a ceRNA of miR-21 to regulate PTEN in the development of breast cancer trastuzumab resistance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Lapatinib upregulates GAS5 through activation of mTOR pathway</title><p><bold>a.</bold> Lapatinib treatment increased p-Akt and p-mTOR protein expression. <bold>b.</bold> Rapamycin blocked lapatinib induced expression of GAS5. <bold>c.</bold> EGFR signaling pathway is important in the development and progression of various human tumors.

Beyond the well-known HER2 and EGFR, other pathways, such as HER3 or insulin-like growth factor receptor, activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR, overexpression of c-MET or up-regulation of Src activity, and loss of PTEN or MUC4, are involved [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies link lncRNAs to the development of chemoresistance. For example, a differentially expressed lncRNA ARA was validated in MCF-7/ADR and HepG2/ADR cells [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. LncRNA-UCA1 increases cisplatin resistance during bladder cancer chemotherapy by increasing the expression of Wnt6 and thus represents a potential target to overcome bladder cancer chemoresistance [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. lncRNA ATB is among the most upregulated lncRNAs in trastuzumab-resistant SKBR-3 cells and in the tissues of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer patients [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Given their important regulatory effects on cancer progression, we infer that a relationship exists between lncRNAs and trastuzumab resistance. GAS5 was among the 15 most downregulated lncRNAs in SKBR-3/Tr cells by genome-wide microarray analysis; reduced GAS5 expression was verified by qPCR. GAS5 knockdown induced SKBR-3 cell viability and strengthened Ki-67 expression.</p><p>Knockdown of GAS5 promoted cell proliferation and tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. GAS5 expression was markedly decreased in the tumor tissues relative to surrounding non-cancerous tissue. Low GAS5 expression in breast cancer patients correlated with histological grading and advanced TNM stage. These findings indicate that GAS5 is reduced by trastuzumab and may act as a tumor suppressive gene regulator in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer.</p><p>To overcome the limitations of trastuzumab, new agents targeting different signaling pathways are urgently needed. The small-molecule lapatinib is classified as a dual inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2, preventing downstream signaling events [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We confirmed that lapatinib suppresses the proliferation of SKBR-3/Tr cells by upregulation of PTEN and GAS5. Lapatinib inhibition of cell growth was impaired by knockdown of GAS5 with downregulation of PTEN in this study. These findings suggest that lapatinib partially inhibits the proliferation of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells through the upregulation of PTEN and GAS5. Multiple signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin, are activated by EGFR to enhance proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We demonstrate that inhibiting mTOR signaling by rapamycin reversed the GAS5-induced upregulation of PTEN.</p><p>Given the important regulatory effects of PTEN and GAS5 on trastuzumab resistance, we infer that a relationship exists between PTEN and GAS5. Several RNA transcripts, including lncRNAs, have been identified as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), such as CCAT1 and H19 [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous studies showed that GAS5 functions as a ceRNA for miR-21, and that miR-21 promoted tumor proliferation and invasion by targeting PTEN [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As a tumor suppressor, GAS5 enhances PTEN expression by inhibiting miR-103 expression in endometrial cancer [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, we found GAS5 functions as a molecular sponge for miR-21, increasing PTEN expression. The GAS5 transcript level was correlated with PTEN mRNA level and protein level in breast cancer tissues.</p><p>From a broader perspective, the identification of GAS5 as an important prognostic factor for breast patients warrants further investigation of its functional roles. This study may provide a strategy and facilitate the development of GAS5 directed diagnostics and therapeutics against trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Tissue samples and clinical data collection</title><p>Human breast cancer specimens (n = 86) were obtained from the Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University.

The grades were multiplied to determine a score.</p></sec><sec id="s4_5"><title>MTT assay and colony formation assay</title><p>Cell proliferation was tested with the tetrazolium salt 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reagent (MTT, Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> cells were plated in each well of the 96-well plates with 200 &#x003bc;L medium. Prior to analysis, 20 &#x003bc;L of MTT (2.5 mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. The medium was then removed, and the cells were solubilized in 150 &#x003bc;L of dimethylsulfoxide for colorimetric analysis (wavelength, 490 nm) on a microplate spectrophotometer. Growth values were calculated as follows: (OD treated cells/OD untreated cells) &#x000d7; 100. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and cell proliferation curves were plotted using the absorbance at each time point.</p><p>For colony formation assay, 100 cells were plated into six-well plates and incubated in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS at 37&#x000b0;C. After 7 days, the cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The number of colonies was counted. The experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4_6"><title>qRT-PCR assay and western blot assay</title><p>For qRT-PCR, total RNA was extracted from tissues or cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA).

GAPDH antibody was used as control. Autoradiograms were quantified by densitometry. Anti-Ki67 and anti-PTEN antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (CA. USA). All experiments were conducted three times, and the median and mean values were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4_7"><title>Animal studies</title><p>Female athymic BALB/c nude mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions and manipulated according to standard protocols.
