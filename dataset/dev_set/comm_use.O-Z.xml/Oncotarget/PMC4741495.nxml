However, its effects on tumor suppression are controversial and its roles in development and malignancy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In the present study, we found that EMP3 was highly expressed in the tumorous tissues comparing to the matched normal tissues, and negatively correlated with differentiated degree of HCC patients. Knockdown of EMP3 significantly reduced cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle at G1 phase, and inhibited the motility and invasiveness in accordance with the decreased expression and activity of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in HCC cells. The <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth of HCC was effectively suppressed by knockdown of EMP3 in a xenograft mouse model. The EMP3 knockdown-reduced cell proliferation and invasion were attenuated by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or knockdown of Akt, and rescued by overexpression of Akt in HCC cells. Clinical positive correlations of EMP3 with p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, p-Akt, uPA, as well as MMP-9 were observed in the tissue sections from HCC patients. Here, we elucidated the tumor progressive effects of EMP3 through PI3K/Akt pathway and uPA/MMP-9 cascade in HCC cells. The findings provided a new insight into EMP3, which might be a potential molecular target for diagnosis and treatment of HCC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>epithelial membrane protein-3</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers and a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, particularly in Southeast Asia including China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, and sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Development of HCC is a multistep process, in which the chronic infections of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and liver cirrhosis are closely relevant [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The disease is often diagnosed at an advanced stage due to the asymptomatic lesion in an early stage of HCC. Only around 30% of patients are eligible for curative therapies, such as surgery or ablation. Treatment options of the other intermediate/advanced metastasized HCC are limited as transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), radioembolization, and systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy and sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, clinical outcomes of these unresectable HCC patients are still unfavorable. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of malignancy of HCC will provide novel molecular target for a potential therapeutic strategy.</p><p>In addition to late diagnosis of HCC patients, cancer metastasis is one of the critical causes of poor clinical outcome or mortality [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The process of metastatic spread of cancers is complicated including cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] are involved in degradation of ECM, which is a critical step in the metastatic process. The uPA network consists of uPA, uPA receptor (uPAR), plasminogen, plasmin, and the negative regulators, plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs), PAI-1 and PAI-2 [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. uPA activates a serine proteinase plasmin to degrade the components of ECM by proteolytic cleavage of inactive zymogen plasminogen, leading to promotion of invasion of cancer cells. Increase of uPA cascade [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and activity of MMPs [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have been demonstrated in invasion and metastasis of HCC. Thus, we aimed to investigate the upstream signaling of uPA and MMPs in malignancy of HCC in the current study.</p><p>Human epithelial membrane protein-3 (EMP3) located on chromosome 19q13.3 was first identified by homology screening of databases [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. EMP3 encodes a 163 amino-acid protein containing 4 transmembrane domains, and belongs to the peripheral myelin protein 22-kDa (PMP22) gene family of small hydrophobic membrane glycoproteins due to the high amino acid sequence homology [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The expression of EMP-3 is found in most tissues including liver, and higher in peripheral blood leukocytes, ovary, intestine and various embryonic tissues [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The functions of EMP3 are still unclear and controversial. EMP3 has been proposed to be a tumor suppressor gene, which is silenced by hypermethylation on its promoter region in glioma [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], neuroblastoma [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and non-small cell lung cancer [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Its promoter methylation concomitant with the loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 19q has been observed in the grade II oligodendroglioma patients at a higher risk of relapse and disease progression-free interval [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The potential tumor suppressive function of EMP3 has also been reported to be repressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast, other reports do not support EMP3 as a candidate of tumor suppressor gene and suggest its function in tumor aggressiveness. Overexpression of EMP3 is found in oligodendroglial tumors [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and primary breast carcinomas without altering DNA methylation [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recently, EMP3 has been demonstrated to promote cell proliferation and migration and its co-expression with ErbB2 is unfavorable for progression-free and metastasis-free survival in patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Although EMP3 transcripts can be detected in liver, the roles of EMP3 in HCC development and malignancy remain unknown so far. In the present study, we demonstrated the potential roles of EMP3 in tumor aggressiveness of HCC cells, and found that EMP3 was highly expressed in the tumorous tissues comparing to non-tumorous tissues of HCC patients. Knockdown of EMP3 reduced cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle at G1 phase, and inhibited the abilities of cell migration and invasion accompanied with a decrease of the expression and activity of MMP-9 and uPA in HCC cells. The suppression of cell proliferation and malignancy caused by silencing EMP3 of HCC cells was mediated with down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. The study provided a new insight into EMP3, suggesting that EMP3 enhances malignancy of HCC cells, and it might be a potential molecular target for diagnosis and treatment of HCC patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>EMP3 is highly expressed in tissue sections from HCC patients and in HCC cell lines</title><p>To clarify the correlation between EMP3 and development of human HCC, We examined the expression of EMP3 protein by Western blot in HCC tissues and matched non-tumorous tissues. Of 16 HCC tumors, 13 expressed higher levels of EMP3 than non-tumorous tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining was conducted on a tissue microarray containing samples from 74 patients of HCC tissues and 20 normal hepatic tissues. Higher levels of EMP3 in HCC tissues were evidenced compared with normal hepatic tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Consistently, the expression of EMP3 was significantly negatively correlated with degree of differentiation in HCC patients (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.031). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between EMP3 expressions in age, sex, and tumor stage of HCC tissues (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed expression of EMP3 in 5 human HCC cells (HA22T/VGH, SK-Hep-1, Huh-7, PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2) and one normal hepatic cell (THLE-2), the expression levels of EMP3 in poor differentiated HCC cell lines, HA22T/VGH and SK-Hep-1, were much higher than that in moderate differentiated PLC/PRF/5 and Huh-7 and well differentiated HepG2 cell lines, and lowest in THLE-2 normal hepatic cell line, as determined by immunoblotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Taken together, EMP3 was conversely associated with differentiation of HCC, suggesting its potential roles in malignancy of HCC.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>EMP3 is highly expressed in tissue sections from HCC patients and in HCC cell lines</title><p><bold>A.</bold> The expression of EMP3 was examined by immunoblotting.

Overexpression of EMP3 resulted in growth inhibition and TERT repression in ESCC cell lines [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Releasing A549, a NSCLC cell line, from serum starvation to trigger its cell cycle progression repressed the expression of EMP3 [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, overexpression of EMP3 is related to retain chromosomes 1p and 19q in oligodendroglial tumors [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and relevant to histological grade III, lymph node metastasis, and strong Her-2 expression in primary breast carcinoma [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recently, functional crosstalk between EMP3 and ErbB2 has been reported. Overexpression of EMP3 promotes cell proliferation and migration and is clinically associated with poor patient survival and metastasis-free survival. Co-expression of EMP3 and ErbB2 is worse for progression-free and metastasis-free survival in patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our study, we found that knockdown of EMP3 suppresses cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, invasion, and tumor growth of HCC cells. Clinical significance is also observed, namely higher expression of EMP3 in tumorous tissues and associated with poor differentiated stage of HCC patients. These aforementioned studies indicate the potential tumor promoting functions of EMP3 in other cancer types including oligodendroglioma, breast carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and hepatoma, suggesting that the roles of EMP3 in cancer progression might depend on cancer types.</p><p>The activation of p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K results from the binding of its p85 regulatory subunit to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Activated PI3K catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), which in turn activates phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), leading to activation of Akt. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway affects multiple cellular processes including cell proliferation, survival, and motility [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Activation of PI3K by ErbB2, which has kinase activity and lacks p85-binding sites, depends on assistance of ErbB3, which lacks tyrosine kinase activity and possesses six p85-binding sites, for recruitment of PI3K. Transactivation of heterodimer of ErbB2-ErbB3 is important oncogenic signaling involved in the PI3K/Akt pathway [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that ErbB2 and EMP3 reciprocally up-regulate each other accompanied with activation of PI3K/Akt pathway to promote proliferation and migration of human bladder cancer cells [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the present study, knockdown of EMP3 reduces the expression and association of p85 subunit of PI3K to inactivate Akt, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. It is possible that EMP3-regulated p85 expression and association might be probably related to expression or activation of RTKs, such as ErbB2-ErbB3. In addition, it has been reported that EMP3 interacts with C terminus of P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) involved in cell blebbing [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recently, the promoting effects of P2X7R on tumor growth have been demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the clinical positive-correlation of P2X7R has been also observed in many cancers [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The roles of EMP3 in activation of PI3K by ErbB2-ErbB3 and in tumor promotion by P2X7R need to be further explored.</p><p>In addition, EMP-1, one of EMP family members, has also been reported to be involved in activation of PI3K/Akt pathway in lung cancer. They demonstrated that EMP-1 was significantly up-regulated in NSCLC patients comparing to that in benign patients. Overexpression of EMP-1 resulted in increasing cell proliferation of PC9 NSCLC cells in accordance with activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. EMP-1 promoted tumor growth of PC9 cells was also observed <italic>in vivo</italic> in a nude mouse xenograft model [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast, the expression of EMP-3 was suppressed in proliferating A549 NSCLC cells [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although the amino acid sequences of EMP family members are highly homologous, their functions in lung cancer progression are diverse, suggesting that the downstream signaling pathways of EMPs are critical in their effect on tumor progression. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by EMP-1 in NSCLC cells [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or by EMP-3 in HCC cells in the current study promoted tumor aggressiveness.</p><p>The uPA/MMPs cascade has been demonstrated to be involved in malignancy of HCC [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in particular MMP-2 [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and MMP-9 [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For instance, MMP-2 and uPA are involved in osteopontin-mediated metastasis [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Expression of MMP-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is closely related to invasion and metastasis [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Expression of MMP-2 and cytokeratin 19 are independent risk factors for prediction of lymph node metastasis and survival [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Several signaling pathways mediated by different modulators have been known to activate MMP-9 in invasion and metastasis of HCC cells, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) axis by epimorphin [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], NF-kappa B by interleukin 23 [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway by Bmi-1 [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In contrast, the expression of MMP-9 is repressed by miR-491 [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and forkhead box transcription factor A2 (FOXA2) [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition, membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and MMP10 [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] are also involved in metastasis of HCC cells. MT1-MMP increases invasion and intrahepatic metastasis by degradation of ECM, and enhances cell survival upon challenge of detachment of HCC cells [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. C-terminal truncated hepatitis B virus x (HBx) protein promotes invasiveness and metastasis of HCC cells by activating MMP10 through C-Jun [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our study reveals that EMP3 contributes to tumor aggressiveness by MMP-9 and uPA, but not MMP2, on the PI3K/AKT pathway in HCC cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>The antibodies against EMP3, &#x003b2;-actin, p21, p27, SKP2, cyclin E, cyclin D1, MMP-9, uPA, p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-Akt (Ser473) Akt, p85 subunit of PI3K, p110 subunit of PI3K, Ki-67, siRNAs against mock (neo), Akt (siAkt), and (siERK) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).
