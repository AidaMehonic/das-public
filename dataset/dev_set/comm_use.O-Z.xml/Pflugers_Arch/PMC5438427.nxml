The hypoxia-induced effects were elucidated at the cellular and isolated mitochondria levels. Hypoxia elevated fermentation but did not change mitochondrial biogenesis or the aerobic respiratory capacity of endothelial cells. In endothelial cells, hypoxia caused a general decrease in mitochondrial respiration during carbohydrate, fatty acid, and amino acid oxidation but increased exclusively ketogenic amino acid oxidation. Hypoxia induced an elevation of intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, although cell viability was unchanged and antioxidant systems (superoxide dismutases SOD1 and SOD2, and uncoupling proteins (UCPs)) were not increased. In mitochondria from hypoxic cells, the opposite change was observed at the respiratory chain level, i.e., considerably elevated expression and activity of complex II, and decreased expression and activity of complex I were observed. The elevated activity of complex II resulted in an increase in succinate-sustained mitochondrial ROS formation, mainly through increased reverse electron transport. A hypoxia-induced decrease in UCP2 expression and activity was also observed. It can be concluded that the exposure to chronic hypoxia induces a shift from aerobic toward anaerobic catabolic metabolism. The hypoxia-induced increase in intracellular and mitochondrial ROS formation was not excessive and may be involved in endothelial signaling of hypoxic responses. Our results indicate an important role of succinate, complex II, and reverse electron transport in hypoxia-induced adjustments in endothelial cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mitochondria</kwd><kwd>Hypoxia</kwd><kwd>Endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>Oxidative metabolism</kwd><kwd>Mitochondrial respiration</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Know Poznan RNA Centre, Poland</institution></funding-source><award-id>01/KNOW2/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koziel</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki (PL)</institution></funding-source><award-id>2012/07/N/NZ3/00495</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koziel</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016/21/B/NZ3/00333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarmuszkiewicz</surname><given-names>Wieslawa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Jagiellonian Medical Research Centre Foundation, Poland</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>As the first cell layer in contact with blood, endothelial cells have to cope with various physiological and pathophysiological changes within the blood components. One challenging stimulus is deficiency in the oxygen tension. The response of endothelial cells to hypoxic stress can have two different consequences in the surrounding tissues, depending on the duration of the exposure: (i) short-term exposure causes physiological and reversible modulation of vascular tone and blood flow, and (ii) chronic hypoxic stress results in irreversible remodeling of the vasculature and surrounding tissues with smooth muscle proliferation and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Persistent hypoxia occurs frequently in many disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, atherosclerosis, sickle cell disease, and systemic sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Hypoxia is also observed in ischemia and cancer. In endothelial cells, hypoxia initiates a number of responses that include cell growth and proliferation, increased permeability, and changes in cell-surface adhesion molecules. The two endothelium-dependent pathways involving cyclooxygenase (COX) and endothelium nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) are activated in hypoxic augmentation. Exposure of pulmonary artery endothelial cells to hypoxia triggers a retrograde mitochondrial movement, resulting in the perinuclear clustering of mitochondria accompanied by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Endothelial mitochondria may act as oxygen sensors in the hypoxic response signal cascade and produce more mitochondrial ROS (mROS), which are important signaling molecules in vascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. NO produced by endothelial cells can regulate the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1-&#x003b1;) and 5&#x02032;AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), affecting key hypoxia and metabolic stress response pathways, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It remains unclear how mROS production in endothelial cells triggers ROS production from other cellular sources and activates AMPK, which can alter fuel selectivity and protect cells from apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Some studies suggest that endothelial mitochondria regulate HIF-1&#x003b1; and HIF-2&#x003b1; stabilization by releasing mROS to the cytosol and subsequently restrain ROS production in chronic hypoxia to avoid cellular damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In endothelial cells, mitochondria are central mediators of intrinsic apoptosis, which is initiated by cellular stressors, including hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It has also been proposed that endothelial mitochondria may sense hypoxia and transmit, via mROS, a signal to the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] that in turn releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In pulmonary artery hypertension, mitochondrial signaling modulates the chronic response of the pulmonary circulation to hypoxia. Decrease in mitochondrial glucose oxidation provides several advantages to endothelial cells, including diversion of pyruvate into anabolic pathways, suppression of apoptosis, promotion of cell proliferation, and activation of the HIF-1, which increases pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) expression, thus sustaining mitochondrial suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The influence of hypoxic exposure of endothelial cells, especially chronic exposure to hypoxia, on mitochondrial oxidative function has not been intensively studied. Many questions must be addressed with respect to understanding the role of endothelial mitochondria in response to hypoxia-induced metabolic disturbances that may lead to the development of vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Thus, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the effects of a chronic 6-day hypoxic exposure of cultured human endothelial EA.hy926 cells to 1% O<sub>2</sub> on aerobic metabolism at the cellular and mitochondrial levels. Cell viability, superoxide formation, and mitochondrial respiratory function, including the respiratory response to different reducing fuels and mitochondrial oxidative capacity, were monitored in hypoxic cells. Moreover, we examined the effect of chronic exposure of growing endothelial cells to hypoxia on mitochondria by measuring their respiratory activities with complex I and complex II substrates, ATP synthesis, mitochondrial membrane potential (m&#x00394;&#x003a8;), mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP)-mediated uncoupling, and mROS formation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture and cell fraction preparation</title><p>We used the human endothelial cell line EA.hy926 (ATCC&#x000ae; CRL-2922&#x02122;), which was originally derived from a human umbilical vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Cells were grown in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine, 2% hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The EA.hy926 cells were cultured for 6 days in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C at 20% O<sub>2</sub> (normoxic conditions) or 1% O<sub>2</sub> (hypoxic conditions).

Cells that were used in this study were between passages 5 and 12.</p><p>EA.hy926 cells from both the control and hypoxic cultures were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (containing 10 or 5% FBS), and centrifuged at 1200<italic>g</italic> for 10&#x000a0;min. Subsequently, the cells were washed in cold PBS and then centrifuged again. The final cell pellet was resuspended in PBS (1&#x000a0;g of cells per 2&#x000a0;ml of medium) and maintained on ice. Protein content was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The yield of harvested cells differed significantly between the control and the hypoxia-treated cells.

To estimate the contribution of ATP-linked OCR and non-ATP-linked OCR (proton leak) to the basal respiratory rate, oligomycin (1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml) was added to inhibit ATP synthesis. Subsequently, the proton ionophore (uncoupler) carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) was added to determine the maximal oxygen uptake that the cells could sustain. Finally, cyanide (0.5&#x000a0;mM) was added to inhibit complex IV (cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, COX) and thereby block the entire mitochondrial cytochrome pathway.

Non-phosphorylating (resting state, state 4) respiration measurements were performed in the absence of exogenous ADP.</p><p>The proton leak UCP-mediated measurements were performed with 5&#x000a0;mM succinate (plus 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M rotenone) as an oxidizable substrate, in the presence of 1.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M carboxyatractyloside and 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml oligomycin, which inhibit the activities of the ATP/ADP antiporter and ATP synthase, respectively. The response of proton conductance to its driving force can be expressed as the relationship between the oxygen consumption rate and the m&#x00394;&#x003a8; (flux-force relationship) when varying the potential via titration with respiratory chain inhibitors. To decrease the rate of the coenzyme QH<sub>2</sub>-oxidizing pathway, succinate dehydrogenase was titrated with cyanide (up to 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M).

</p><p>We determined how aerobic metabolism in endothelial EA.hy926 cells supplied with different reducing fuels was altered by long-term cell growth at 1% O<sub>2</sub>. In general, under all respiratory conditions and with respect to all reducing fuels except the exclusively ketogenic amino acids lysine and leucine, hypoxic cells displayed reduced mitochondrial function (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In particular, cells exposed to hypoxia exhibited &#x0223c;13&#x02013;25% reductions in their maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity in the presence of pyruvate, glucose, palmitic acid, or amino acids (glutamine, valine, and threonine) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, e). Similarly, with pyruvate and glutamine, a significantly reduced ATP-linked OCR was observed in hypoxic cells, indicating diminished levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Interestingly, a significant reduction of non-ATP-linked OCR was also found during oxidation of all substrates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), indicating decreased proton leak in hypoxic cells. Thus, mitochondrial respiratory measurements indicate a general reduction in mitochondrial respiration during carbohydrate, fatty acid, and glucogenic amino acid oxidation in hypoxia-exposed endothelial cells. In contrast, the maximal oxidation of lysine and leucine was significantly higher in hypoxic cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e), indicating a greater contribution from exclusively ketogenic amino acids as a fuel source for endothelial respiration during growth under hypoxic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Growth in hypoxic conditions increased mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial superoxide generation in endothelial cells</title><p>Compared with the normoxic cells, the exposure of EA.hy926 cells to chronic hypoxia caused a significant elevation in total (&#x0223c;80%) and mitochondrial (&#x0223c;75&#x02013;100%) superoxide generation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

No change in the UCP3 expression level was found. Therefore, we attribute the hypoxia-induced changes in UCP activity, described below, to UCP2.</p><p>To determine whether UCP2 activity is changed due to the growth of EA.hy926 cells under hypoxic conditions, we evaluated the activation of UCP2 by a free fatty acid (linoleic acid) or a lipid peroxidation product (HNE), and the inhibition by GTP in isolated endothelial mitochondria (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). In general, in non-phosphorylating mitochondria isolated from hypoxic cells, the stimulatory effect of linoleic acid or HNE and the inhibitory effect of GTP were weaker than the effects observed in control mitochondria. An analysis of the proton leak kinetics indicates that for specific linoleic acid (14&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) and GTP (4&#x000a0;mM) concentrations, the linoleic acid-induced, GTP-inhibited, UCP2-mediated proton leak (UCP2 activity) at the same m&#x00394;&#x003a8; (162&#x000a0;mV) was &#x0223c;18% lower in mitochondria from the hypoxic cells than it was in the control mitochondria (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d, left panel).

In vitro cell culture and functional studies with isolated mitochondria are useful in understanding the physiological role that mitochondria play in endothelial cells and the contribution of endothelial mitochondria to hypoxia-induced response. However, there may be some differences in cellular and mitochondrial effects in arteries or in microvascular endothelial cells in vivo.</p><p>The hypoxia-induced responses in aerobic metabolism are well documented, for instance, in cancer and brain cells (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]) but this issue has not been intensively studied in endothelial cells. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine for the first time the effects of chronic hypoxia on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in endothelial cells, including the effects on isolated endothelial mitochondria. The hypoxia-induced endothelial metabolism changes were supported by a significantly increased level of HIF1-&#x003b1;. The comparison of the mitochondrial respiratory functions of EA.hy926 cells cultured in hypoxic or normoxic conditions demonstrates that deficiency in O<sub>2</sub> tension induces a general reduction in mitochondrial respiration supplied with carbohydrate catabolic intermediates (glucose or pyruvate), lipid metabolism intermediate (palmitic acid), and amino acids (glutamine, valine, or threonine) whereas cellular respiration with exclusively ketogenic amino acids (lysine or leucine) was significantly increased. The increased oxidation of ketogenic amino acids, which are directly degraded to acetyl-CoA, suggests that the TCA cycle is not impaired in hypoxic endothelial cells in contrast to pyruvate-dependent oxidation. Moreover, in mitochondria from hypoxic EA.hy926 cells, the oxidation of palmitoylcarnitine and the expression of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase were significantly decreased, confirming a hypoxia-induced decrease in fatty acid metabolism. Thus, similar to cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], in endothelial cells, hypoxia inhibits fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation, another major source of acetyl-CoA. In our study, in mitochondria from hypoxic endothelial cells, the oxidation of pyruvate and the expression of the E3BP component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were unaltered, suggesting that there are other factors downregulating pyruvate-linked oxidation. It has been previously proposed that activation of HIF1-&#x003b1; induces pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), which inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and decreases respiration by substrate limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The above described metabolic responses observed in this study indicate that this HIF1-&#x003b1;-coordinated regulatory pathway decreasing the TCA cycle activity under hypoxic exposure seems to also occur in endothelial cells. However, limiting mitochondrial fuel oxidation may provide some metabolic advantages to endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia, including the diversion of pyruvate into anabolic pathways and the reduction of apoptosis by hyperpolarized m&#x00394;&#x003a8;.</p><p>In EA.hy926 cells grown for 6&#x000a0;days in hypoxic conditions, the decreased respiration in the presence of glucose was accompanied by elevated expression of hexokinase I and elevated expression and activity of LDH. Thus, in addition to the reduction in aerobic glucose oxidation, endothelial hypoxic cells display enhanced anaerobic glycolysis, which seems to be an important energy source under hypoxic conditions. Our results with endothelial cells are consistent with previous observations from other cell types, namely that hypoxia affects energy metabolism and HIF1-&#x003b1; activates transcription of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes to further increase flux of reducing equivalents from glucose to lactate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>It has been well documented that the exposure of endothelial cells to hypoxia leads to increased intracellular ROS production and therefore oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Under our experimental conditions, a significant increase in intracellular ROS and mROS generation was also observed. However, the hypoxia-induced oxidative stress does not seem to be excessive for endothelial cells because they maintained cell viability. Moreover, no change in the expression levels of the cytosolic and mitochondrial superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD2, respectively) and UCP2, proteins of the antioxidative systems, was observed. Thus, there was no need for protection against the overwhelming oxidative stress, and increased levels of mROS may be involved in endothelial signaling. Increased mROS are now known to be biologically important in a variety of physiological systems, including adaptation to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For instance, cells can utilize an acute increase in mROS to stabilize HIF under hypoxic conditions and subsequently restrain mROS production under chronic hypoxic conditions to avoid cellular damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our study indicates that the observed decrease in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism of endothelial cells may help mROS in not exceeding the buffering capacity of superoxide dismutases. Therefore, cell viability of endothelial cells exposed to chronic hypoxia remains unchanged.</p><p>Because the activities of COX and CS and the expression level of mitochondrial marker proteins remained unchanged, it appears that the chronic growth of EA.hy926 cells in hypoxia did not change their maximal aerobic respiration capacity or mitochondrial biogenesis. However, our measurements of mitochondrial function in isolated endothelial mitochondria indicate that hypoxia induced important remodeling of the oxidative phosphorylation system at the level of respiratory chain dehydrogenases. In mitochondria from hypoxic endothelial cells, the considerably elevated protein expression and activity of complex II contribute to an increase in m&#x00394;&#x003a8; and succinate-sustained mROS formation mainly through increased reverse electron transport. It has been previously reported that in endothelial cells, complex II-driven electron flow is the primary means by which the mitochondrial membrane is polarized under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another interesting finding from this study is that, in mitochondria from hypoxic endothelial cells, a reduction of expression and maximal malate-sustained activity of complex I was accompanied by an increase in oxidation of other weaker than malate NAD-linked substrates &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate or isocitrate. Thus, hypoxia-induced reduction of the oxidative phosphorylation system of endothelial mitochondria was found only during malate-sustained complex I activity. Interestingly, it has been reported that lack of oxygen deactivates mitochondrial complex I in many cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It has also been proposed that hypoxia induces reprogramming of respiratory chain functions and switching from oxidation of complex I substrates to succinate oxidation (complex II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The dissociation of complex I from the large mitochondrial supercomplexes has been observed under hypoxic conditions, when succinate accumulates as a substrate for complex II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is well documented that in mammalian cells, hypoxia is connected with activation of succinate dehydrogenase and succinate oxidation and with increased contribution of the latter to respiration and energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Under hypoxic conditions, complex II may function as an independent enzyme whose activity is limited only by substrate availability. Hypoxia inhibits the malate-aspartate shuttle, which provides &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate to the cytosol, whereas succinate synthesis is intensified.</p><p>We have previously shown that one physiological role of UCP2 in endothelial cells could be the attenuation of mROS production under conditions of excessive oxidative stress, such as exposure to high glucose or palmitic acid concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Results of this study indicate that, in response to hypoxia during endothelial cell growth, UCP2 activity and protein levels were slightly but significantly decreased in mitochondria, even intracellular and mitochondrial ROS formation was increased. Reduction in UCP2 activity leads to higher m&#x00394;&#x003a8; and consequently increased mROS production. Thus, in hypoxic endothelial cells, one physiological role of UCP2 could be ensuring efficient oxidative phosphorylation yield rather than the attenuation of mROS production.</p><p>In mammalian cells, multiple mitochondrial products, including the TCA cycle intermediates and mROS, can coordinate prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) activity and, thereby, HIF stabilization, hence the cellular response to oxygen deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Accumulation of succinate and fumarate inhibits PHDs, leading to an elevated level of HIF, whereas &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate facilitates PHD action, leading to HIF degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In our study, in hypoxic endothelial cells, no change in activity of CS, a pace-making enzyme of the first step at the TCA cycle, was observed. However, the observed increase in mitochondrial oxidation of isocitrate, &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate, and glutamate (upstream of succinate oxidation) and the decrease in malate oxidation (downstream of succinate oxidation) could be relevant for maintaining the high level of succinate and fumarate despite the elevated activity of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II). Moreover, significant amelioration of mitochondrial oxidation of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate may lead to suppression of cytosolic &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate accumulation in endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia. It has been reported that in mammalian cells, especially cancer cells or other highly proliferating cells, ROS, including mROS, are crucial to activating HIF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A precise role for mROS in regulating HIF1-&#x003b1; is unclear, but the pathway stabilizing HIF1-&#x003b1; appears undoubtedly mitochondrial dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our study indicates that under hypoxic conditions, endothelial mitochondria also function as an oxygen sensor and convey signals to HIF1 likely through elevated mROS, accumulation of succinate and decreased levels of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate. Thus, it seems that in endothelial cells, coordinated signaling between HIFs (at least HIF1-&#x003b1;) and the mitochondria regulate the cellular response to chronic hypoxia.</p><p>In conclusion, the growth of endothelial cells under chronic hypoxic conditions induces numerous changes in their aerobic metabolism (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), particularly a general decrease in mitochondrial respiration except for the increased oxidation of exclusively ketogenic amino acids. The hypoxia-induced increases in intracellular and mitochondrial ROS production do not lead to overwhelming oxidative stress because cell viability and antioxidant systems (superoxide dismutases and UCPs) are not upregulated. The hypoxia-induced increase in mROS formation could result from decreased mitochondrial UCP2-mediated uncoupling and mainly from remodeling of mitochondrial respiratory chain functions with the elevated activity of complex II and decreased activity of complex I. In mitochondria from hypoxic cells, the increased activity of complex II results in an amelioration of succinate-sustained mROS formation mainly through increased reverse electron transport. These observations highlight the role of endothelial mitochondria in response to metabolic adaptations related to hypoxia. The chronic hypoxia-induced decrease in aerobic glucose oxidation may lead to some advantages to endothelial cells, including diversion of pyruvate into anabolic pathways, suppression of apoptosis, preservation of cell proliferation, and activation of the HIF-1, which sustains mitochondrial suppression through increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) expression. Understanding the details of mitochondrial regulation of chronic hypoxia-induced response in endothelial cells could have clinical relevance and pave the way for new therapies related to hypoxia-associated pathologies.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Effects of chronic exposure to hypoxia on endothelial cells and their mitochondria, which are observed in this study. <italic>SOD1</italic> and <italic>SOD2</italic> superoxide dismutases, <italic>OXPHOS</italic> oxidative phosphorylation system</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="424_2017_1935_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig>
