They are commonly produced by chemical synthesis which involves the use of harmful reducing agents. Contras, the laser technique is able to generate high-purity Ag NPs in water with specified surface charge characteristics. In the past, the molecular mechanisms contributing to the bactericidal effects of Ag NPs have been investigated extensively, but little is known of the antibacterial and toxic effects and mechanisms involved in laser-generated Ag NPs. In the current study Ag NPs were generated by picosecond laser ablation. Their antibacterial activity was determined on the gram-negative bacteria <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and the gram positive bacteria <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> including the methicillin resistant strain MRSA. Results showed that the laser generated Ag NPs exhibited strong dose-dependent antibacterial activity against all the three bacterial strains tested. Using <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> as a model system, the laser Ag NPs treatment induced significantly high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS did not include detectable hydroxyl radicals, suggesting for the first time the selective ROS induction in bacterial cells by laser generated Ag NPs. The increased ROS was accompanied by significantly reduced cellular glutathione, and increased lipid peroxidation and permeability, suggesting ROS related bacterial cell damage. The laser generated Ag NPs exhibited low toxicity (within 72 hours) to five types of human cells although a weak significant decrease in cell survival was observed for endothelial cells and the lung cells. We conclude that picosecond laser generated Ag NPs have a broad spectrum of antibacterial effects against microbes including MRSA with minimal human cell toxicity. The oxidative stress is likely the key mechanism underlying the bactericidal effect, which leads to lipid peroxidation, depletion of glutathione, DNA damages and eventual disintegration of the cell membrane.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work is funded by Kurdistan regional government as a PhD studentship.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="23"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fast appearance of new bacterial strains resistant to current available antibiotics has become a growing obstacle to public healthcare. Almost 5,000 hospital deaths per year were caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDR) such as methicillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) in the UK alone [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This increase in the pathogenic bacterial resistance to drugs motivated the search for new antimicrobial therapeutic agents [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and nanoparticles (NPs) are considered to be good candidates for this purpose. The unique physical and chemical properties of NPs associating to their ability to inhibit microbial growth or kill microbes led to increased research in order to enhance their antibacterial efficacy and specificity, reduce their toxicity to human cells, and understand the mechanisms behind their actions. In the past decade numerous types of NPs have been developed for antibacterial applications. Although efforts have largely been devoted to the development of drug carrier platforms using mainly organic NPs, metallic NPs still stand out as promising therapeutic agents due to their direct antimicrobial activities. Several metallic NPs including silver (Ag), copper (Cu), titanium (Ti), Zinc (Zn), and their oxide derivatives were identified to exhibit antimicrobial effects, among which Ag NPs are the most popular and widely used in both clinical practice and domestic consumables [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Silver has historically been widely known to have antibacterial properties [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nano-silver greatly enhances the functionality of the material and it has been used in diverse healthcare applications including but not limited to wound dressings, bandages, ointments, lotions, water purifications and medical devices [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] as well as protective agents for patients with HIV [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Most importantly, Ag NPs have a broad spectrum of antibacterial qualities against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and do not contribute to the development of resistance strains. Therefore, Ag NPs have the potential to be widely used against drug resistance bacteria such as MRSA. It is estimated that, as an antimicrobial agent, silver nanoparticles have an annual demand of 3,125 tons/year for medicine and 2,800 tons/year in the field of food, hygiene and water purification [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Metallic NPs can be produced in several different ways including physical, chemical, and biological methods [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite successful applications, most of the methods are still expensive owing to the use of hazardous chemicals [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Laser ablation in aqueous phase is considered a unique technique that is simple and fast, and able to produce NPs in any desired concentration with high purity without relying on chemical reactions. Therefore the laser produced NPs are ideal for medical applications and environmentally friendly too [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Most importantly, the metallic NPs generated by laser ablation have different surface properties compared to their counterparts generated by chemical methods. One of the unique properties is the surface charge [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which makes the NPs prone to interacting with the negatively charged bacterial surfaces and proteins, making them ideal for targeting microbes. Although the molecular mechanisms contributing to the bactericidal effects of Ag NPs have been investigated extensively in the past, there has not been sufficient documentation on laser-generated Ag NPs. To our knowledge, few publications have addressed the antibacterial effects of laser-generated Ag NPs and vary little information on the action mechanisms has been provided [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. None of the information is on biological mechanisms and toxicity of picosecond laser generated Ag NPs.</p><p>The exact mechanisms through which Ag NPs exert their antibacterial effect are still under investigation. It was observed, that Ag NPs, by interacting with bacterial cell membranes through making pits and holes, accumulate inside bacterial cells where they bind to important cellular machineries, damaging cell function [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition to the physical interactions, the release of silver ion (Ag<sup>+</sup>) is considered as an important mechanism for the bactericidal effect of Ag NPs. The interaction between positively charged Ag<sup>+</sup> and the negatively charged bacterial cell surface disrupt the selective permeability and structure of the bacterial cell membrane [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], resulting in protein leakages [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. After having penetrated bacterial cell, Ag<sup>+</sup> interacts with DNA and ribosomes resulting in DNA damage and influencing the protein translation. Ag<sup>+</sup> also interacts with the thiol group of proteins and essential enzymes in the cellular respiratory chain, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-1</sup>), hydroxyl radical (&#x000b7;OH) and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) leading to cell death. The oxidative damage caused by the ROS generation is considered a key mechanism that, synergistic with the effect of Ag<sup>+</sup>, underlies the bacterial killing activities of Ag NPs [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Despite the therapeutic potential, the use of Ag NPs has been largely limited to non-<italic>in vivo</italic> applications, such as medical dressings. This is mainly due to considerations of their potential toxicity to humans [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Numerous studies have demonstrated the toxicity of metal nanoparticles to human cells [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, a study by Asharani et al attributed the toxicity of Ag NPs on human lung epithelial cells to the formation of ROS which leads to oxidative stress and cell damage [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Paddle-Ledinek et al also demonstrated the cytotoxic effect of Ag NPs extracted from wound dressings (Acticoat) to human keratinocytes [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The cytotoxicity of Ag NPs were also determined on other cell types such as human fibrosarcoma cells [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the liver cells of rats [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] via mechanisms including DNA damage, apoptosis, depletion of antioxidant glutathione, reduction in the potential of mitochondria membrane and ROS formation. In addition, the absorption of Ag NPs into the blood from wound dressing was observed which led to argyria symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>However, data provided by the published studies on the toxicity of Ag NPs to different mammalian cells had large variations. It was noticed that Ag NPs acted on both human and bacterial cells, but the toxicity to human cells was very low compared to that of bacterial cells when the same concentration was used [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This may be due to the differences in the cell membrane structures between mammalian and bacterial cells and the existence of endocytic machinery and multiple intracellular compartments in human cells which prevent the NPs from easily penetrating the membranes to interact directly with important molecules within the cells. The human immune system serves as an additional protective barrier for the clearance of NPs [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Additionally, the discrepancies seem also to rely on the manufacturing methods and the size of the NPs as well as the cell types used in the toxicity study. For these reasons there has been no general consensus concerning the toxicity of Ag NPs to human cells [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, there has been a lack of information about the toxicity to humans of laser generated Ag NPs.</p><p>We recently produced Ag NPs using a picosecond laser ablation method [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, we sought to conduct a comprehensive analysis on the antibacterial activities, the molecular mechanisms underlying their bactericidal effects, and the toxicity to human cells of the picosecond laser generated Ag NPs. We have demonstrated a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities for the laser generated Ag NPs on both gram-negative bacteria <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and the gram-positive bacteria <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> such as MRSA. We identified multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the bactericidal effects of laser Ag NPs, and determined their toxicity to different types of human cells originating from the lungs, skin, blood vessels, kidneys and the liver. We anticipate that our data would contribute to a better understanding of laser generated NPs in general and pave the way for future applications for laser generated Ag NPs in healthcare.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Nanoparticles production</title><p>Nanoparticle production by pulsed laser ablation was described in our previous publication [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

The Ag plate was then immersed in 20 ml of dH<sub>2</sub>O in a glass vessel. A picosecond pulsed Nd: YVO4 laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm was used to ablate the Ag plate at a high scanning speed at a pulse repetition rate of 200 kHz, beam spot size 125 &#x003bc;m and an average power of 9.12 W. The weight of the silver plate was measured using an analytical balance before and after laser ablation.

This is in line with other publications on the bacterial killing effects of Ag NPs in general including the work by Dror-Ehre et al, where it showed that the bactericidal activity of Ag NPs against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> relied on the ratio of NPs-cells which determines the frequency of collisions and attractions of the NP to the cells [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We also observed high susceptibilities of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> to the laser generated Ag NPs as compared to that of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160078.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This may be explained by the structural differences between gram positive and gram negative bacteria. For the gram positive bacteria, the peptidoglycan layer is thicker than gram negative bacteria which serve as a protective barrier against chemicals, toxins, derivative enzymes and antibiotics [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Importantly, in our study we have confirmed that the laser generated Ag NPs could effectively kill the methicillin resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, which provide good evidence for the future applications of laser generated Ag NPs to be used in healthcare in combatting drug-resistant microbial infection or contaminations.</p><p>In this study, the high power and high repetition rate picosecond laser was used for the production of Ag NPs. It has been shown that high repetition rate picosecond (ps) lasers are advantageous compared to femtosecond (fs) lasers if the total thermal load produced by laser irradiation can be redistributed across a larger area [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In case of laser ablation in a liquid flow, the thermal energy is dissipated into the liquid and drained by the flow. It has been shown that laser ablation in liquid produces surface-charged nanoparticles with a shell of dipole molecules (e.g., water) formed around them, preventing agglomeration [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This was experimentally supported by the zeta potential value of laser Ag NPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160078.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>The molecular mechanisms for the antibacterial effects by laser generated Ag NPs</title><p>ROS generation is one of the key molecular mechanisms underlying bactericidal effects of NPs. To confirm the same mechanisms was used by the laser generated Ag NPs, ROS was measured by two types of different ROS indicators, Hydroxyphenyl fluorescein (HPF), the hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite sensor, and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) which has a broad detection spectrum. Based on the differential detection capability of the chemicals indicators, we dissected, for the first time, that the ROS generation induced by the laser generated Ag NPs did not induce detectable hydroxyl radical (&#x000b7;OH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160078.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Our finding contradicts a publication by Hwang et al where silver nanoparticles could transmute H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into hydroxyl radical leading to apoptosis in fungal cells [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, our result agrees with a report by He et al., in which Ag NPs produced a powerful oxidant through a reaction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> and the oxidizing species did not include the free hydroxyl radical [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Hydroxyl radical is highly reactive and can damage virtually all types of macromolecules, especially the nucleic acid and lipids [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The lack of significant generation of hydroxyl radicals but large amount of other ROS species by the laser generated Ag NPs in our experiment suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying the antibacterial effect might depend on the method used for the nanoparticle production and the target microbial species. It would be interesting in a future study to compare the generation of specific ROS species induced by Ag NPs that are manufactured by different technologies. This will further clarify the specific properties of the Ag NPs that are generated by laser ablation.</p><p>We could not explain the low ROS levels when higher concentrations of (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) laser Ag NPs were present in the <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> culture. Zeta potential is one of the fundamental parameters known to reflect the stability of the colloidal dispersions by measuring the magnitude of the electrostatic repulsion or attraction between particles. The zeta potential values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160078.t001">Table 1</xref>) of the laser Ag NPs samples suggested a low aggregation tendency for Ag NPs tested at all concentrations. One possible explanation for the low ROS level at high Ag NP concentration could be the significant cell death which may have influenced the ROS measurement. More work is needed to clarify this phenomenon in the future.</p><p>ROS activates the cellular antioxidant defence system in order to maintain equilibrium balance in the redox system. The excess accumulation of ROS will eventually deplete the cellular GSH pool leading to insufficient antioxidants to overcome the accumulated ROS, resulting in cell damage [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We found that the laser generated Ag NPs caused a highly significant reduction in GSH compared to that of the control <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160078.g004">Fig 4</xref>), suggesting GSH depletion could be one of the major mechanisms underlying the antibacterial effects of the laser Ag NPs.</p><p>Bacterial cell membranes are considered to be the first barrier against ROS attachment. The poly unsaturated phospholipids are the main elements in bacterial cell membrane components. Damage to the membrane not only leads to the leakage of intracellular components, but also allows NPs to enter the cell to interact with essential enzymes in the bacterial respiratory chains, leading to respiratory inhibition and further ROS generation, contributing to cell death. MDA is a highly reactive by-product of lipid oxidation which has the ability to react with proteins and form a protein-MDA complex that is considered as a mutagenic compound. Our results showed that laser Ag NPs exposure to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>Coli</italic> has increased the production of MDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160078.g005">Fig 5</xref>), which likely contributed to the disintegration of the bacterial cell membrane. This, together with the physical interactions between NPs and the bacteria, leads to an increased permeability in the cells as evidenced by the LDH and protein leakages (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160078.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160078.g006">6</xref>), resulting in eventual cell death.</p><p>The observation of similar antibacterial effects but very low levels of Ag<sup>+</sup> released for the laser Ag NPs as compared to the chemically generated Ag NPs suggest that the Ag<sup>+</sup> ion may not be as important for the laser Ag NPs to kill bacteria as for the chemical Ag NP. This is an interesting phenomenon. It would be important for future experiments to dissect the contribution of Ag<sup>+</sup> to the overall antibacterial effect of the laser generated Ag NPs in order to identify novel applications for this type of Ag NPs.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>The toxicities of laser Ag NPs to human cells</title><p>Generally, we observed low toxicity in the laser Ag NPs to the five different types of human cells, except for the lung and endothelial cells where weak but significant influences on cell survival by the NPs were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160078.g009">Fig 9A</xref>).</p><p>The endothelial cells that line the blood vessels are highly important as the first barrier for the NPs uptake [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

This could be an adaptive effect since following a further Ag NP challenge of up to 72 hours the cell viability was equivalent to the control cells. However, the lack of toxicity at 72 hours could also be due to the uptake saturation of the NPs by the cells [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>The human respiratory system is considered to be the first organ that could be affected by exposure to NPs via inhalation, while both the cardiovascular system and the nervous system are considered as secondary organs which could be affected by NPs [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this study, the A549 cell line was sensitive to the laser generated Ag NP treatment at both low (2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) and high (20&#x003bc;g/ml) concentrations of laser Ag NPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160078.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). However, similar to what we have observed on the endothelial cells, the toxic effects were no longer present when the NPs were further incubated with the A549 cells for up to 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160078.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). The TEM images of the A549 cells showed that the laser Ag NPs had the ability to enter the cells but almost all of the intracellular Ag NPs were located in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus. This may partially explain the mild cytotoxicity of the laser Ag NPs to human cells but significant bactericidal effect to microbes where the Ag NPs could be in direct contact with bacterial DNA in the cytosol upon entering the cells. This supports the previous findings by Xu et al [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] where they showed that NPs locating in the nuclei or ribosome of the cells are more toxic than those in the cytoplasm, even at low concentrations. Nevertheless, as compared to other cell types, our results indicate that the lung cells seem relatively more susceptible to the laser generated Ag NP treatment.</p><p>The lack of significant toxic effects on the majority of cell types and conditions employed in our experiment prompt us to evaluate the reliability of our MTT assay. Using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a cytotoxic inducer, we successfully detected cell death for the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated endothelial cells and dermal fibroblasts, while no significant cell death was observed when the same population of cells were treated by the laser Ag NPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160078.g009">Fig 9B</xref>), confirming the robustness of our assays.</p><p>We did not find any significant toxic impacts of the laser Ag NPs to the kidney HEK293 cells, liver HepG2 cells and the skin fibroblasts. The lack of toxicity to the skin cells assures the safe usage of laser Ag NPs in treatment of wounds such as by being embedded in a bandage or wound dressing.</p><p>The size of NPs is considered to be critical determinant of their toxicity to both human cells and bacteria. It was noticed that NPs of a smaller size were more toxic than larger ones. This is partially because smaller sized NPs are more easily able to enter mitochondria and cause oxidative stress by stimulating ROS generation, which leads to cell death through apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0160078.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The laser Ag NPs used in our study, although clean, have a size range of 10&#x02013;100 nm with an average of 27.272 nm. A further study we will seek to carry out will separate the different sized NPs via fractionation to more precisely determine their correlation to their biological function and toxicity.</p><p>In this study we have also compared the toxicity of laser Ag NPs to chemically prepared NPs (commercial Ag NPs) to human cells. Overall, we did not observe significant differences of the human cell toxicity between the two types of Ag NPs. The size of the commercial Ag particles we used was 40 nm. The length of storage time for the commercial Ag NPs was also different from the laser Ag NPs we prepared, which may have an impact on the activity of NPs. For precise comparison, the NP size and shelf live should be taken into account in our future study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec030"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Silver NPs generated by a picosecond laser have strong antibacterial effects against both gram negative and gram positive strains including MRSA.
