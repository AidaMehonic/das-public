Moreover, pleiotropic effects of statins on the highly specialised retinal microvascular endothelium remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of simvastatin on retinal endothelium <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs) were treated with 0.01&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M simvastatin and a biphasic dose-related response was observed. Low concentrations enhanced microvascular repair with 0.1 &#x000b5;M simvastatin significantly increasing proliferation (p&#x0003c;0.05), and 0.01 &#x000b5;M simvastatin significantly promoting migration (p&#x0003c;0.05), sprouting (p&#x0003c;0.001), and tubulogenesis (p&#x0003c;0.001). High concentration of simvastatin (10 &#x000b5;M) had the opposite effect, significantly inhibiting proliferation (p&#x0003c;0.01), migration (p&#x0003c;0.01), sprouting (p&#x0003c;0.001), and tubulogenesis (p&#x0003c;0.05). Furthermore, simvastatin concentrations higher than 1 &#x000b5;M induced cell death. The mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy was used to investigate the possible effects of simvastatin treatment on ischaemic retinopathy. Low dose simvastatin(0.2 mg/Kg) promoted retinal microvascular repair in response to ischaemia by promoting intra-retinal re-vascularisation (p&#x0003c;0.01). By contrast, high dose simvastatin(20 mg/Kg) significantly prevented re-vascularisation (p&#x0003c;0.01) and concomitantly increased pathological neovascularisation (p&#x0003c;0.01). We also demonstrated that the pro-vascular repair mechanism of simvastatin involves VEGF stimulation, Akt phosphorylation, and nitric oxide production; and the anti-vascular repair mechanism is driven by marked intracellular cholesterol depletion and related disorganisation of key intracellular structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A beneficial effect of low-dose simvastatin on ischaemic retinopathy is linked to angiogenic repair reducing ischaemia, thereby preventing pathological neovascularisation. High-dose simvastatin may be harmful by inhibiting reparative processes and inducing premature death of retinal microvascular endothelium which increases ischaemia-induced neovascular pathology. Statin dosage should be judiciously monitored in patients who are diabetic or are at risk of developing other forms of proliferative retinopathy.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Statins are potent and effective inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis that are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Beyond this well-defined mode of action for statins, several clinical trials such as 4S <xref rid="pone.0002584-1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, WOSCOPS <xref rid="pone.0002584-Shepherd1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, CARE <xref rid="pone.0002584-Sacks1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and HPS <xref rid="pone.0002584-2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> have demonstrated that this class of drugs can protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD) through an additional mechanism that is independent of cholesterol lowering <xref rid="pone.0002584-Bonetti1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Guidelines from the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD in adults who have a 20&#x00025; or greater 10-year risk <xref rid="pone.0002584-NIH1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A recent meta-analysis of 14 randomised trials demonstrated benefits of statin therapy to reduce vascular mortality in diabetic patients <xref rid="pone.0002584-Kearney1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Consequently, millions of diabetic people are receiving statins <xref rid="pone.0002584-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> despite the fact that their local effects on certain tissues like the retina remain largely unknown.</p><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, and it remains a major cause of blindness and visual disability <xref rid="pone.0002584-Watkins1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The non-proliferative phase of DR is typified by progressive vasodegeneration <xref rid="pone.0002584-Mizutani1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> leading to inner retinal ischaemia. As diabetes progresses, reparative function in the retinal microvasculature is significantly impaired <xref rid="pone.0002584-Stitt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and ischaemic hypoxia drives up-regulation of angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that eventually promote a pathologic neovascular response. Retinal neovascularisation is accompanied by the formation of contractile scar tissue at the vitreo-retinal interface leading to tractional retinal detachment or vitreous haemorrhage, both resulting in severe visual loss. Extensive breakdown of the blood retinal barrier in response to ischaemia-induced VEGF expression causes diabetic macular oedema, which is also associated with retinal vasodegeneration and constitutes another sight-threatening endpoint in DR <xref rid="pone.0002584-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Simvastatin is a commonly used drug of its class that has been shown to improve diabetes-induced coronary endothelial dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0002584-Tawfik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Similarly, a clinical trial has indicated that simvastatin may retard the progression of retinopathy in diabetic patients <xref rid="pone.0002584-Sen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> although a recent case-control study found no association between statin use and the risk of developing DR <xref rid="pone.0002584-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Therefore the efficacy of statin therapy for DR is ill-defined, and although there is a potential utility for these drugs to prevent this important diabetic complication, the precise mechanism of action requires further investigation.</p><p>The actions of statins are pleiotropic and some appear contradictory. For example, these drugs promote reparative angiogenesis in murine hind limb ischaemia models <xref rid="pone.0002584-Kureishi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> but may also interfere with new blood vessel growth by inhibiting the geranylgeranylation of RhoA <xref rid="pone.0002584-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been shown that statins have a biphasic effect on endothelial cell migration, promoting the response at low concentrations, and inhibiting it at high concentrations <xref rid="pone.0002584-Urbich1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The pleiotropic nature of statin action has been demonstrated on various macro and microvascular endothelial cells although less attention has been paid to the highly specialised retinal microvascular endothelium. This is important because the effects of statins differ according to the capillary bed <xref rid="pone.0002584-Brouet1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and could have an unforeseen biphasic outcome in the retina, which could be either beneficial or harmful, especially in the context of DR. This study has investigated the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of simvastatin on retinal microvascular endothelial cell function <italic>in vitro</italic>. Additionally, a pre-clinical model of ischaemic retinopathy was used to evaluate the effects of high- and low- dose simvastatin <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Biphasic Effects of High- and Low- Concentration Simvastatin on Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cell Growth</title><p>Retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs) were exposed to concentrations of simvastatin ranging between 0.1&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M. Cells treated with 0.1 &#x000b5;M simvastatin demonstrated significantly more population doublings (PD) in 48 hours when compared to controls (1.94&#x000b1;0.06 PD versus 1.66&#x000b1;0.04 respectively). This effect was comparable to that produced by 50 ng/ml VEGF (2.16&#x000b1;0.12 PD in the same time frame). By contrast, 10 &#x000b5;M simvastatin fully suppressed cell proliferation (&#x02212;0.08&#x000b1;0.08 PD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002584-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To corroborate these findings we used the Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) proliferation assay that identifies replicating cells by their ability to incorporate BrdU into their DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle. The percentage of BrdU-positive cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002584-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). 0.1 &#x000b5;M simvastatin significantly increased the number of BrdU-positive cells which was akin to the VEGF-induced response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002584-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) while 5 and 10 &#x000b5;M simvastatin significantly decreased the number of BrdU-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002584-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Further analysis of the cell cycle using the PI staining method combined with flow cytometry confirmed that the percentage of RMECs in S phase increased by exposure to 0.1 &#x000b5;M simvastatin, whereas it decreased when cells were exposed to 10 &#x000b5;M simvastatin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002584-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Significantly, this statin-induced response could be reversed by the addition of 200 &#x000b5;M mevalonate, the end product of 3-hydroxi-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) indicating that inhibition of this enzyme by simvastatin was directly responsible for induction of cell death. Isoprenoid addition (10 &#x000b5;M Farnesol or 10 &#x000b5;M Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate) to 10 &#x000b5;M simvastatin also blocked cell death, but only partially. To confirm these results, the TUNEL in situ cell death detection kit was used. RMECs treated with different concentrations of simvastatin for 24 hours were stained for TUNEL to label DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002584-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with previous results, 10 &#x000b5;M simvastatin significantly increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002584-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This time a five-fold increase in dead cells was detected with 10 &#x000b5;M simvastatin compared to controls; the discrepancy in the results obtained was attributed to the higher sensitivity of the TUNEL assay to detect cells undergoing apoptosis while the PI-stained sub-G1 peak identifies only late apoptotic cells. Once more, mevalonate fully blocked the cell death induced by 10 &#x000b5;M simvastatin. Consistent with this result was the observation that prolonged exposure (3 days) of RMECs to 1 &#x000b5;M simvastatin induced a significant rise in dead cells (data not shown). Throughout, Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the initial solvent for simvastatin, had no effect inducing cell death at the medium concentration of simvastatin-treated cells. These results demonstrate that while low concentrations of simvastatin increased retinal endothelial cell proliferation, high concentrations inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><fig id="pone-0002584-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002584.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>High-Dose Simvastatin Induces Cell Death on RMECs.</title><p>(A) Analysis of cell death using PI staining and flow cytometry on RMECs after 24 hour-exposure to simvastatin.

However, direct extrapolation of these results to tissue levels experienced by the retina of patients has not been possible. Nevertheless, pharmacokinetic studies have previously demonstrated that serum levels of simvastatin range between 5&#x02013;30 ng/ml (0.01&#x02013;0.07 &#x000b5;M) following a single dose of 40 mg (approximately 0.6 mg/Kg) <xref rid="pone.0002584-Lilja1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It can be assumed that the retinal microvasculature is exposed at least to these concentrations <italic>in vivo</italic> and it should be appreciated that simvastatin is prescribed at &#x0201c;for-life&#x0201d; daily doses. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that therapeutic regimes of high-dose statin could lead to considerably elevated tissue accumulations of the drug, especially when considering the lipophilic nature of these compounds.</p><p>Previous reports showed that statins have a profound effect on endothelial cell function <xref rid="pone.0002584-Urbich1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002584-Weis1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Using these studies as a foundation, we have evaluated the effects of simvastatin on several aspects of reparative retinal angiogenesis. Our results indicate that simvastatin has a biphasic dose-related action on RMECs. Low concentrations were pro-angiogenic with 0.1 &#x000b5;M simvastatin significantly increasing cell proliferation, and 0.01 &#x000b5;M simvastatin significantly promoting cell migration, sprouting, and tubulogenesis. High concentrations of simvastatin (&#x0003e;5 &#x000b5;M) had the opposite effect, inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, sprouting and tubulogenesis. Furthermore it is apparent that simvastatin concentrations higher than 1 &#x000b5;M are able to induce cell death. These results indicate that although RMECs are very different to HUVECs, their biphasic response to simvastatin is similar.</p><p>To clearly elucidate simvastatin effect on the retinal vasculature <italic>in vivo</italic>, the murine OIR model was used as an appropriate system to study retinal ischaemia leading to pre-retinal neovascularisation. Although relatively acute in nature and based on neonates, the pathology of OIR enables some reasonable comparisons to the late, ischaemic phase of DR. Our results demonstrate that low dose of simvastatin (0.2 mg/Kg) promotes vascular repair in the ischemic retina and this would make it potentially beneficial for preventing vasodegeneration in the context of DR if introduced at the appropriate disease time-frame. Interestingly, the high dose of simvastatin (20 mg/Kg) decreased normal vascularisation, and increased the pathological neovascularisation when compared to controls. It is possible that because simvastatin treatment was started in the hypoxic phase (P12&#x02013;P15), the high dose actually retarded vascular recovery and increased the hypoxia which in turn led to enhanced pathological neovascularisation. The potential for high-dose statins to abrogate retinal microvascular repair and thus accelerate vasodegeneration would account for the observed enhancement of ischaemia-induced neovascularisation. This conclusion is supported by the complementary <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.</p><p>Our observed pleiotropic effects of statins on endothelial cells may be linked to multiple, inter-related pathways such as VEGF-induced cell activation, regulation of eNOS, and also key signalling responses such as Akt, Rho and Ras <xref rid="pone.0002584-Kureishi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002584-Rikitake1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002584-Ii1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In the current investigation, the data indicate that important statin-induced responses such as sprouting and tubule formation are modulated by VEGF and that the statin effects can be significantly blocked by VEGF neutralisation. Many reports have linked statin actions on endothelium to VEGF upregulation <xref rid="pone.0002584-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002584-Frick1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and since there was no exogeneous VEGF in our <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenesis assays, this could indicate an autocrine effect of low-dose simvastatin on RMECs. Further linkage to VEGF can be inferred from the finding that low dose simvastatin induces phosphorylation of Akt which is a critical pathway in endothelial cell survival and angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0002584-Shiojima1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Indeed, the Akt pathway is activated by VEGF <xref rid="pone.0002584-MoralesRuiz1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and this signalling molecule contributes to endothelial cell survival, growth, proliferation, and migration <xref rid="pone.0002584-Manning1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In addition, Akt phosphorylation activates eNOS <xref rid="pone.0002584-Fulton1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> which releases NO that, in turn, stimulates vascular remodelling and angiogenesis. Our data also show that 0.1 &#x000b5;M simvastatin increases NO production in RMECs.</p><p>High-dose simvastatin appears to have an opposing effect on the retinal microvascular angiogenic reparative process and significantly inhibits cell migration by decreasing intracellular cholesterol and reducing stress fiber formation. This result is important because endothelial cell migration and stress fiber formation are dependent on Rho activation <xref rid="pone.0002584-vanNieuwAmerongen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and statins have been shown to block isoprenylation and thus membrane localisation/ functional activation of Rho <xref rid="pone.0002584-Wolfrum1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. It is interesting to note that high-dose simvastatin causes a significant reduction of intracellular cholesterol levels in retinal microvascular endothelium. When it is considered that cholesterol is a key component of cellular membranes having different roles in cellular viability, cell migration, lipid raft assembly and cell signalling <xref rid="pone.0002584-Boukhtouche1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, this high-dose statin-induced reduction may explain inhibition of cell migration, sprouting, and healing responses culminating in premature vascular cell death.</p><p>Results from the immunocytochemical analysis of RMEC polarisation on the scratch wound migration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002584-g009">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002584-t002">Table 2</xref>) show a strong correlation between polarisation of the Golgi apparatus (73&#x00025;) and the MTOC (77&#x00025;) at the leading edge of non-treated RMECs. When treated with 0.01 &#x000b5;M simvastatin, again the Golgi complex and the MTOC similarly polarised to the leading edge (74&#x00025; and 86&#x00025; respectively), however 10 &#x000b5;M simvastatin interfered more with the Golgi polarisation which decreased by 71&#x00025; when compared to controls, while the MTOC polarisation only decreased by 38&#x00025;. This finding is important as it demonstrates that lowering intracellular cholesterol levels induces an abnormal Golgi complex polarisation in RMECs. It is well-known that the Golgi complex play an essential role in cholesterol transport from its origin in the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0002584-Ikonen1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>; therefore modulating cholesterol levels is more likely to affect the Golgi than the MTOC.</p><p>Our data indicate the existence of two distinct mechanisms of action for simvastatin on RMECs: the pro-vascular repair mechanism that involves VEGF stimulation, Akt phosphorylation and NO production, and the anti-vascular repair mechanism driven by intracellular cholesterol depletion and actin disorganisation. When simvastatin is used at low doses, the pro-reparative, angiogenic mechanism promotes vascular integrity. However, at high doses the cholesterol depletion is limiting, overwhelming any pro-vascular repair mechanism. This is consistent with the finding that mevalonate fully reversed cell death-induction by high-dose simvastatin, while it could, at best, only partially block pro-angiogenic effects.</p><p>In summary, low-dose simvastatin enhances retinal capillary endothelial cell survival, promotes healing responses and modulates angiogenic repair by reducing ischaemia and thereby preventing pre-retinal neovascularisation. High-dose simvastatin prevents reparative function and induces premature death of the retinal microvascular endothelium, which in vivo, translates into excessive ischaemia-induced neovascular pathology. We have not directly evaluated the effects of statins on the diabetic retina but many of the associated vascular pathologic endpoints have been investigated. More research is warranted but there is a clear indication that statin dosage should be judiciously monitored in patients who are diabetic or are at risk of developing other forms of proliferative retinopathy.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Primary RMECs were freshly prepared from bovine eyes according to standard isolation procedures previously described <xref rid="pone.0002584-Coleman1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. RMECs were cultured on 1&#x00025; gelatin coated flasks, with DMEM (PAA Labs GmbH, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10&#x00025; porcine serum (Sigma, Gillenham, UK), 100 &#x000b5;g/ml insulin (Sigma), 1 mg/ml heparin (Sigma), and 500 mg/ml Primocin (Autogen Bioclear Ltd, Wiltshire, UK). Passages 3 to 6 were used for experimentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Reagents</title><p>Reagents used were: Simvastatin Sodium Salt from Calbiochem (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), Mevalonate, farnesol, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate from Sigma.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Cell Proliferation and Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) Incorporation Assay</title><p>When RMECs monolayers were 50&#x00025; confluent, the total cell number per flask was assessed using an Improved Neubauer haemocytometer (Agar Scientific, Essex, UK) and simvastatin treatments started. After 48 hours, the number of cells per flask was counted, and the Population Doubling Level (PDL) was calculated.</p><p>For monitoring DNA synthesis, cells were pre-treated with 30 &#x000b5;M BrdU (Sigma) for 45 minutes prior to fixation in 99&#x00025; ethanol at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for 20 minutes. Microwave treatment in 10 mM Citrate buffer pH 6.0 was used to denature DNA for antigen retrieval, and cells were stained using monoclonal mouse anti-BrdU (DAKO UK Ltd, Cambridgeshire, UK) as primary antibody, and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK) as secondary antibody and visualised by a fluorescence microscope (Nikon).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Propidium Iodide (PI) Cell Death Assay and TUNEL Staining</title><p>Cell death was analysed 24 hours after simvastatin treatment. RMECs were harvested and fixed in ice cold 70&#x00025; ethanol. Cells were resuspended at 0.5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in staining buffer composed of 100 &#x000b5;g/ml RNase-A (Sigma), and 40 &#x000b5;g/ml PI (Sigma) in PBS, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. Cells were washed in PBS twice and analysed using a Flow Cytometer (FACScalibur, BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). Dead cells were detected on a PI histogram as a hypodiploid peak named sub-G1 population. Cell cycle analysis was performed on the same samples.</p><p>DNA fragmentation was visualized by TUNEL technology, using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Burgess Hill, UK) following manufacturer instructions. Briefly, after microwave treatment in 0.1 M Citrate buffer pH 6.0, DNA strand breaks were detected by 3&#x02032;-end labelling with fluorescein-dUTP using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Scratch Wound Assay</title><p>RMECs were grown on 1 cm wells previously labelled with traced lines in order to photograph the same regions. When cells were 90&#x00025; confluent, simvastatin treatment was started. After 24 hours, a uniform straight scratch was made in the monolayer using a 200 &#x000b5;l pipette tip. After injury, cells were gently washed, the medium was changed, and reference photographs were taken using a phase contrast microscope Eclipse E400 (Nikon, Japan). After 12 hours, photographs were again taken and the endothelial cell migration into the denuded area was quantified by comparing areas immediately after the scratch with the ones taken 12 hours later. Lucia software was used to measure areas in mm<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Angiogenic Sprouting and Tubulogenesis Assay</title><p>An <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenic sprouting assay was performed as previously described <xref rid="pone.0002584-Stitt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Briefly, 0.5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> RMECs were resuspended in 25 &#x000b5;l DMEM with respective simvastatin treatments, and mixed in a 1&#x02236;1 ratio with growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences). 50 &#x000b5;l aliquots were spotted onto 4 well plates (NUNC, Roskilde, Germany). After Matrigel polymerisation, blobs were covered in DMEM with 10&#x00025; porcine serum and different simvastatin concentrations. 24 hours later, medium was aspirated and a second layer of Matrigel was superimposed upon the primary spots creating duplex cultures which were covered with DMEM containing the respective simvastatin treatments. 36 hours after creating the duplex cultures, endothelial sprouts could be easily identified invading the secondary gel layer. The number of endothelial sprouts around the circumference of each spot was quantified in 6 cultures per treatment.</p><p>For the assessment of tube-like structures formation, 24 well-plates were coated with a basement membrane matrix preparation: growth factor-reduced Matrigel diluted 1&#x02236;2 in DMEM. RMECs were plated at a density of 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well and incubated in 0.01&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M simvastatin at 37&#x000b0;C for 3 days. 50 ng/ml VEGF (R&#x00026;D Systems, Abingdon, UK) was used as a positive control. To test whether simvastatin effects involved VEGF signalling, a VEGF neutralising Fab fragment ranibizumab (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) was used at a 1/50 dilution (200 &#x000b5;g/ml). Images were captured using a phase contrast microscope Eclipse E400 (Nikon).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>RMECs were fixed in 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature. After blocking with 5&#x00025; goat serum in PBS with 0.1&#x00025; Tween 20 for one hour at room temperature, cells were treated with a primary antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for one hour at room temperature, and observed on a Confocal Fluorescence Scanning Microscope (Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope fitted with a BioRad Microradiance Confocal imaging system equipped with argon-ion and green Helium-Neon lasers). Omission of the first antibodies consistently gave no signals confirming absence of non-specific binding of secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies used were anti-bovine &#x003b1;-tubulin (Molecular Probes), anti-golgin-97 (Molecular Probes) and caveolin-1 (BD Biosciences). Respective anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 IgGs were used as secondary antibodies. For labelling F-actin, the FITC-phalloidin probe (Molecular Probes) was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Oxygen-Induced Retinopathy Model</title><p>All experiments were performed in conformity to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, and UK Home Office Regulations. Oxygen-Induced Retinopathy (OIR) was induced in C57/Bl6 wild type mice according to the protocol of Smith et al <xref rid="pone.0002584-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Briefly, P7 newborn mice and their nursing dams were exposed to 75&#x00025; oxygen (Pro-Ox 110 Chamber Controller Used, Biospherix, Redfield, NY, USA) for 5 days. At P12, they were transferred back to room air cages. Hyperoxia exposure produces widespread vaso-obliteration in the central retinal capillary beds with profound ischaemic hypoxia upon return to room air. Around P15 the retinal ischaemia initiates an aggressive neovascular response at the interface of the perfused retinal periphery and the ischaemic central capillary beds. The neovascularisation is maximal at P17 and declines thereafter. 22 mice were divided into four groups: Group 1 with four pups as P12 controls to check the central vaso-obliteration following hyperoxia; Groups 2, 3, and 4 contained six pups each; Group 2 received daily intraperitoneal injections of a high dose of simvastatin (20 &#x000b5;g/g/day) for 6 days from P12 to P17; Group 3 received a low dose of simvastatin (0.2 &#x000b5;g/g/day) and Group 4 received no treatment. All intraperitoneal injection volumes were adjusted to 40&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;l. Pups from groups 2, 3, and 4 were killed at P18 with sodium pentobarbital; the eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde. Retinal flat mounts were stained with isolectin B4 (Sigma) and Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). Stained retinas were visualised and imaged using a fluorescence microscope and digital camera (Nikon Eclipse). Avascular, neovascularised, and normally vascularised retinal areas were quantified using Image J software.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Intracellular Cholesterol Quantification</title><p>To measure the intracellular cholesterol content of RMECs, the Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit (Molecular Probes) was used. After 24 hours exposure to different concentrations of simvastatin, RMECs were harvested, counted and 1 million cells per group were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer for later reaction with the Amplex Red Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fluorescence was measured by a Safire Microplate Reader (Tecan, Reading, UK) using excitation at 530 nm and emission detection at 590 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Western Blotting</title><p>Proteins from simvastatin treated-RMECs and controls were precipitated with 10&#x00025; trichloroacetic acid, and dissolved in 9 M urea (Sigma), 2 M thiourea (Sigma) and 4&#x00025; CHAPS (Melford Laboratories,Suffolk, UK). 20 &#x000b5;g of protein were loaded per lane and separated with Tris-HEPES-SDS polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and blocked with 5&#x00025; Blotto (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) in Tris Buffered Saline with 0.1&#x00025; Tween-20 (TBST). Total and phosphorylated Akt (Ser 473) were detected with polyclonal antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). After washing with TBST, respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were applied, and the blots were developed using the AutoChemi chemilumininescence imaging system (UVP, Upland, CA). PVDF membranes were re-probed with a monoclonal antibody to GAPDH (IMGENEX, San Diego, CA) as a loading control.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Electrochemical Detection of Nitric Oxide (NO) Production</title><p>Medium from 24 hour simvastatin-treated RMECs was collected and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. NO release was measured using a NO selective microelectrode (ami NO-700, Innovative Instruments Inc, Tampa, FL) and an amplifier inNO meter (Innovative Instruments Inc). Addition of 10 &#x000b5;l sample medium to a 0.1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution with 0.5&#x00025; KI converted the nitrite in the medium to NO, which was measured using the microelectrode that had been previously calibrated using sodium nitrite standards (250 nM to 3000 nM).
