Using the results of nine grazing experiments the paper shows that productivity is highly dependent on one leaf trait, leaf dry matter content, as well as rainfall. Animal (secondary) productivity is not dependent on plant functional diversity, but the variability in productivity of grasslands is related to the functional diversity of leaf dry matter content. This and a range of independent studies have shown that functional diversity is reduced at high levels of grassland productivity, so it appears that there is a trade-off between productivity and the resilience of productivity in the face of environmental variation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The research was supported by the Scottish Government's Rural and Environmental Research and Analysis Services Division.

In order to manage ecosystems to maintain the provision of ecosystem services for the long-term, we need to understand how various characteristics of plant communities contribute to controlling ecosystem processes. This approach has been formalized into analyzing the relative contributions of abiotic factors, plant traits and plant functional diversity to the rate of the process in question <xref rid="pone.0101876-Daz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Whilst many studies have shown the dependence of processes such as primary productivity and decomposition on plant traits <xref rid="pone.0101876-Cornwell1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0101876-Pakeman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, there has been less success in identifying the positive role of functional diversity in controlling ecosystem processes <xref rid="pone.0101876-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0101876-Schumacher1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> with even negative relationships having been found <xref rid="pone.0101876-Chanteloup1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This has, perhaps, been hampered by the search for suitable metrics of functional diversity <xref rid="pone.0101876-Mason1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Plant functional diversity could contribute to ecosystem processes in two ways. Functional diversity could contribute directly to the process rate <xref rid="pone.0101876-Daz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101876-Tilman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> (Hypothesis 1) or it could contribute to the resilience of ecosystem service supply, in this case animal production (Hypothesis 2) &#x02013; where resilience is defined as the capacity of a system to deliver services in the face of disturbance <xref rid="pone.0101876-Biggs1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101876-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, or in other words, reduce the variability of the process in question <xref rid="pone.0101876-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Resilience is necessary to sustain desirable ecosystem states in variable environments and uncertain futures <xref rid="pone.0101876-Elmqvist1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, as functional diversity is sensitive to land use intensification <xref rid="pone.0101876-Lalibert1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> then understanding its contribution to ecosystem services is a necessary step to enable the future long-term provision of services.</p><p>Many studies use ecosystem processes as surrogates for ecosystem services. This study instead, took a direct measure of an ecosystem service - livestock productivity from grasslands - measured as the density of livestock that can be stocked to achieve a set vegetation height. The data were derived from nine long-term grazing experiments <xref rid="pone.0101876-Pakeman2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> which had simultaneous measures of grazing density and vegetation data. Using weather data and trait data from databases, the influence of growing season weather, plant traits (as their community weighted mean) and plant functional diversity on production were tested. Functional diversity was calculated for a suite of response traits <xref rid="pone.0101876-Pakeman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and for individual leaf traits known to be linked to ecosystem function <xref rid="pone.0101876-Hodgson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101876-Qutier1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. There is no consensus on which measures of functional diversity may drive ecosystem function/services. Many functional metrics are highly correlated <xref rid="pone.0101876-Hodgson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, so to minimize the number of variables tested to reduce the risk of type one errors, only two orthogonal metrics were calculated: Rao's entropy (Q), which combines both functional richness and divergence, and the functional evenness (FEve) <xref rid="pone.0101876-Mouchet1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Two alternate hypotheses were tested: (1) that functional diversity contributes directly to ecosystem service delivery, and (2) that functional diversity confers resilience (the capacity of the system to deliver the service in the face of changing conditions) to ecosystem services through the presence of alternative trait combinations that can exploit the variance in environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>The results of nine previously published experiments investigating the interactions between livestock grazing and the dynamics of grass-dominated vegetation were assembled. These were the same as those analyzed in <xref rid="pone.0101876-Pakeman2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, except for one experiment (Bell Hill, <xref rid="pone.0101876-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>) for which the management data were not complete. Data were available for between 4 and 15 years depending on experiment and consisted of vegetation records (point quadrat data) and productivity data in terms of the number of days of grazing required to keep the vegetation at a set height - this equates to secondary production. Data were taken just from the control (continuation of previous site management) treatments so the data were not confounded by changing grazing intensities and were converted to livestock units (LU) ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to account for the different species of grazers in the different experiments <xref rid="pone.0101876-European1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The data are available from the author. Trait data were assembled from standard sources <xref rid="pone.0101876-Kleyer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101876-KlotzSKhn1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> but were restricted to the main response traits in grassland vegetation <xref rid="pone.0101876-Pakeman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0101876-t001">Table 1</xref>). Data for numeric traits were usually averaged from many entries in the databases; mean values for each species were calculated by a weighted mean of all the entries, where the weight was represented by the replication used to produce each entry. Using trait information sourced from databases meant that species values were fixed both within and between sites, so changes in the values of numeric traits between years depends upon changes in abundance only. The trait and vegetation data were used to calculate the following functional diversity measures for the full set of response traits and for the two individual leaf traits SLA and LDMC: community weighted mean (CWM), and two orthogonal measures of functional diversity - functional evenness (FEve) and Rao's Q <xref rid="pone.0101876-Lalibert1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The two vegetative regeneration attributes were each given a weight of 0.5 to ensure the overall weight of this trait was the same as for the others. Weather data were assembled from the UKCP09 5 km&#x000d7;5 km gridded data available for each month <xref rid="pone.0101876-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. For each site the growing season's mean temperature and total rainfall were calculated for the period May to September, as this was the period over which the grazing ran for all experiments.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0101876-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0101876.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Traits used in the analysis with source and coding information.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0101876-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0101876.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Traits</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Coding</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Attributes</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bud height (life-form) <sup>(*)</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Geophyte, Therophyte</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.333</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemicryptophyte</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.667</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chamaephyte</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phanerophyte</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">log Canopy height (m) <sup>(&#x02020;)</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">continuous</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Canopy structure<sup>(*)</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rosette</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemirosette</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Erosulate</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flowering -

Hypothesis 0 corresponds to following stages 1 and 2 of (2) and then linking them together as it is already understood that productivity is frequently dependent on both weather <xref rid="pone.0101876-Freckleton1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and on the functional characteristics of the vegetation <xref rid="pone.0101876-Garnier1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Hypothesis 1 follows their steps 3 and 5: identifying possible functional diversity measures related to productivity and then the most parsimonious model of productivity from the combination of trait, weather and functional diversity previously identified as correlated to the ecosystem process of interest.</p><p>Developing the models through simplification from a full model was not possible due to the number of potential alternatives. Instead, Hypothesis 0 was addressed by finding the combination of weather and traits that best explained the productivity of the vegetation starting from a fixed model of the best response trait (this was highly correlated to the other significant response traits 0.554 to 0.946, and fitting them subsequently to the best leaf trait did not offer significant explanatory power) and all the climate variables <xref rid="pone.0101876-Crawley1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101876-Zuur1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. A squared term was added for yearly rainfall as a result of data exploration. Leaf dry matter content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101876-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>) showed an exponential decay.

The eventual random model used was 1|experiment/plot. The fixed model was then simplified by comparing likelihood ratios and AIC values from progressive removal of terms. Models were fitted using the <italic>nmle</italic> package <xref rid="pone.0101876-Pinheiro1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> in <italic>R</italic> (R Development Core Team 2010) using maximum likelihood for fixed model comparisons, and residual maximum likelihood for random model comparisons and final estimations of model parameters.

The choice of LDMC over SLA as a measure of productivity is in contrast to many studies <xref rid="pone.0101876-Garnier1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101876-Poorter1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, but aligns with some <xref rid="pone.0101876-Hodgson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101876-Klumpp1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. LDMC is a good measure of investment in leaf structural tissue and its inverse is hence a good measure of digestibility <xref rid="pone.0101876-Duru1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Substituting LDMC by other traits such as leaf nitrogen content could be even more effective. However, the availability of this data was not as complete as for LDMC for this analysis. Identifying good predictors of ecosystem processes and services, such as here, provides the opportunity to map ecosystem services based on vegetation information <xref rid="pone.0101876-Lavorel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, for instance to highlight areas of high value, and to analyze the trade-offs in service supply that would occur as a result of land use change <xref rid="pone.0101876-Lavorel2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. As LDMC appears sensitive to average rainfall at both a specific <xref rid="pone.0101876-Pakeman3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and community level <xref rid="pone.0101876-Pakeman4" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, the small additional explanatory power that rainfall makes to a model fitted with LDMC alone is as expected. Rainfall here explained inter-annual variation in production whilst LDMC is explained by the climate (as well as soil) driven variation.</p><p>Functional diversity was not helpful in explaining the productivity of the grasslands analyzed. Thus this study does not add evidence either way to the role of functional diversity in contributing to productivity <xref rid="pone.0101876-Mouillot1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101876-Roscher1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> or restricting it <xref rid="pone.0101876-Chanteloup1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The marginally significant negative relationships (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101876.s002">Table S2</xref>) were, however, more in line with the latter &#x02013; as with an increase in the variance of traits present there has to be an increase in the absolute distances between species traits present and the to the optimum trait value for those specific conditions of site and weather combined. In line with other studies <xref rid="pone.0101876-Flynn2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101876-Lalibert2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, functional diversity was reduced at high land use intensity, as was the functional diversity of leaf dry matter content. However, here there was evidence that functional diversity, as the richness/divergence measure Rao's Q of LDMC, was correlated to the size of the residuals from the model containing LDMC and rainfall. At high functional diversity the grasslands appeared to be more statistically predictable in their productivity, suggesting a higher resilience to environmental variability. This may explain the patterns seen in other studies where species diversity was correlated to resilience in production <xref rid="pone.0101876-Polley1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>; species diversity was likely a surrogate for functional diversity. However, meta-analysis has shown that the stability of service delivery varies between the type of stressor, and the pattern shown here in response to weather may not be similar in response to other disturbances <xref rid="pone.0101876-Balvanera1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> The relationship identified here was relatively weak, but it was present after accounting for the fitting of LDMC and rainfall, and a range of other factors will have contributed to the unexplained variation, including intra-annual variability in the weather.</p><p>From the data analyzed here it appears that functional diversity, a key component of biodiversity, is contributing to the sustainability of grassland production systems through increased resilience and predictability of outputs. Managing for high production may result in reduced the statistical predictability of production <xref rid="pone.0101876-Marriott1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> as well as reducing biodiversity <xref rid="pone.0101876-Adler1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101876-Isbell1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Consequently, there appears to be a trade-off between productivity and resilience of production that is mediated via the functional diversity and functional identity of the plant community.
