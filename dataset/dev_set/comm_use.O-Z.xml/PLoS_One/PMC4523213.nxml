RSV infection involving the upper airway may progress to lower respiratory tract disease, which is associated with recurrent wheezing and asthma in childhood[<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and significantly increases health resource utilization[<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In Canada, Langley et al. estimated that RSV-associated illness costs US$18 million annually, with inpatient hospital care and ambulatory expenditure as being the top contributors[<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Palivizumab has been studied extensively in children who are at-risk for RSV-related hospitalizations, and has been shown to significantly reduce both the incidence of hospitalizations and duration of hospital stay [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Palivizumab is a composite monoclonal antibody with 95% human and 5% murine amino acid sequences and a molecular weight of approximately 148,000 Daltons[<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Despite humanization and the minimal homology with the mouse antibody, palivizumab still has immunogenic potential and can induce anti-palivizumab antibodies, which could alter its therapeutic efficacy and incite hypersensitivity reactions [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In 2002, the manufacturer of palivizumab reported an incidence of 2 anaphylactic cases in an estimated population of 400,000 patients (&#x0003c;1 per 100,000 patients) based on four seasons of world-wide post-marketing data [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While those data are reassuring, the numerator relies on voluntary reports submitted to a passive surveillance system, which may lead to an underestimation of adverse events (AE), and the denominator is approximated. AEs associated with palivizumab were also assessed as part of the Phase I-III clinical trials [12&#x02013;13, 22&#x02013;24] and in follow-up studies [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, sample sizes in those studies were too small to detect rare events and the populations under surveillance may not reflect real world outcomes in other at-risk infants who receive prophylaxis (e.g., neuromuscular impairments, immunocompromise and cystic fibrosis) [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although overall mortality was previously reported by Mitchell et al, it was assessed in a smaller sample of subjects who had received palivizumab without an in-depth analysis of the documented AEs [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As such, data are lacking on the incidence and characteristics of serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with palivizumab.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to describe SAEs in children recruited into the Canadian RSV Evaluation Study of Palivizumab (CARESS) database, who received palivizumab during the 2008&#x02013;2013 RSV seasons. The secondary aim was to examine if any demographic risk factors were associated with an SAE occurrence. In addition, palivizumab discontinuations were assessed to quantify tolerability and evaluate whether SAEs were associated with termination of prophylaxis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Palivizumab Administration</title><p>Palivizumab is injected intramuscularly at a dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight. An interval of 16&#x02013;35 days between the first and second injection and 25&#x02013;35 days for subsequent injections has been adopted provincially across Canada in order to target appropriate therapeutic serum palivizumab levels for RSV prevention. Patients are expected to receive an injection on a monthly basis from the time of enrolment to the end of the RSV season which averages 4 to 5 injections per season dependent on when the first palivizumab injection was administered [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The length of the RSV season is site-specific and the starting date is determined by local clinicians, based on historic patterns of RSV epidemiology and community based rates of infection. Similarly the season offset is also determined by local clinicians usually after 2 consecutive 7-day periods with 1 or no RSV hospital admissions [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Canadian RSV Evaluation Study of Palivizumab (CARESS)</title><p>CARESS is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, open-cohort study of pediatric patients, who received at least one injection of palivizumab across 32 Canadian sites during any of the RSV seasons from 2008 to 2013. Written, informed consent is obtained from parents or legal guardians before patients are enrolled into the study. An electronic case report form is used for all stages of data collection to ensure consistency. Information regarding demographics, medical history, neonatal course, and palivizumab administration is collected at enrolment. Subsequent monthly interviews are conducted by research nurses beginning when consent is obtained, each occurring within 4 weeks of the previous palivizumab injection. The interviews are conducted until 30 days after the patient&#x02019;s last injection. In these monthly interviews, data on: palivizumab administration, changes in baseline data, hospitalization for respiratory illness (RIH), diagnostic tests for RSV-related infection, reasons attributing to the discontinuation of palivizumab, and clinical evidence of AEs are collected from the patients&#x02019; parents or guardian. In the event of a RIH, with additional parental/legal guardian consent, the research nurse reviews the relevant hospital records and completes a corresponding hospitalization form.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of subjects by study nurses at each site.

Treatment-emergent AEs refer to events that appeared after palivizumab administration or worsened relative to the pre-treatment state, before causality is considered. The treatment-related concept was employed to control for the substantial background influence of symptoms, caused as a result of underlying medical conditions that were unrelated to palivizumab [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The AE qualified as a serious adverse event (SAE) if it involved: death, a life-threatening event, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospital stay, persistent or significant disability or incapacity of the subject, or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>All treatment-emergent AEs that met the criteria of a SAE were submitted to the principal and coordinating investigators within 24 hours of occurrence, using a standardized form. The SAE form was adapted from Health Canada&#x02019;s AE guidelines to include date of onset, duration, description, severity, outcome, relationship to palivizumab and final diagnosis. The intensity of each event was additionally sub-classified as mild, moderate or severe (<xref rid="pone.0134711.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). A mild event was defined as being transient and easily tolerated; moderate as one causing discomfort with interruption of usual activities and severe as an event with significant interference which may be life-threatening [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0134711.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0134711.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flow diagram of the assessment of adverse events.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0134711.g001"/></fig><p>Upon receipt of a SAE form, the principal investigators of the study, independent of the site investigator, verified the assessment of the relationship of the SAE to palivizumab. <xref rid="pone.0134711.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, summarizes how an adverse event was assessed. The principal investigators assessed the SAE&#x02019;s relationship to palivizumab using the following definitions: probably related, had a strong temporal relationship to palivizumab administration or recurred on re-challenge and an alternative etiology was far less likely; possibly related, had a strong temporal relationship to palivizumab administration and an alternative etiology was equally or less likely; probably not related, little or no temporal relationship to paliviumab administration or an alternative etiology was more likely; and not related, the event was due to an underlying illness or effect of another drug and was not related to palivizumab (no temporal relationship or more likely alternative etiology exists) [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

Local investigators at each site and subsequently the principal investigators assessed the submitted SAEs and agreed on the same ratings. Forty-four events in 42 patients were categorized as probably not related or not related. Among the 42 patients, 17 had both an unrelated SAE and a RIH.

In four patients, the adverse events had multiple recurrences upon re-challenge with palivizumab, and the remaining two patients had a single SAE. Each of the six patients experienced possible hypersensitivity reactions as verified by the site investigators: 10 events in 3 patients were assessed to be &#x0201c;possibly related&#x0201d; to palivizumab and 4 events in 3 infants were &#x0201c;probably related&#x0201d;. These AEs were verified by the Naranjo scale, with the SAEs of 3 patients categorized as &#x0201c;possibly related&#x0201d; and the SAEs of the other 3 categorized as &#x0201c;probably related&#x0201d; to palivizumab administration. Details of each patient are summarized in <xref rid="pone.0134711.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.

All the events resolved after monitoring for 30 days with no immediate life-threatening consequences (<xref rid="pone.0134711.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Two patients were hospitalized: Case 1 was seen in the ER for the first event and was maintained in hospital for 1 day, and Case 4 was admitted for 2 days for monitoring with resolution of the clinical state. The remaining events were categorized as &#x0201c;medically important&#x0201d;. In terms of onset, three of 6 patients had adverse reactions after the first injection (<xref rid="pone.0134711.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

We were not able to detect any demographic risk factors that were significantly associated with palivizumab-related SAEs. This may either be due to the relatively small number of SAEs related to palivizumab or the idiosyncratic nature of these reactions. The overall number of SAEs found in this cohort was low, but comparable to rates noted in previous studies[<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the majority of which evaluated infants who met regulatory approved indications for prophylaxis universally. Our study is unique, because it also encompasses the largest group of infants (n = 2381, 18.3%) with complex medical disorders who may have a higher risk of SAEs [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] that may result in serious respiratory-related hospitalizations and RSV associated mortality.</p><p>The multicenter phase III-IV Expanded Access trial noted that 39 out of 565 patients, who were premature (&#x02264;35 weeks gestation) or who were aged &#x0003c;2 years with chronic lung disease, sustained a total of 40 palivizumab-related adverse events. None were severe, 7 (18%) were moderate and 33 (82%) were mild. Few patients (1.9%) withdrew from the study due to adverse events, and 3 out of the 11 withdrawals (27.3%) were due to possibly or probably palivizumab-related adverse events[<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similarly, none of the CARESS patients experienced a severe palivizumab-related SAE, although 4 (67%) were categorized as moderate and 2 (33%) were mild. Six of the 20 (30%) withdrawals identified in the CARESS registry were possibly related to palivizumab.</p><p>In this study, the majority of SAEs deemed possibly or probably related to palivizumab were hypersensitivity reactions. Monoclonal antibodies such as palivizumab are known to have immunogenic potential and may induce anti-palivizumab antibodies. Initial exposure to the monoclonal antibody sensitizes IgE, which may result in hypersensitivity reactions caused by the IgE-mediated release of inflammatory mediators upon subsequent dosage [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In CARESS, three patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions following previous exposure to palivizumab. In particular, one of the three patients reacted following the second injection of their second season of palivizumab therapy, but had no such occurrence in the first season. Lacaze-Masmonteil et al. investigated whether or not there is an increased occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions during the second season of palivizumab and concluded that there were no significant differences compared to the first season, but the sample size was relatively small [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This is reflected in our results as the SAEs in the remaining half of the cases (n = 3) occurred following the first injection.</p><p>In another study, Lacaze-Masmonteil et al. described 15 adverse events among 516 children that were potentially related to palivizumab administration [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While the seriousness of events was not assessed, they were reported as: apnea, fever, injection site pain, hyperventilation, asthenia, vomiting, bronchitis, worsening cough, and urticaria. The symptoms are similar in character to those reported in CARESS, such as erythema, vomiting, nasal congestion, and bronchospasm.</p><p>No significant demographic differences (family history of atopy, maternal smoking and smoking during pregnancy, or exposure to smoking in the home) were found between patients who experienced possibly or probably related SAEs and the rest of the subjects in the database. However, this may be due to insufficient analytic power to detect such differences in a small number (n = 6) of patients.</p><p>Moore et al. noted that palivizumab accounted for 15% (113/769) of reported deaths to the FDA within a 38 month study period (Nov 1997-Dec 2000), and that palivizumab was suspected in 28% of the cases to be associated with a serious or fatal adverse event [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, a re-analysis of the data by Geskey et al. confirmed that only 2% of the recorded 133 deaths associated with palivizumab occurred in full-term infants without congenital anomalies, and the increased risk of death in the rest of the children was likely due to other causes, rather than palivizumab [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similar relationships with deaths were noted in the CARESS database, and none of the deaths were related to RSV infection. The majority occurred in patients with serious pre-existing medical disorders which likely contributed to their mortality.</p><p>There are some limitations of this study. First, for older infants, the CARESS registry does not link patients in their first season of palivizumab therapy to those in subsequent seasons, because patients are allocated new identification numbers every year, which align with privacy recommendations. Information on previous administration would be useful as patients receiving palivizumab could develop an immune response to the monoclonal antibody [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, this limitation applied only to one case possibly-related to palivizumab, where the child was reported to have received palivizumab injections in the previous year without adverse experiences. Second, patients with possible or probable palivizumab-related SAEs were not tested for anti-palivizumab antibodies. Instead, causality assessment relied strictly on patient history, timing of the event, de-challenge and re-challenge clinically. Thus, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether SAEs that resulted in RSV-positive hospitalizations were either due to reduced efficacy of palivizumab (anti-idiotypic response [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) or defined immunological reactions caused by anti-palivizumab anti-bodies binding to palivizumab. The development of anti-palivizumab antibodies secondary to hypersensitivity reactions can lead to a substantial decrease in the serum concentration of palivizumab. Therefore, some RSV-positive hospitalizations may be attributed to the sub-optimal therapeutic effect of palivizumab, resulting in an underestimated incidence of SAEs deemed related or possibly related to palivizumab. In previous studies[<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], significant anti-palivizumab antibody titres consistently &#x0003e;1:80 were not observed and none of the antibody titres reduced the mean, trough palivizumab serum concentrations to below target, inhibitory RSV levels[<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Similarly, in a recent systematic review, Wegzyn et al. reported an overall low incidence of anti-palivizumab antibodies in patients born prematurely, and those with BPD and HSCHD [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Third, there were incomplete data for the 4 patients who were re-challenged with palivizumab after their initial reaction with the injection. While two patients did not appear to have increased severity in their reactions, the other two cases reported increased and prolonged vomiting and nasal congestion after each injection; the most severe reactions were reported after the fourth and last dose with vomiting occurring approximately 48 hours after the injection. These 4 patients all discontinued prophylaxis after the parents and treating physician discussed a possible relationship between the events and palivizumab. However, no diagnostic tests were done to quantify the level of anti-palivizumab antibodies or serum palivizumab concentrations following these reactions.</p><p>The CARESS registry does not include a placebo arm, so it is difficult to assess if infants receiving palivizumab had significantly different rates of SAEs compared to a placebo. In the IMpact-RSV randomized controlled trial in infants with congenital heart disease, no significant differences in the number of reported AEs between placebo and palivizumab were detected by the blinded investigators [<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134711.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Immunogenicity studies conducted in the IMpact trial documented that 0.7% of the palivizumab recipients had anti-palivizumab antibodies following the fourth injection, compared to 1.1% found in the placebo group[<xref rid="pone.0134711.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, although data were collected prospectively by interviewing parents and guardians of the patient, it is often difficult to obtain complete and accurate data. To minimize the impact of this limitation, measures such as cross-referencing findings with patients&#x02019; hospital charts was undertaken with patient consent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Under active surveillance, a very small proportion of infants who received RSV prophylaxis in the CARESS registry experienced SAEs that were likely linked to palivizumab. These SAEs appeared to be idiosyncratic and were not significantly associated with demographic and environmental risk factors for RSV-related infection. Overall, palivizumab appears to be a safe and well-tolerated prophylaxis for infants at risk of RSV infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134711.s001"><label>S1 Form</label><caption><title>Hospitalization form in the event of a hospitalization associated with respiratory illness.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134711.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Hao Yi for her assistance with compiling the data.
