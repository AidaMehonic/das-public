We tested whether administering an inflammatory cytokine, recombinant bovine tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (rbTNF&#x003b1;), affects milk production, metabolism, and health during this period. Thirty-three Holstein cows (9 primiparous and 24 multiparous) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments at parturition. Treatments were 0 (Control), 1.5, or 3.0 &#x000b5;g/kg body weight rbTNF&#x003b1;, which were administered once daily by subcutaneous injection for the first 7 days of lactation. Statistical contrasts were used to evaluate the treatment and dose effects of rbTNF&#x003b1; administration. Plasma TNF&#x003b1; concentrations at 16 h post-administration tended to be increased (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.10) by rbTNF&#x003b1; administration, but no dose effect (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.10) was detected; rbTNF&#x003b1; treatments increased (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) concentrations of plasma haptoglobin. Most plasma eicosanoids were not affected (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.10) by rbTNF&#x003b1; administration, but 6 out of 16 measured eicosanoids changed (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) over the first week of lactation, reflecting elevated inflammatory mediators in the days immediately following parturition. Dry matter and water intake, milk yield, and milk fat and protein yields were all decreased (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) by rbTNF&#x003b1; treatments by 15 to 18%. Concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin, &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified fatty acids, triglyceride, 3-methylhistidine, and liver triglyceride were unaffected (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.10) by rbTNF&#x003b1; treatment. Glucose turnover rate was unaffected (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.18) by rbTNF&#x003b1; administration. The higher dose of rbTNF&#x003b1; tended to increase the risk of cows developing one or more health disorders (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.08). Taken together, these results indicate that administration of rbTNF&#x003b1; daily for the first 7 days of lactation altered inflammatory responses, impaired milk production and health, but did not significantly affect liver triglyceride accumulation or nutrient metabolism in dairy cows.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was partially funded by Elanco Animal Health.

In response to these changes, dairy cows mobilize adipose tissue triglyceride (TG), leading to elevated non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations in the blood. The high flux of blood NEFA to the liver often exceeds the capacity of the liver to completely oxidize NEFA to CO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in partial oxidation to form ketones or esterification to form TG within hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Grummer2">[2]</xref>. Excessive production of ketones often leads to ketosis, which is characterized by elevated blood concentrations of &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), depressed appetite, and decreased milk production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Oetzel1">[3]</xref>. Furthermore, because ruminants are inefficient at exporting TG from the liver, excessive TG accumulation or fatty liver occurs. Ketosis and fatty liver affect up to 50% of dairy cows, compromising production, health, and reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Oetzel1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Bobe1">[4]</xref>. Gluconeogenesis is of great importance at all times in ruminants, providing up to 90% of the necessary glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Young1">[5]</xref>. Meeting glucose needs can be a tremendous metabolic challenge for early-lactation dairy cows, which often experience inadequate feed intake. Although lipid and glucose metabolism in periparturient cows has been extensively studied, the mechanisms underlying the development of these metabolic disorders are not fully understood.</p><p>Inflammatory mediators play critical roles in immunity and metabolism, and recent research has suggested that inflammation is involved in metabolic disorders as well. For example, obesity is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammatory state in multiple metabolic tissues including adipose, liver, muscle, pancreas, and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Gregor1">[6]</xref>. Compared with lean controls, obese mice had increased levels of adipose tissue tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;), a potent cytokine capable of triggering inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Hotamisligil1">[7]</xref>. In dairy cows, fatty liver was associated with increased plasma inflammation markers, including haptoglobin and serum amyloid A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Ametaj1">[8]</xref>. Although a recent study reported that plasma concentrations of TNF&#x003b1; in periparturient cows were decreased postpartum compared with prepartum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Schoenberg1">[9]</xref>, elevated activity of serum TNF&#x003b1; was observed in cows with moderate to severe fatty liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Ohtsuka1">[10]</xref>. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that chronic low-grade inflammation may be a mechanism underlying bovine fatty liver. In fact, we found that low-level administration of the recombinant bovine TNF&#x003b1; (rbTNF&#x003b1;) for 7 d promoted liver inflammation and TG accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Bradford1">[11]</xref>. However, late-lactation animals were used in that work, and it is unclear if this model is applicable to cows in the first week of lactation, when fatty liver naturally occurs. Beyond direct promotion of fatty liver, hepatic inflammation may also affect glucose production. Bradford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Bradford1">[11]</xref> reported that rbTNF&#x003b1; administration reduced liver gluconeogenic gene expression in late-lactation cows. If inflammatory cytokines impair glucose production in early-lactation animals, the resulting hypoglycemia would likely increase adipose TG mobilization and metabolic disorders.</p><p>We hypothesized that metabolic stress in early-lactation cows is exacerbated by inflammatory challenge, thereby adversely affecting production and health. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether exogenous rbTNF&#x003b1; administration promotes inflammation and TG accumulation, impairs gluconeogenesis, alters lipid metabolism, and affects milk production and health status in early-lactation dairy cows. A greater understanding of the pathological impact of inflammatory pathways in these animals may improve our ability to prevent metabolic disorders and increase production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The Kansas State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental procedures.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and Treatments</title><p>A recombinant expression vector encoding the secreted form of bovine TNF&#x003b1; (Entrez Protein Accession AAB84086.1, region 77&#x02013;233) was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified by a commercial laboratory (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ).

Each cow received approximately 1 g of U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose in 50 mL of sterile saline; syringes were weighed immediately before and after infusion to determine the exact amount administered. Catheters were flushed with a sterile solution of 3.5% sodium citrate after the labeled glucose bolus (20 mL) and after each blood sample collection (5 mL). Plasma glucose concentration was quantified to verify that steady-state conditions were met.</p><p>Plasma samples collected for the glucose turnover assay were analyzed for U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose enrichment (Metabolic Solutions, Inc., Nashua, NH). Glucose was extracted and converted to aldonitrile pentaacetate derivative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Tserng1">[18]</xref>, and negative chemical ionization GC/MS (Hewlett-Packard 5890; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used to analyze derivatized samples. The isotopic composition of the glucose was determined by monitoring unlabeled (M+0: m/z&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;328) versus U-<sup>13</sup>C-labeled (M+6: m/z&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;334) glucose derivatives. This approach, as opposed to oxidation of glucose and measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, ensures that results are not biased by carbon recycling via the Cori cycle. Turnover rate of plasma glucose was calculated from the disappearance curve for U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose. Enrichment of plasma glucose for each animal was fitted to an exponential decay curve according to the following equation: E<sub>t</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;E<sub>0</sub>&#x000d7; e<sup>&#x02212;kt</sup>, where t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;time relative to infusion (min), E<sub>t</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;enrichment of plasma glucose (U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose: unlabeled glucose ratio) at time t, E<sub>0</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;enrichment at time t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0, and k&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;rate constant (min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). After using the best-fit equations to determine k and E<sub>0</sub>, the total glucose pool was calculated by the following equation: G&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;M&#x000f7;E<sub>0</sub>, where G&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;total glucose pool (g) and M&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;mass of tracer infused (g). Plasma glucose turnover rate (GTR, g/min) was calculated according to the equation GTR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;G&#x000d7;k. Samples collected 10 min prior to infusion of U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose were also analyzed to verify the lack of natural occurrence of the M+6 isotopomer.</p></sec><sec id="s2b5"><title>Liver TG</title><p>At the end of treatment d 7, liver samples were collected by percutaneous biopsy as described by Morey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Morey1">[19]</xref>.

Therefore, in the present study, we administered 1.5 and 3 &#x000b5;g/kg rbTNF&#x003b1; in an attempt to characterize a similar low-grade inflammation in early-lactation cows, which experience dramatic energy demands of milk production and tremendous metabolic stress compared with late-lactation animals. Although blood samples were collected 16 h after the previous injection, we still observed a tendency for elevated plasma TNF&#x003b1; concentrations in treated cows, indicating a sustained chronic inflammation status in cows receiving rbTNF&#x003b1;. Moreover, 3 &#x000b5;g/kg rbTNF&#x003b1; administration increased hepatic transcript abundance of <italic>TNF&#x003b1;</italic>, further supporting that treatment enhanced pro-inflammatory responses.</p><p>We also evaluated plasma concentrations of haptoglobin and eicosanoids, and the protein abundance of key inflammatory mediators in the liver. Haptoglobin is an acute phase protein primarily released by the liver in inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Hachenberg1">[24]</xref>. Our finding that rbTNF&#x003b1; increased haptoglobin agrees with a previous study that daily administration of 2.5 &#x000b5;g/kg rbTNF&#x003b1; for 7 d dramatically elevated plasma haptoglobin in lactating cows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Kushibiki1">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, haptoglobin elevation has been associated with bovine fatty liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Bobe1">[4]</xref>, suggesting that liver TG accumulation may be associated with inflammation. However, recent research indicated that excess NEFA influx to the liver, rather than hepatic TG accumulation <italic>per se</italic>, causes liver damage through promoting lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-NeuschwanderTetri1">[26]</xref>. In the present study, neither NEFA nor liver TG were affected by treatments, suggesting that rbTNF&#x003b1; increased haptoglobin independent of altered lipid mobilization.</p><p>Eicosanoids are a family of signaling molecules produced by oxidation of 20-carbon essential fatty acids. They exert complex control over inflammation, and can either enhance (such as certain types of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes) or resolve (such as resolvins, protectins, and maresins) inflammatory responses depending on their types and the timing of production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Sordillo1">[27]</xref>. The increased lipolysis and elevated plasma NEFA in early lactation may increase the supply of fatty acid substrates for eicosanoid production, thereby affecting the duration and magnitude of inflammation. In the present study, 6 out of the 16 measured plasma eicosanoids were significantly altered over time, but few treatment effects were detected for eicosanoids. One interesting finding was that the highest dose of rbTNF&#x003b1; tended to suppress the anti-inflammatory eicosanoid class, primarily reflecting decreased concentrations of 7-maresin 1, protectin, and 9-oxoODE. We are unaware of evidence in the literature of cytokines inhibiting release of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, but such an effect is consistent with the pro-inflammatory effects of TNF&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Hotamisligil1">[7]</xref>. We cannot rule out the possibility that decreases in anti-inflammatory eicosanoids may have been driven by an unknown mediator rather than a direct effect of TNF&#x003b1;. Still, it is intriguing that rbTNF&#x003b1; administration apparently did more to suppress the production of resolving lipid mediators than to enhance the production of inflammatory lipids, and this result should inform choices about measures of interest in future studies.</p><p>We found that concentrations of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, including certain types of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, were elevated around parturition and decreased during the first week of lactation, whereas pro-resolving metabolites, such as resolvin D<sub>2</sub> and 7-maresin 1, increased after parturition. Consistent with the results of the above-mentioned eicosanoids, the composite pro-inflammatory class was elevated at parturition and decreased thereafter, whereas the anti-inflammatory class changed in the opposite direction. Although the inflammatory state of postpartum dairy cows has been well documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Bionaz1">[28]</xref>, these are the first data to document an increase in anti-inflammatory eicosanoids during the resolution of inflammation as lactation proceeds. The causative role of eicosanoids in this resolution phase should be a fruitful area for further investigation.</p><p>Nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) is a key transcription factor that plays crucial roles in inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Karin1">[29]</xref>. In nonstimulated cells, NF-&#x003ba;B is bound to inhibitory I&#x003ba;B proteins and sequestered in the cytoplasm. Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B primarily occurs via the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of I&#x003ba;B proteins; subsequently, the liberated NF-&#x003ba;B is translocated to the nucleus to drive expression of inflammatory genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Hcker1">[30]</xref>. One of the major I&#x003ba;B proteins in inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B activation is I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, the abundance of which can be used to estimate anti-inflammatory status. In this study, hepatic I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; abundance was significantly increased by rbTNF&#x003b1; in primiparous cows. This observation is unexpected, because TNF&#x003b1; is a potent activator of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Karin1">[29]</xref>, and suggests the involvement of compensatory anti-inflammatory adaptations in response to rbTNF&#x003b1;.</p><p>We also investigated the inflammatory mediator c-Jun, which is a key component of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor activator protein-1. The transcriptional activity of c-Jun is increased by phosphorylation of serine residues in response to various stimuli, including inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Lee1">[31]</xref>. As for the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, we found no evidence of hepatic c-Jun activation in response to rbTNF&#x003b1;. Collectively, rbTNF&#x003b1; treatment did not significantly alter the hepatic protein abundance of inflammatory mediators, but nevertheless greatly increased the plasma concentration of haptoglobin, an acute phase protein induced primarily by inflammatory signals in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-NakagawaTosa1">[32]</xref>. It is possible that haptoglobin was primarily induced by transcription factors other than NF-&#x003ba;B or activator protein-1.</p><p>In this study, feed intake and milk production were decreased by rbTNF&#x003b1; treatments by 18 and 15%, respectively. TNF&#x003b1; is a key mediator causing anorexigenic responses in various diseases, and many of the effects of TNF&#x003b1; are dependent on its actions in the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Romanatto1">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, our previous research in late-lactation cows showed that 2 &#x000b5;g/kg rbTNF&#x003b1; treatment daily for 7 d also decreased feed intake by 18%, but did not significantly alter milk production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Bradford1">[11]</xref>. Kushibiki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Kushibiki1">[25]</xref> reported that daily administration of 2.5 &#x000b5;g/kg rbTNF&#x003b1; for 7 d dramatically decreased feed intake (by &#x0223c;34%) and milk yield (by &#x0223c;15%). As expected, cows were in negative energy balance during the immediate postpartum period, indicating that their energy expenditure, driven largely by lactation requirements, greatly exceeded their energy intake. However, energy balance values were not affected by rbTNF&#x003b1; administration because the magnitude of decreased milk production was comparable to that of decreased feed intake.</p><p>Administration of rbTNF&#x003b1; did not alter plasma markers of lipid metabolism or promote fatty liver. As a lipolytic mediator in adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Zhang1">[34]</xref>, previous studies found that rbTNF&#x003b1; administration at 2.5 &#x000b5;g/kg significantly increased plasma NEFA concentrations in mid-lactation cows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Kushibiki1">[25]</xref> and heifers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Kushibiki2">[35]</xref>. We also previously reported that 7-d rbTNF&#x003b1; administration at 2 &#x000b5;g/kg daily increased liver TG by &#x0223c;2-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Bradford1">[11]</xref>. It is possible that because plasma NEFA and BHBA concentrations, as well as liver TG content, were already dramatically elevated in response to negative energy balance in the periparturient period, the doses of rbTNF&#x003b1; used in this study were insufficient to promote further alterations in lipid metabolism. On the transcriptional level, our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Bradford1">[11]</xref> in late-lactation cows showed that 2 &#x000b5;g/kg rbTNF&#x003b1; administration daily for 7 d increased the transcript abundance of <italic>AGPAT1</italic> (which catalyzes the esterification of a fatty acyl-CoA to the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone in TG synthesis), tended to decrease <italic>CPT1a</italic> (which catalyzes transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidation), and did not affect <italic>ApoB</italic> (which is a key component of very low-density lipoprotein that mediates hepatic TG exportation). Here, we did not find treatment effects for <italic>AGPAT1</italic> or <italic>ApoB</italic>, and found that rbTNF&#x003b1; increased <italic>CPT1a</italic> abundance dose-dependently. Collectively, rbTNF&#x003b1; did not promote the pathways favoring hepatic lipid accumulation in early-lactation cows.</p><p>Lactating cows rely heavily on hepatic gluconeogenesis to meet glucose requirements because the majority of dietary carbohydrates are fermented in the rumen. Under steady-state conditions, the rate of glucose appearance equals the rate of its disappearance, and the calculated glucose turnover rate approximately equals gluconeogenesis in ruminants, because net portal appearance of glucose is negligible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Young1">[5]</xref>. In this study, there were no treatment effects on plasma glucose or insulin, abundance of key gluconeogenic transcipts, or plasma glucose turnover rate, indicating that low-grade inflammation did not affect hepatic gluconeogensis in early-lactation cows. Previous data regarding TNF&#x003b1; effects on gluconeogensis have been inconsistent. Short-term recombinant human TNF&#x003b1; administration at 10 &#x000b5;g/kg, but not 3.5 &#x000b5;g/kg, significantly increased glucose production (likely from glycogenolysis) and metabolic clearance rate in dogs; coupled with decreased fatty acid flux, the authors concluded that TNF&#x003b1; given in a high dose causes a shift toward carbohydrate as an energy substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Sakurai1">[36]</xref>. In a subsequent study, Sakurai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Sakurai2">[37]</xref> infused 2.5 &#x000b5;g/kg TNF&#x003b1; in dogs for 2 h and did not observe a change in glucose production.</p><p>The primary substrate for gluconeogenesis in ruminants is propionate, a short-chain fatty acid derived from ruminal fermentation; as a result, liver glucose production in cows is often a function of energy intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Reynolds1">[38]</xref>. To assess whether gluconeogenesis was affected by substrate supply, we expressed glucose production relative to feed intake. Interestingly, this analysis revealed that the 3 &#x000b5;g/kg rbTNF&#x003b1; treatment increased the apparent efficiency of gluconeogenesis from dietary substrates, primarily because of the low feed intake for that treatment. Given that propionate is used for glucose production at&#x0003e;90% efficiency in ruminants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Steinhour1">[39]</xref>, increased metabolic efficiency was not likely the reason for this response. When requirements are greater than nutrient intake, such as in early lactation, the contributions of lactate, glycerol, and amino acids from body tissues to gluconeogenesis increase markedly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Bell1">[40]</xref>. Glycerol is released primarily from adipose TG mobilization, which was likely unaffected by treatments (based on unaltered plasma NEFA). In an attempt to evaluate whether 3 &#x000b5;g/kg rbTNF&#x003b1;-treated cows had greater amino acid supply from protein mobilization, we measured concentrations of plasma 3-methylhistidine, a marker of muscle protein breakdown that has been shown to increase rapidly during the periparturient period and peak at 1 week after parturition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Blum1">[41]</xref>. Treatment effects on plasma 3-methylhistidine were not significant; however, the 3 &#x000b5;g/kg rbTNF&#x003b1; treatment mean was numerically 20% greater than the other treatments. It seems likely that a combination of slightly enhanced muscle proteolysis and decreased amino acid use for milk protein synthesis resulted in greater supply of amino acids for gluconeogenic substrate in the 3 &#x000b5;g/kg rbTNF&#x003b1; treatment.</p><p>Despite the lack of dramatic alterations in metabolism, the higher dose of rbTNF&#x003b1; tended to impair the health of postpartum cows. Health disorders affect considerable numbers of periparturient dairy cows, compromising animal welfare, milk production, and fertility. Ketosis is considered the most important metabolic disease in the U.S. dairy industry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Oetzel1">[3]</xref>, and ketotic cows are also at increased risk for other disorders, such as displaced abomasum and metritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Duffield1">[42]</xref>. Ketosis may increase the risk of infectious disorders through negative effects of ketone bodies on immune cell function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Grinberg1">[43]</xref>. In this study, rbTNF&#x003b1; increased the incidence of ketosis by 3-fold in the first week of lactation, accounting for much of the increase in total disease incidence. There are numerous mechanisms by which rbTNF&#x003b1; may have promoted subclinical ketosis, but poor feed intake in early lactation is a key risk factor for ketosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Grummer1">[1]</xref>, and it is likely that the suppression of intake by rbTNF&#x003b1; played a role in this study. Decreased feed intake did not decrease energy balance or increase lipolysis in this study, but low intake affects more than just energy status; decreased protein, mineral, vitamin, or lipid intake may have adversely affected health.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, rbTNF&#x003b1; treatment during the first 7 d of lactation decreased feed intake, reduced milk production, and tended to impair health status, but did not significantly alter glucose or lipid metabolism. These data indicate that in response to low-grade inflammation, early-lactation cows compensate for the reduced intake by suppressing milk production rather than further compromising their energy balance or systemic metabolism. This coordinated physiological response to inflammatory mediators can be considered a biological tradeoff between lactational performance and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080316-Ballou1">[44]</xref>. However, because effects on feed intake and milk yield occurred simultaneously, it is unclear whether one or the other was a secondary response. Further studies are needed to investigate if inflammation directly alters mammary or neurological function. Nevertheless, this study indicates that preventing excessive inflammation in early lactation has the potential to improve productivity and health of dairy cows.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Cheryl Armendariz, Brande Iseman, Hunter Sbisa, Sara Stoakes, Marilyn Diemer, Isabelle Withrock, Sydney Danner, and Michael Scheffel at Kansas State University for animal care and technical assistance.
