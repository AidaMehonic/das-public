We modified Charnov's classic diet composition model to describe the ecological dynamics of the related generalist and specialist bacteriophages &#x003c6;X174 and G4, and confirmed that specialist phages are ecologically favored only at high host densities. Our modified model accurately predicted the ecological dynamics of phage populations in laboratory microcosms, but had only limited success predicting evolutionary dynamics. We monitored evolution of attachment rate, the phenotype that governs diet breadth, in phage populations adapting to both low and high host density microcosms. Although generalist &#x003c6;X174 populations evolved even broader diets at low host density, they did not show a tendency to evolve the predicted specialist foraging strategy at high host density. Similarly, specialist G4 populations were unable to evolve the predicted generalist foraging strategy at low host density. These results demonstrate that optimal foraging models developed to explain the behaviorally determined diets of predators may have only limited success predicting the genetically determined diets of bacteriophage, and that optimal foraging probably plays a smaller role than genetic constraints in the evolution of host specialization in bacteriophages.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The advantages of host range expansion for parasites include reduced intraspecific competition for hosts, reduced time spent searching for hosts, and an increased probability of transmission to a suitable host <xref rid="pone.0001946-Futuyma1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Despite these advantages, parasites are most often observed to specialize on a limited number of host species. Explanations for the prevalence of host specialists may be ecological or evolutionary, and include ecological tradeoffs between diet breadth and diet quality <xref rid="pone.0001946-McPeek1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and genetic tradeoffs in the ability to utilize alternative hosts <xref rid="pone.0001946-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001946-Via1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Unlike investigations of predator foraging strategies that focus on the ecological explanations for specialization, investigations of parasite foraging strategies have focused on evolutionary explanations <xref rid="pone.0001946-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[e.g. 3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001946-Via1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> often ignoring ecological explanations entirely <xref rid="pone.0001946-Boivin1" ref-type="bibr">[but see 5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001946-Garnick1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The reason for this difference in focus is most likely methodological. Parasites are more amenable to genetic analysis and manipulation than predators, but parasites are less amenable to ecological observation.</p><p>The ecological explanation for the prevalence of host specialists comes from an optimal foraging model developed to describe the consequences of predator diet compositions. The model explores the trade-off between diet breadth and diet quality, and generally predicts that predators should specialize on a small number of highly profitable prey types unless prey abundance is low. Diet composition models have accurately predicted the diet composition of predators such as bluegill sunfish <xref rid="pone.0001946-Werner1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001946-Werner2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and great tits <xref rid="pone.0001946-Krebs1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and should be equally applicable to parasites <xref rid="pone.0001946-Garnick1" ref-type="bibr">[e.g. 6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001946-Abedon1" ref-type="bibr">[e.g. 10]</xref> as long as their encounter with hosts is governed by a first-order process in which encounter rates increase linearly with host abundance <xref rid="pone.0001946-Charnov1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus, diet composition models should accurately describe the ecology of parasites that are transmitted through the environment, but may not apply to parasites that require direct contact between infected and uninfected hosts or transmission by a specialist insect vector.</p><p>In this study we investigated the ability of optimal foraging theory to explain the prevalence of host specialists among bacteriophage, parasites that are both transmitted through the environment and amenable to experimental manipulation. Our interest in bacteriophages arose from recent observations that phages collected from higher host density coastal waters have a greater tendency toward host specialization than phages collected from lower host density pelagic ocean waters <xref rid="pone.0001946-Moebus1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0001946-Wommack1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The major observations come from studies that sampled phages by performing plaque assays on numerous bacterial strains that were co-isolated from the same marine waters, as in <xref rid="pone.0001946-Moebus2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The isolated phages were then tested for the ability to grow on bacterial strains other than the strain used to isolate that phage. Only 41 out of 217 phages (18.9&#x00025;) collected from low nutrient pelagic waters of the North Atlantic were specialists that grew only on the original host strain <xref rid="pone.0001946-Moebus3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, whereas 88 out of 194 (45&#x00025;) phages collected from productive waters off the German coast were host specialists <xref rid="pone.0001946-Moebus1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001946-Moebus4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These data suggest a relationship between host density and host specialization, as long as bacterial diversity was not higher in the low density environment &#x02013; a possibility that seems unlikely <xref rid="pone.0001946-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001946-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Although optimal foraging theory offers an intuitively appealing explanation for this observed relationship between host density and host specialization, even the richest marine environments achieve host densities that seem too low to explain the prevalence of specialist phages in the marine environment <xref rid="pone.0001946-Wommack1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This latter observation suggests that either the ecological dynamics of bacteriophage populations are not accurately described by diet composition models, or that the evolutionary dynamics are not well predicted by such models. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested the predictions of a diet composition model by monitoring the ecological and evolutionary dynamics in laboratory microcosms of populations of two related phages, the generalist phage &#x003c6;X174 that infects both <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (hereafter <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>), and the specialist phage G4 that infects only <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Optimal foraging in bacteriophages</title><p>In order to use the diet composition model of Charnov <xref rid="pone.0001946-Charnov1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> to describe the consequences of host specialization for bacteriophages, we modified the model slightly to account for the exponential growth dynamics of phages. Although the qualitative prediction that host specialization should be positively correlated with host abundance remains unchanged, the modification is necessary to quantify the host density above which specialization is favored. In Charnov's model, diet breadth changes as a function of the differences in search time (<italic>s</italic>), handling time (<italic>h</italic>), and energy content (<italic>E</italic>) between alternative hosts. These parameters are directly related to the phage life history parameters attachment rate (<italic>k</italic>), lysis time (<italic>L</italic>), and burst size (<italic>B</italic>), respectively.</p><p>In phages, attachment to a host bacterium is governed by first-order kinetics <xref rid="pone.0001946-Stent1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, thus phages bind to bacterial hosts according to the equation:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001946.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>P</italic> is the density of unattached phage, <italic>N</italic> is the density of hosts, and <italic>k</italic> is an attachment rate constant.

Thus, handling time is equivalent to lysis time (<italic>L</italic>), the time that elapses from attachment to lysis. Finally, the burst size (<italic>B</italic>), or number of progeny released after lysis is equivalent to the relative energy content of the host.</p><p>Foraging in phages differs somewhat from the original diet width models <xref rid="pone.0001946-Charnov2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001946-Pyke1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> because phage growth rates do not increase linearly with the energy content of the host. Instead, within-host replication of phages leads to an exponential increase in progeny numbers. In this case, phages increase over time according to:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001946.e003.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>P</italic>

Because phage populations grow exponentially, the rate of energy intake can be linearized by considering the rate of change in ln(<italic>P</italic>):<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001946.e004.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0001946.e005.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the average energy content of hosts included in the current diet, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0001946.e006.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0001946.e007.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> are the average search and handling times for hosts already included in the diet.</p><p>Using this framework we now consider the following question: Given that the <italic>i</italic>&#x02212;1 most profitable hosts &#x02013; ranked in decreasing order according to their profitability&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;ln(<italic>B<sub>i</sub></italic>)/<italic>L<sub>i</sub></italic> &#x02013; are already included in the diet, should the phage expand its diet by including the next most profitable host as well? To answer this question, imagine that the phage has encountered (attached to) a new host of rank <italic>i</italic>. If the phage consumes this host, it will achieve an instantaneous rate of energy intake of ln(<italic>B<sub>i</sub></italic>)/<italic>L<sub>i</sub></italic>. If the phage, instead, ignores this host and continues to search for a more profitable host, it will spend <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0001946.e008.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> time searching for and handling a more profitable host in order to take in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0001946.e009.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> energy content.

</p><p>The primary prediction of equation 5 is that host range should be negatively correlated with host abundance. When host abundance is low, search times are large, making it easy to satisfy the inequality. Bacteriophage should consume any host they encounter. As host abundance increases, search times approach zero, and it becomes increasingly difficult to satisfy the inequality. In this case, bacteriophage should consume only the most profitable hosts. We note that these are the classical predictions of the diet composition model <xref rid="pone.0001946-Charnov2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We have only fitted the classical model to describe the particular case of bacteriophage dynamics.</p><p>In the experiments that follow, we use equation 5 to identify the threshold host density above which specialists should be favored in laboratory microcosms containing two hosts. We then test the primary prediction of the model &#x02013; that host range should be negatively correlated with host abundance &#x02013; by examining the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of phage populations in laboratory microcosms maintained at host densities above and below this threshold.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Phage and bacterial strains</title><p>The bacteriophages &#x003c6;X174 and G4 are laboratory clones described in Bull et al. <xref rid="pone.0001946-Bull1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and Holder and Bull <xref rid="pone.0001946-Holder1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, respectively.

Approximately 10<sup>3</sup> phages were mixed with 1 mL of an exponentially growing culture at a density of &#x0223c;10<sup>8</sup> bacteria/mL and incubated with shaking at 37&#x000b0;C. Immediately (time <italic>t</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0), and then again after a few minutes (2, 4, 6 and 8 minutes for foraging model parameterization; 5 minutes only for evolution experiments), 150 &#x000b5;L of this mixture was centrifuged for one minute at 10K rpm and 100 &#x000b5;L of the supernatant was plated to count the unbound phages. The rate at which the concentration of unbound phages decreases is determined by the following equation:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001946.e011.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>P<sub>t</sub></italic> is the concentration of unbound phages at time <italic>t</italic> minutes, <italic>k</italic> is the attachment rate constant, and <italic>N</italic> is the concentration of bacteria.

Approximately 10<sup>3</sup> phages were mixed with 3 mL of an exponentially growing culture at a density of 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria/mL, and incubated shaking at 37&#x000b0;C. Aliquots of this mixture were plated at different time intervals to monitor the increase in phage concentration. Preliminary experiments indicated that lysis time occurred at about 15 minutes, so we plated to estimate phage concentration every 5 minutes for the first 10 minutes (well before lysis), and every 2 minutes between 14 and 22 minutes, and between 26 and 32 minutes (the time intervals in which lysis events were expected to occur). An initial latent period in which the concentration of plaque forming units (PFU) remains constant was followed by a lysis period in which the PFU concentration increases sharply (note that before lysis, the number of progeny phages increases, but as they remain inside the same bacterial cell, the apparent count in PFU is unchanged). The first time point at which the phage concentration increased to more than twice the initial concentration was identified, and lysis time (<italic>L</italic>) was calculated as the mean between this time point (immediately post lysis) and the previous time point (immediately pre lysis). Burst sizes were also estimated from one step growth curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001946-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The generalist phenotype of &#x003c6;X174 was advantageous at low host density (10<sup>6</sup> hosts/ml), but costly at high host density (10<sup>8</sup> hosts/ml).</p><p>The qualitative similarity between these results and observations from marine environments &#x02013; that phages collected from higher host density coastal waters have a greater tendency toward host specialization than phages collected from lower host density pelagic ocean waters <xref rid="pone.0001946-Moebus1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0001946-Wommack1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> &#x02013; suggests that diet breadth models may also explain bacteriophage host ranges in natural populations. However, the quantitative match between our data and observations from marine environments is not as good. In particular, the average marine environment achieves a bacterial density of approximately 10<sup>6</sup>/ml. As this bacterial density represents then entire bacterial community, the density of particular bacterial species is likely to be much lower. Our analysis suggests that this density is not sufficient to favor the evolution of specialist phages, and yet most phages isolated from nature infect only one or a few bacterial hosts <xref rid="pone.0001946-Sullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>Although optimal foraging does not appear to explain the prevalence of specialist phages in marine environments, the explanation may still be primarily ecological. For example, the scarcity of hosts (relative to phages) in the marine environment may impose intense resource competition, and host specialization may evolve as a mechanism to reduce this competition. On the other hand, we provide evidence that genetic constraints also contribute to the prevalence of specialist phages in nature.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Optimal foraging when diet breadth is determined genetically</title><p>A second explanation for the failure of the diet width model to explain the foraging patterns of bacteriophages in nature is that bacteriophages are parasites and not predators. Unlike predators that can change diet width behaviorally, bacteriophages change diet width only through genetic mutations. Thus, bacteriophages may be constrained in their diet choice in a way that predators are not. Our data support this expectation. Although the diet width model accurately predicted the <italic>direction</italic> of selection, it had only a limited ability to predict the <italic>response</italic> to selection. The ability to predict the response to selection depended on the mutational accessibility of appropriate genotypes. &#x003c6;X174 populations that were capable of generating appropriate genetic variation adapted to low host density as predicted, by increasing utilization of the less profitable host. In contrast, G4 populations were unable to produce mutations that allowed infection of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and were, therefore, unable to evolve a generalist phenotype.</p><p>We considered whether the inability of G4 populations to evolve a generalist phenotype resulted because G4 has less evolutionary potential than other phages, but we think this possibility unlikely. In particular, the fact that the &#x003c6;X174 genome encodes an identical set of genes, but possesses a generalist phenotype, indicates that these phages are not characterized by unusual functional constraints that prevent a generalist phenotype. Although phages that use alternative mechanisms of attachment (e.g. tailed phages which attach to their hosts through an appendage instead of directly with their capsid components) may be less evolutionarily constrained than G4, it is also possible that specialist phages often occupy regions of sequence space from which generalist genotypes are inaccessible.</p><p>Genetic constraints that act to limit host range in environments where hosts are rare would seem to pose a huge problem for bacteriophage survival and reproduction. One way that bacteriophage may get around this problem is to use a vertical mode of transmission (lysogeny) when host density is too low for horizontal transmission (lysis) to be effective <xref rid="pone.0001946-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Lysogeny is a process by which bacteriophage genomes integrate into the genome of the host, and are transmitted to the progeny during replication of the host genome. Some phages are also capable of entering into a pseudolysogeny state in which the viruses stay in a limited lytic mode, but still allow the host bacteria to grow and divide, ensuring their vertical transmission <xref rid="pone.0001946-Ripp1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Both lysogeny and pseudolysogeny occur in marine environments <xref rid="pone.0001946-Weinbauer1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and moreover, there is evidence that the proportion of bacteria containing lysogenic phage is negatively correlated with bacterial density <xref rid="pone.0001946-McDaniel1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001946-Williamson1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. This correlation is consistent with the optimal foraging predictions made here. The disadvantage of host specialization, and the corresponding advantage of lysogeny, is predicted to decrease with increasing bacterial density.</p><p>We conclude with the final caveat that attempts to explain the evolution of bacteriophage diet width using purely ecological models may be limited by the extent to which the underlying parameters search time, handling time, and energy content can themselves evolve. The difficulty arises from the difference between bacteriophage parasites and predators discussed above &#x02013; bacteriophage diets are determined genetically and approach optimality over an evolutionary rather than ecological timescale. The limited utility of the diet width model for predicting phenotypic evolution was apparent in the evolution experiments in which we adapted phage populations to a high host density. The diet width model and our ecological experiments both indicated that high host density would impose selection for reduced consumption of the inferior host <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. Consumption of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> is mediated by the rate of attachment to <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, but this trait did not evolve in the high host density evolution experiments. A possible explanation for this outcome is that selection was also acting on lysis time and burst size <xref rid="pone.0001946-Abedon1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001946-Abedon2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001946-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> to increase the profitability of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. If host profitabilities and diet width evolve simultaneously, optimal diet choice becomes a chicken and egg problem. In cases where parasite diets do appear optimal, two explanations are possible. Parasite diet breadth could have evolved to match available host profitabilities, or host profitabilities could have evolved to match the current diet.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank C.E.
