The enzymes that catalyze these activities are often contained within multiprotein complexes in nature. Two such multiprotein complexes, the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) methyltransferase and the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeler have been reported to act in opposition to each other during development and homeostasis. An imbalance in their activities induced by mutations/deletions in complex members (e.g. <italic>SMARCB1</italic>) has been suggested to be a pathogenic mechanism in certain human cancers. Here we show that preclinical models of synovial sarcoma&#x02014;a cancer characterized by functional SMARCB1 loss via its displacement from the SWI/SNF complex through the pathognomonic SS18-SSX fusion protein&#x02014;display sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2. Treatment with tazemetostat, a clinical-stage, selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 enzymatic activity reverses a subset of synovial sarcoma gene expression and results in concentration-dependent cell growth inhibition and cell death specifically in SS18-SSX fusion-positive cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Treatment of mice bearing either a cell line or two patient-derived xenograft models of synovial sarcoma leads to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition with correlative inhibition of trimethylation levels of the EZH2-specific substrate, lysine 27 on histone H3. These data demonstrate a dependency of SS18-SSX-positive, SMARCB1-deficient synovial sarcomas on EZH2 enzymatic activity and suggests the potential utility of EZH2-targeted drugs in these genetically defined cancers.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by Epizyme, Inc., Eisai Co, and Eisai, Inc.

There are many proteins involved in these processes, including protein methyltransferases (PMTs) and ATP-dependent chromatic remodelers [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158888.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In cells these enzymes are often presented as components of compulsory multiprotein complexes (i.e., enzymatic activity requires complex formation). Two such complexes are the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) Complex. Importantly, these two complexes normally compete with each other for binding to chromatin and have opposing functions: the PRC2 complex (of which EZH2 is the catalytic subunit) is responsible for the trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27Me3), leading to repression of gene expression, whereas the SWI/SNF complex is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler which allows for activation of gene transcription [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Interestingly, members of both of these complexes are frequently genetically altered in cancer and these mutations can create an imbalance in the antagonistic function between these two complexes [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158888.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For instance, SMARCB1 (INI1/SNF5/BAF47) is a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex that is lost in nearly all rhabdoid tumors, creating an oncogenic dependency on the PRC2-EZH2 methyltransferase, and sensitizing these tumors to small molecule inhibitors of EZH2 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158888.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The loss of SMARCB1 results in unregulated PRC2-mediated gene repression in these tumors, thus preventing the de-repression of genes involved in differentiation and other anti-tumorigenic functions. As such, inhibitors of EZH2 are now being tested in the clinic, and objective responses have been observed in SMARCB1-negative rhabdoid tumors in the setting of a Phase I study [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Additional mutations in the SWI/SNF complex are observed in a variety of tumor types, including mutations in <italic>SMARCA4</italic>, <italic>SMARCA2</italic>, <italic>ARID1A</italic> and others [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In synovial sarcoma a recurrent chromosomal translocation fuses the <italic>SS18</italic> gene (a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) on chromosome 18 to one of three related genes on the X chromosome, <italic>SSX1</italic>, <italic>SSX2</italic> and rarely <italic>SSX4</italic>, resulting in the expression of a SS18-SSX fusion protein [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This translocation is believed to be the sole driving event in synovial sarcomas [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], as expression of the translocation product in mouse models induces synovial sarcoma tumors at 100% penetrance [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and expression of the translocation in synovial sarcoma cell lines is required for their survival [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additionally, the <italic>SS18-SSX</italic> translocation is frequently the sole chromosomal aberration observed in synovial sarcoma, and there are very few additional mutations present in this indication [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Functionally, it has been shown that the SS18-SSX fusion protein is still incorporated into the SWI/SNF complex, with concomitant eviction of the SMARCB1 subunit [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The SMARCB1 protein may be relatively unstable in the absence of binding to the SWI/SNF complex, as the levels of SMARCB1 expression are greatly reduced in the presence of the SS18-SSX fusion [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This generates a state of SMARCB1-deficiency without mutations within the <italic>SMARCB1</italic> gene itself. SMARCB1 expression can be rescued by knockdown of the fusion protein or by overexpressing wild-type <italic>SS18</italic> (which competes for incorporation into the SWI/SNF complex) further confirming the misregulation of SMARCB1 expression induced by this translocation [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Given the sensitivity of SMARCB1-deficient tumors to EZH2 inhibition, and the diminution of SMARCB1 levels observed in SS18-SSX translocation positive synovial sarcomas, we hypothesized that synovial sarcomas may be similarly dependent on PRC2/EZH2 activity. Here we show that tazemetostat (formerly known as EPZ-6438 or E7438), an early clinical-stage, selective and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of EZH2 enzymatic activity induces anti-proliferative activity in preclinical models of synovial sarcoma, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy. We observe that synovial sarcoma cell lines are sensitive to inhibition of EZH2, and that this sensitivity correlates with alteration of expression of certain genes previously implicated in synovial sarcoma. A dependence on EZH2 activity is similarly observed in a cell line xenograft model as well as in two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, with correlative inhibition of trimethylation levels of the EZH2-specific substrate, H3K27. Thus, these data demonstrate a sensitivity of SS18-SSX-positive synovial sarcomas to inhibition of EZH2 enzymatic activity and support the further investigations in the clinical setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human synovial sarcoma line HS-SY-II was obtained from Riken BioResource Center.

Fuji cells were harvested during mid-log phase growth, and resuspended in HBSS with 50% Matrigel. Balb/C-nu mice received 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells (0.1 mL cell suspension) subcutaneously in the right flank. Mice carrying tumors of approximately 200 mm<sup>3</sup> for efficacy study (25 days after injection) or 260 mm<sup>3</sup> for pharmacodynamics study (26 days after injection) were sorted into treatment groups with similar mean tumor volumes. Tazemetostat, EPZ011989 or vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose + 0.1% Tween-80 in water) was administered at the indicated doses on twice a day schedules for either 7, 29 or 35 days by oral gavage. Due to reaching tumor volume endpoint on 2000 mm<sup>3</sup> some of the mice in the vehicle group needed to be euthanized on day 14. As reference compound, doxorubicin HCl in saline was dosed at 10 mg/kg. Each dose was delivered in a volume of 0.2 mL/20 g mouse (10 mL/kg), and adjusted for the last recorded weight of individual animals. Mice were monitored for overall health status daily during the dosing period or twice a week after the dosing period, and their tumor volumes were monitored twice a week using a digital caliper throughout the experiment. On day 7 of the pharmacodynamics study, mice were sampled in a prespecified fashion. Sampling included nonterminal bleeds (0.15 mL) from the retro-orbital venous plexus with anesthesia by isoflurane inhalation. Blood samples were processed for plasma, with Na-heparin as anticoagulant. The plasma samples were frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C and stored before bioanalysis of compound levels. Tumors were harvested from specified mice. Tumor tissue from each animal was frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C or stored in RNAlater (Ambion) and kept at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until total RNA purification was performed.</p><p>PDX studies (CTG-0771, CTG-0331, and CTG-1169) were performed at Champions Oncology. The protocols were approved by the IACUC of Champions Oncology (Permit Number: CHA-003-2013). Tumor fragments (5 mm x 5 mm x 5 mm) were harvested from donor animals, each implanted from a specific passage lot (CTG-0331 and CTG-0771 at P4). NCr-nu mice (Taconic) received the fragment subcutaneously in the flank region. Mice carrying tumors of approximately 100&#x02013;300 mm<sup>3</sup> were sorted into treatment groups with similar mean tumor volumes. Tazemetostat or vehicle (0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose +0.1%Tween-80 in water) was administered at the indicated doses on twice a day schedules for 35 days by oral gavage. As reference compound, doxorubicin HCl in saline was dosed at 3 mg/kg. Each dose was delivered in a volume of 0.2 mL/20 g mouse (10 mL/kg), and adjusted for the last recorded weight of individual animals. Mice were monitored for overall health status daily and their tumor volumes were monitored twice a week using a digital caliper throughout the experiment. For the CTG-0771 and CTG-0331 models, 3 to 5 mice per group with the largest tumors were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation on day 35 for blood and tissue sampling, and the 7 remaining mice were followed for an additional 25 days as animal survival study. Analgesics and anesthetics were not administered. Mice were humanely euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation if their body weights dropped more than 20% of the original weight for two consecutive measurements, more than 30% of the original weight for one measurement, their xenograft tumor grew larger than 2000 mm<sup>3</sup>, or they showed appear moribund at any time, while a tumor volume endpoint in Kaplan-Meier survival curve was 1200 mm<sup>3</sup>, with the exception of the slower growing CTG-1169 model for which 600 mm<sup>3</sup> was used as an endpoint for Kaplan-Meier survival curve Diet gel was provided <italic>ad libitum</italic> if their body weights dropped more than 10%. The summary of deaths for the 3 models is as follows: For CTG-0771 there was one animal found dead in 400&#x02013;500 mg/kg group. For CTG-0331 there was no dead animal. For CTG-1169 there were four animals that were found dead in multiple groups, two animals in 125 mg/kg group, one animal in 500 mg/kg group, and one animal in doxorubicin group.

RNA samples were converted into cDNA libraries using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA sample preparation kit (Illumina RS-122-2103). Briefly, Total RNA samples are concentration normalized, and polyadenylated RNA is purified using oligo-dT attached to magnetic beads. Purified mRNA is fragmented using heat in the presence of divalent cations. Fragmented RNA is converted into double-stranded cDNA, with dUTP utilized in place of dTTP in the second strand master mix. A single 'A' base is added to the cDNA and forked adaptors that include index, or barcode, sequences are attached via ligation. The resulting molecules are amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). During PCR the polymerase stalls when a dUTP base is encountered in the template. Since only the second strand includes the dUTP base, this renders the first strand the only viable template, thereby preserving the strand information. Final libraries are quantified, normalized and pooled. Pooled libraries are bound to the surface of a flow cell and each bound template molecule is clonally amplified up to 1000-fold to create individual clusters. Four fluorescently labeled nucleotides are then flowed over the surface of the flow cell and incorporated into each nucleic acid chain. Each nucleotide label acts as a terminator for polymerization, thereby ensuring that a single base is added to each nascent chain during each cycle. Fluorescence is measured for each cluster during each cycle to identify the base that was added to each cluster. The dye is then enzymatically removed to allow incorporation of the next nucleotide during the next cycle.</p><p>The raw read counts were transformed using voom and quantile normalized, which results in expression measures (summarized intensities) in log base 2. Statistical analysis was subsequently performed using empirical Bayes from the limma R package. Normalized data provide the input for statistical hypothesis testing, in which genes are identified that are statistically significantly different between sample groups, i.e. differences that are unlikely to be due to chance. The degree of difference, i.e. the fold-change, is also accounted for. In the output, the fold-changes (logFC) are given as log2 values, with a positive logFC representing up-regulation, and a negative logFC indicating down-regulation. For each comparison (e.g. A-B, which is the same as 'A relative to B'), the first group (A) is the numerator, while the second group (B) is the denominator. Thus, a positive logFC for the comparison 'A-B' indicates up-regulation in A relative to B. Comparisons were undertaken using linear modelling. Subsequently, empirical Bayesian analysis was applied (including vertical <italic>p</italic>-value adjustment for multiple testing, which controls for false discovery rate). For each comparison, the null hypothesis was that there was no difference between the groups being compared. Significant genes with adjusted <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 from each comparison were analyzed for enrichment of KEGG and GO pathway membership using a hypergeometric test. Enrichment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) was assessed for up- and down-regulated genes separately. The results from the three separate xenograft models were taken and a congruence analysis was performed to determine the extent of overlap between the differentially expressed genes and significantly enriched KEGG pathways and GO terms between cell lines.</p><p>RNA-seq data is available on the NCBI GEO repository under accession number GSE83479.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Sequencing of SS18-SSX translocation</title><p>25 mg frozen tissue was processed for RNA extraction using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

As previously reported, the Fuji cell line contains an SS18-SSX2 translocation [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], while the HS-SY-II cell line a SS18-SSX1 translocation [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; the RD and SW982 cell lines are soft tissue sarcoma cell lines that do not contain an SS18-SSX translocation [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and were included as controls. Although the SW982 cell line was formerly classified as synovial sarcoma, the molecular hallmark of synovial sarcoma is the SS18-SSX translocation [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and therefore the SW982 cell line is likely to be mis-classified and represent a separate, distinct type of soft tissue sarcoma. We confirmed the presence of a translocation in Fuji and HS-SY-II by immunoblot using an antibody for SS18, and the translocation was not detected in RD, SW982, nor in two additional non-synovial sarcoma cell lines included as negative controls (G401 and 293) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158888.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Additionally, the absence of mutations in EZH2 in these two synovial sarcoma cell lines was confirmed by sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158888.s001">S1A Fig</xref>).

Studies were performed in Balb/C nude mice bearing subcutaneous Fuji or HS-SY-II xenografts. Mice were dosed orally for 35 days (Fuji xenograft) or 28 days (HS-SY-II xenograft) with either tazemetostat or EPZ011989. We included EPZ011989 (an alternative EZH2 inhibitor of similar potency, selectivity and mode of action [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) as an additional control to demonstrate that effects on the xenografts are due to EZH2 inhibition and are not specific to tazemetostat exposure. Additionally, the effects of doxorubicin as a monotherapy or in combination with EZH2 inhibition were examined as doxorubicin is a standard of care for the treatment of patients with synovial sarcoma. Both tazemetostat and EPZ011989 alone were well tolerated with minimal effect on body weight; however, some body weight loss was observed in mice receiving doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158888.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). In the fast growing Fuji xenograft model, treatment with 250 mg/kg or 500 mg/kg BID tazemetostat led to a dose-dependent decrease in tumor volume, and treatment with 500 mg/kg BID EPZ011989 also inhibited tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158888.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The dose of 250 mg/kg BID tazemetostat induced tumor growth inhibition (43% at 14 days of treatment) and 500 mg/kg BID was sufficient to induce tumor stasis which continued until approximately 10 days after the cessation of dosing. The combination treatment with 250 mg/kg BID tazemetostat and doxorubicin showed superior antitumor effect compared to each monotherapy during the dosing period, although regrowth of the tumor was observed at approximately 8 days after cessation of dosing.

In a parallel 7-day dosing study systemic exposure of tazemetostat was found to be dose-dependent and exposure&#x02013;dependent decreases in intratumoral H3K27Me3 levels were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158888.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158888.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). However, unlike in the Fuji xenograft model, EZH2 inhibition did not lead to a decrease in tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158888.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), although H3K27Me3 levels were found to be inhibited in tumors collected at study end (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158888.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), and these cells were growth inhibited with tazemetostat <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158888.g001">Fig 1B and 1D</xref>). To examine potential causes for these discrepancies in xenograft sensitivity, we investigated whether there may be genetic or phenotypic differences between these two models. Synovial sarcomas are almost always diploid tumors with a very low frequency of chromosomal aberrations and mutations other than the <italic>SS18-SSX</italic> translocation [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158888.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The Fuji cell line was found to be a diploid cell line when first isolated, and we confirmed the chromosome number to be 45 (50 cells counted, data not shown), which was the same as previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In contract, the HS-SY-II karyotype has been described as a hypertriploid karyotype with many additional chromosomal alterations in addition to the SS18-SSX translocation [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further examination in which twelve independent metaphases were counted confirmed a karyotype ranging from 52&#x02013;61 chromosomes per cell, with many chromosomal alterations observed in addition to the SS18-SSX translocation, including a large number that were clonal in nature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158888.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). MBand analysis further found that the HS-SY-II cell line has variable numbers of t(x;18) fusions (mode number of 2) along with many other clonal and non-clonal chromosomal abnormalities involving chromosomes X and 18 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158888.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). This karyotype is suggestive of a cell line with a highly unstable genotype that is undergoing ongoing chromosomal changes, and thus may not be representative of typical synovial sarcomas. Additionally, this data shows that the HS-SY-II cell line is highly heterogeneous, and raises the possibility that the tumor cells that contribute to the xenograft growth <italic>in vivo</italic> may not be representative of the <italic>in vitro</italic> cell line, potentially explaining the differences in the phenotypic effects of EZH2 inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> vs. <italic>in vivo</italic>. Expression of CD57/Leu-7, a marker which is highly expressed in many synovial sarcoma patients [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], displayed mixed expression in the original tumor from which HS-SY-II was isolated [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], suggestive of a mixed population of cells. It was previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and we further confirmed that while the HS-SY-II <italic>in vitro</italic> cell line has high levels of CD57, the expression of CD57 is significantly lower in the xenograft (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158888.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). Thus the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models for HS-SY-II may represent highly distinct cell populations. Lastly, we examined expression of SMARCB1, which shows an altered expression pattern in the majority of synovial sarcomas [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158888.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. While the levels of SMARCB1 were indeed low in both the Fuji and HS-SY-II cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158888.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), only the Fuji xenograft displayed a decrease in SMARCB1 staining while the HS-SY-II xenograft displayed no such decrease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158888.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). As the deficiency in SMARCB1 expression was the original hypothesis that led us to investigate the use of EZH2 inhibitors in synovial sarcoma, this may explain the differential sensitivity observed in this model. As such, we believe that the karyotype, unstable genotype, CD57 staining, and lack of SMARCB1-deficiency suggest that HS-SY-II is not a representative xenograft for SMARCB1-deficient synovial sarcoma.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Anti-tumor activity is observed in two PDX models of synovial sarcoma</title><p>Given the importance of using model systems that most accurately recapitulate the clinical disease, we also investigated how synovial sarcoma PDX models respond to EZH2 inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Indeed, we find that <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>SS18-SSX</italic> translocation-positive synovial sarcoma cell lines are sensitive to the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat. Furthermore, these cell lines display tazemetostat-induced changes in gene expression consistent with modulation of genes aberrantly expressed in synovial sarcoma that include well known targets of PRC2, such as cell cycle regulators. We additionally observed sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition in a SMARCB1-deficient synovial sarcoma xenograft, but not a synovial sarcoma xenograft expressing wild-type levels of SMARCB1. Furthermore, two PDX models of synovial sarcoma displayed sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition. A third PDX model tested showed only a modest and not statistically significant tumor growth inhibition when compared to vehicle. This model, however, displayed very slow growth characteristics which could in part explain the more subtle effect of tazemetostat dosing during the study observation period. Thus, SMARCB1-deficient synovial sarcoma represents an additional indication which may display clinical response to EZH2 inhibition. While this manuscript was under review an additional study using a structurally similar inhibitor of EZH2 also reported sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition in cell culture models of synovial sarcoma [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] including additional cell line models. Our study expands on this work by examining <italic>in vivo</italic> models as well as gene expression changes observed both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We have previously shown that SMARCB1-negative MRT tumors are sensitive to EZH2 inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, Italiano and colleagues recently reported evidence of antitumor activity in tazemetostat-treated adult patients with SMARCB1-negative MRT [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In MRT, SMARCB1 is lost due to biallelic inactivation of its gene, whereas in synovial sarcoma, SMARCB1 levels are lowered due to the presence of the SS18-SSX fusion protein. This suggests that SMARCB1 expression can be reduced by multiple mechanisms, potentially leading to sensitivity in other cancer types. Interestingly, the HS-SY-II model is sensitive <italic>in vitro</italic> but not <italic>in vivo</italic>, correlating with a lack of SMARCB1 loss in the <italic>in vivo</italic> model. Additionally, of the three PDX models, the most sensitive model displays the greatest decrease in SMARCB1 expression. It has been reported that clinically 86% of synovial sarcoma tumors display low SMARCB1 expression, although the degree of expression varies across tumor specimens [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158888.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Further studies are needed to explore the relationship between SMARCB1 expression and EZH2 dependence in synovial sarcoma. Furthermore, other members of the SWI/SNF complex are frequently lost or mutated in cancers [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158888.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and it will be of interest to investigate whether altered SWI/SNF activity through mutation or expression changes of a given complex subunit in general predicts sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition.</p><p>The mechanism(s) by which <italic>SS18-SSX</italic> translocations lead to tumorigenesis is currently being investigated by different groups, with at least two mechanisms currently suggested. Two reports from Nielsen and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158888.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] have suggested that the oncogenic SS18-SSX fusion protein leads to recruitment of the PRC2 complex to ATF2 target genes, resulting in aberrant inhibition of the transcription of these target genes. ATF2 target genes include <italic>ATF3</italic> and <italic>EGR1</italic>, which regulate proliferation, stress response, differentiation and apoptosis, among other functions. In agreement with this, we see that treatment with tazemetostat does lead to an increase in <italic>ATF3</italic> expression in the <italic>SS18-SSX</italic> positive but not negative synovial sarcoma cell lines. Modulation of <italic>EGR1</italic> expression, however, was less consistent. This suggests that different ATF2 target genes may be differentially impacted by either the SS18-SSX fusion protein and/or EZH2 inhibition. There also may be cell line specific differences, such as basal expression level of the target genes, expression of <italic>ATF2</italic>, or SS18-SSX expression. And finally, gene expression changes may be different <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, highlighting the need to examine multiple markers under both conditions.</p><p>Another mechanism that has been suggested for SS18-SSX induced tumorigenesis is via assembly of aberrant SWI/SNF complexes which are abnormally targeted, specifically to the <italic>SOX2</italic> loci [<xref rid="pone.0158888.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This increased binding at the <italic>SOX2</italic> loci results in a decrease in H3K27Me3 levels at the promoter, suggesting that the aberrant SWI/SNF complex displaces PRC2/EZH2 leading to the loss of repressive chromatin marks. However, we observe no increase in <italic>SOX2</italic> expression upon treatment with EZH2 inhibitors <italic>in vitro</italic>. This suggests either that PRC2 function at the <italic>SOX2</italic> loci is already fully inhibited in translocation positive synovial sarcoma cells, and thus <italic>SOX2</italic> expression cannot be upregulated any further, or that other mechanisms are regulating <italic>SOX2</italic> expression. However, an increase in <italic>SOX2</italic> expression was observed in the Fuji xenograft at the highest dose, a dose at which tumor stasis was observed. Thus, the observed antiproliferative effect of EZH2 inhibition is likely a result of the balance between multiple different pathways (proliferation, survival, etc.). In support of this, we observed modulation of other pathways that would predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition, including increased <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, which is both a known target of PRC2/EZH2 as well as a tumor suppressor. Of note, we do observe upregulation of <italic>SOX2</italic> in a MRT cell line (G401) treated with EZH2 inhibition (unpublished data); however, the cell line displays exquisite sensitivity to inhibition of EZH2 and display modulation of other genes which may override the changes in <italic>SOX2</italic> expression. These data suggest that <italic>SOX2</italic> expression alone does not dictate the proliferation response, at least in MRT. Thus, in determining the phenotypic outcomes of PRC2 inhibition it will be important to monitor the expression of multiple pathways and not just the expression of one gene.</p><p>In summary, the data presented in this work suggest that synovial sarcomas, like MRTs, are SMARCB1-deficient tumors that are sensitive to EZH2 inhibition. These observations warrant further investigations in a clinical trial setting. Correlative translational studies in conjunction with these clinical trials will be important to decipher whether other genetic or transcriptomic factors besides the presence of the oncogenic SS18-SSX fusion protein will influence sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158888.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Further characterization of synovial sarcoma cell lines.</title><p>(A) Sequencing analysis of <italic>EZH2</italic> hot spots revealed no mutations in either the Fuji or HS-SY-II cell line.
