The LW line had smaller embryo and body weights than the RBC line in all age groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). During 3 to 42 d post-hatch, the LW line exhibited approximately 60% smaller weight of pectoralis major muscle (PM), mainly resulting from lower fiber numbers compared to the RBC line (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). During early post-hatch period when myotubes are still actively forming, the LW line showed impaired PM growth with prolonged expression of Pax7 and lower expression levels of MyoD, Myf-5, and myogenin (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), likely leading to impairment of myogenic differentiation and consequently, reduced muscle fiber formation. Additionally, the LW line had delayed transition of neonatal to adult myosin heavy chain isoform, suggesting delayed muscle maturation. This is further supported by the finding that the LW line continued to grow unlike the RBC line; difference in the percentages of PMW to body weights between both quail lines diminished with increasing age from 42 to 75 d post-hatch. This delayed muscle growth in the LW line is accompanied by higher levels of myogenin expression at 42 d (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), higher percentage of centered nuclei at 42 d (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), and greater rate of increase in fiber size between 42 and 75 d post-hatch (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) compared to the RBC line. Analysis of physiological, morphological, and developmental parameters during muscle development of the LW quail line provided a well-characterized avian model for future identification of the responsible genes and for studying mechanisms of hypoplasia and delayed muscle growth.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant no. 2010-65206-20716 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and the National Research Foundation of Korea and the Agenda Program no.

The quail has been used as an animal model for the muscle growth and development because of its relatively rapid generation time <xref rid="pone.0095932-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, easy access to study embryonic muscle development, and conservation of muscle developmental processes with mammals. With these advantages, several lines of quail have been developed by selection for body weight from the random bred control (RBC) Japanese quail for over 40 generations at The Ohio State University <xref rid="pone.0095932-Nestor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Nestor2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Selection of quail led to establish a heavy weight (HW) quail line that exhibited more than two times greater pectoralis major muscle weight (PMW) than the RBC quail line, which is accompanied by muscle hypertrophy rather than muscle hyperplasia <xref rid="pone.0095932-Choi2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, the selected line of quail for the low weight (LW) line has not yet been characterized for muscle growth and development. Previously, several muscular dystrophy animal models with dysfunctional muscles have been extensively characterized <xref rid="pone.0095932-Bandman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095932-Chamberlain1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Decreased muscle mass in physically normal avian species with delayed muscle growth during development, including the LW quail line, is far from well-known. Thus, understanding developmental characteristics of these muscles as an animal model is necessary for the improvement of muscle growth in animals and humans.</p><p>Muscle growth and ultimate muscle mass are largely determined by both initial numbers of muscle fibers and growth of size and length of individual muscle fibers during the postnatal period <xref rid="pone.0095932-Rehfeldt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Thus, both number and size of muscle fibers are correlated with growth rate and muscle mass <xref rid="pone.0095932-Rehfeldt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Choi3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. On the other hand, selection for body weight and muscle mass in livestock has altered the muscle fiber characteristics <xref rid="pone.0095932-Chiang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Broiler-type chickens selected by their growth capacity exhibited a greater number and size of muscle fibers <xref rid="pone.0095932-Scheuermann1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and the pectoralis major muscle is more glycolytic and composed of almost entirely larger type IIB fibers compared to layer-type chickens <xref rid="pone.0095932-Aberle1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Tobalske1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Whereas, the pectoralis major muscle of the volant species, including quail, is more oxidative and composed of type IIA and IIB fibers due to their flight behavior <xref rid="pone.0095932-Kovacs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The HW quail line exhibited a higher percentage of type IIB fibers compared to the RBC quail line <xref rid="pone.0095932-Choi2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>There are complex interplays of factors and consequent physiological changes that regulate skeletal muscle growth and development. During development, muscles become adapted to perform specialized and diverse functions, which are accompanied by temporal changes in the composition and level of expression of various myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms within muscle, as MHC is the major component of the contractile apparatus of muscle fibers <xref rid="pone.0095932-Pette1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Agbulut1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The embryonic and neonatal MHC isoforms are expressed in a temporal and tissue-specific manner during muscle development, and further these developmental MHC isoforms are down-regulated and replaced by adult MHC isoforms after hatch or birth <xref rid="pone.0095932-Pette1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Schiaffino1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. There are marked differences in the expression and transition of these MHC isoforms between muscle and breed <xref rid="pone.0095932-Agbulut1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Wick1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095932-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Muscles harboring a higher proportion of fast-twitch fibers showed a rapid growth rate <xref rid="pone.0095932-Choi3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and the developmental MHC isoforms were rapidly replaced by the adult MHC isoforms after birth compared to muscles harboring a higher proportion of slow-twitch fibers in mice <xref rid="pone.0095932-Agbulut1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In the avian model, the embryonic to adult MHC isoform transition is occurring faster in chicken breeds selected by their growth capacity than chicken breeds selected by their egg production <xref rid="pone.0095932-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Like the transition of expression of MHC isoforms considered as a developmental process of muscle, the paired box transcription factor Pax7 is also a well-known proliferation maker, and is necessary for myogenic cell development and satellite cell specification <xref rid="pone.0095932-Seale1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Pax7 expression is associated with the existence of active satellite cells, and is important in hyperplastic and hypertrophic growth in skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0095932-RopkaMolik1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Moreover, MyoD and Myf-5 have been used as markers of proliferation to differentiation events <xref rid="pone.0095932-Riuzzi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The basic helix-loop-helix myogenic regulatory factors, including MyoD, Myf-5, and myogenin, play seminal functions that trigger the expression of myofibrillar proteins and permit the assembly of functional muscle fibers <xref rid="pone.0095932-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Muscle fiber hyperplasia occurs with high expression of MyoD and Myf-5 proteins <xref rid="pone.0095932-DeAlmeida1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Myogenin is required for committed cells to terminally differentiate into myocytes and mature into muscle fibers, thus associated with muscle fiber hyperplasia and hypertrophy <xref rid="pone.0095932-AlMusawi1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Therefore, temporal expression of these myogenic markers is related to temporal expression of developmental MHC isoforms within muscle <xref rid="pone.0095932-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Generally, comparison of the expression patterns of these markers among animals with different muscle growth and development would provide a reliable indication of affected developmental process.</p><p>Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the differences in histochemical characteristics of the pectoralis major muscle, as well as, temporal expression of MHC isoforms and myogenic markers, and their relationship to muscle growth in the LW quail line compared to the RBC quail line. The main goal of the current study is to provide a new avian model with well-characterized muscle growth and development and to further investigate for identification of a causative factor which is considerably important to improve muscle growth for production efficiency of food animals and a potential application to human health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at The Ohio State University.

Fertile eggs were stored under normal storage condition (12&#x000b0;C with 70% relative humidity). Fertile eggs from the LW and RBC quail lines were incubated in a hatchery (Type 65Hs, Masallles, Spain). At 9, 11, 13, and 15 d of incubation, six eggs from each line (total 48 eggs) were randomly selected from the hatchery and weighed; and six embryos from each line were extracted and weighed. Embryo percentage was calculated as the ratio of embryo weight to egg weight. After hatching, quail from each line were reared in heated Petersime battery brooders with wire-mesh floors. Quail were maintained in battery cages grouped by each line, and were fed a commercial diet ad libitum in accordance with the National Research Council <xref rid="pone.0095932-National1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

Thus, area and percentage of each region in the pectoralis major muscle were measured separately.

All stained muscle samples at 42 and 75 d post-hatch were examined by an image analysis (Image-Pro Plus). At least 600 fibers were evaluated per sample. The average CSA of muscle fibers was determined as the ratio of total area measured divided by total number of muscle fibers, and CSA for type IIA and IIB fibers were also measured. Muscle fiber density (fiber numbers/mm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated from the mean number of fibers per mm<sup>2</sup>, as well as fiber density of each fiber type. Area percentage of each fiber type was calculated as the proportion of total CSA of each fiber type divided by total fiber area measured. Number percentage of each fiber type was calculated as the proportion of total number of each fiber type divided by total fiber numbers (TFN) measured.

Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in tris-buffered saline-tween (TBST; 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, plus 0.15% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in 5 different primary antibodies: 2E9 antibody (neonatal MHC isoform coded by the gene MYH8; 1&#x02236;1,000 dilution), AB8 antibody (which reacts with all adult fast MHC isoforms (IIA, IIX, and IIB) coded by the genes MYH2, MYH1, and MYH4, respectively; 1&#x02236;1,000 dilution), Pax7 antibody (1&#x02236;500 dilution; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), MyoD antibody (1&#x02236;1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and Myf-5 antibody (1&#x02236;500 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO). The MHC primary antibodies (2E9 and AB8) were a gift from Everett Bandman (University of California, Davis).

Differences in MHC isoforms and myogenic markers expression between the different quail lines across all experimental time points were investigated first (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1). This initial view of temporal expression patterns allow us to focus on specific time points when there were obvious differences, to further compare three individuals per group. The 2E9 primary antibody, which is specific for the neonatal MHC isoform, reacted with MHC in the LW quail line from 7 to 42 d post-hatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095932-g006">Figure 6A</xref>); whereas, its expression had a much wider range of time period from 3 to 75 d post-hatch in the RBC quail line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095932-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This isoform was then abolished in the LW quail line at 75 d post-hatch, whereas in the RBC quail line it persisted until 75 d post-hatch. Moreover, the neonatal MHC isoform was only expressed in the RBC quail line at 3 d post-hatch. The AB8 antibody detected the adult MHC isoform from 28 through 75 d post-hatch in the RBC quail line; whereas, the adult MHC isoform was found only at 75 d post-hatch, which was the predominant isoform expressed in the LW quail line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095932-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). However, there was no significant difference in the expression level of the adult MHC isoform between the different quail lines at 75 d post-hatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095932-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).

Thus, myogenic regulatory factors were differentially expressed in the LW and RBC quail lines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The LW quail line has a distinct growth pattern compared to the RBC quail line. The LW quail line exhibited smaller embryo sizes than the RBC quail line in all embryonic age groups. These differences in embryo growth between the two quail lines could be explained by a study conducted by Lilja and Olsson <xref rid="pone.0095932-Lilja1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, who reported that the difference in embryo growth has been presumed to be due to differences in egg size, and corresponding nutrient availability. In this study, the LW line had lower egg weights compared to the RBC line (6.9 vs. 8.5 g, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), which might affect the growth rates of embryos in the two quail lines. The RBC line harboring a greater birth weight had approximately three times greater PMW than the LW line harboring a lower birth weight at 42 d post-hatch due to the results of selection (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Thus, the growth pattern of the LW quail somewhat supports the previous finding that low birth weights are generally accompanied with lower potential growth rates, and associated with lower fiber hyperplastic potential <xref rid="pone.0095932-Quiniou1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Rehfeldt2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In the current study, the LW quail are an unique bird model with lower weight and smaller area of pectoralis major muscle at 42 d post-hatch that were mainly associated with muscle fiber hypotrophy and hypoplasia, especially a lower fiber number of deep region (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and type IIA fiber number (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), compared to the RBC quail line.</p><p>However, as the LW quail has been selected from the RBC quail population on the basis of their lower body weight at 4 weeks of age, the growth of the LW line was much slower than the RBC line up to 4 weeks of age. Thereafter, differences in body weight (2.4 to 1.3 times) and PMW (3.6 to 1.3 times) between the RBC and LW quail lines diminished with increasing age from 28 to 75 d post-hatch. This is due mainly to the fact that the LW line continued to grow from 42 to 75 d post-hatch unlike the RBC line. PMW of the LW quail line at 75 d post-hatch was more than 2 times heavier than that of the LW quail line at 42 d post-hatch (8.8 vs. 3.7 g, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001); whereas, TFN (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) was still smaller in the LW line compared to the RBC line at 75 d post-hatch. This later growth of the LW quail line is accompanied by a later increase in muscle fiber CSA from 42 to 75 d post-hatch (440 vs. 698 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and a higher centered nuclei percentage in the deep region of the pectoralis major muscle at 42 d post-hatch (19.9 vs. 12.6%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) suggesting delayed muscle maturation <xref rid="pone.0095932-FarkasBargeton1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-FarkasBargeton2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Therefore, the most important time window affecting ultimate muscle mass is different between the LW and RBC quail lines. These delayed muscle maturation and fiber hypertrophic potential in the LW line may be associated with a late catch-up growth (acceleration of growth rate). Catch-up growth has been characterized by rapid growth after a temporary period of growth retardation occurring in humans and animals <xref rid="pone.0095932-Kays1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. However, its accurate mechanisms are not clear, and the LW quail line can be a good model for understanding the phenomenon of late catch-up growth.</p><p>An outstanding increase of growth performance can be achieved through selection, as well as several concomitant alterations in muscle fiber characteristics, especially muscle fiber type composition <xref rid="pone.0095932-Rehfeldt3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Generally, animals selected by their muscle growth rate had muscles with a higher percentage of larger type IIB fiber and a lower percentage of smaller type I fiber <xref rid="pone.0095932-Scheuermann1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-CassarMalek1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Choi4" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In the current study, the LW quail line selected for a lower body weight did not differ considerably in fiber type composition compared to the RBC quail line at 42 and 75 d post-hatch. Thus, fiber type composition was found to have only a limited effect on body and muscle weights between the different quail lines.</p><p>During muscle development, several distinct MHC isoforms progressively appeared within the same muscle <xref rid="pone.0095932-Pette1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Schiaffino1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The nomenclature of MHC isoforms (embryonic, neonatal, and adult isoforms) indicates their expression periods during muscle development, although embryonic and neonatal MHC isoforms actually persisted in fetal and adult muscles, respectively <xref rid="pone.0095932-Stockdale1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. During postnatal development, embryonic and neonatal MHC isoforms are sequentially abolished at various time periods, and MHC transitions occur with age according to changes in muscle characteristics toward metabolic maturation for gaining contractile ability <xref rid="pone.0095932-Schiaffino1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In mice, the neonatal MHC isoform in the plantaris muscle (fast-twitch muscle) was rapidly replaced by the adult MHC isoforms after birth; whereas, this isoform in the soleus muscle (slow-twitch muscle) persisted until 21 d after birth <xref rid="pone.0095932-Agbulut1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Lee et al. <xref rid="pone.0095932-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> reported that the adult MHC isoform was first detected after 11 d post-hatch in the pectoralis major muscle of broiler chickens, whereas the replacement of neonatal by adult MHC isoform was first shown at 27 d post-hatch in the pectoralis major muscle of the Leghorn chickens. In this study, clear differences were observed in the MHC isoform transition between the different quail lines. The neonatal MHC isoform was detected earlier in the RBC line compared to the LW line. In addition, the expression of the adult MHC isoform began at 28 d post-hatch in the RBC line, whereas expression was only detected at 75 d post-hatch in the LW line. This neonatal to adult MHC transition that occurs during development is associated with the time of skeletal muscle maturation <xref rid="pone.0095932-Bandman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the current study, delayed maturation of postnatal muscle in the LW quail line may allow the later hypertrophic growth of muscle that has occurred much earlier in the RBC quail line.</p><p>The adult MHC isoform in the pectoralis major muscle is a predominant isoform of normal chickens during muscle maturation; whereas, the abundance of the neonatal isoform and lack of the adult isoform were observed in the adult dystrophic chickens <xref rid="pone.0095932-Bandman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, muscular dystrophy, which is a developmental disorder, is associated with the MHC composition or interference of the transitions of MHC isoforms during muscle maturation <xref rid="pone.0095932-Bandman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the current study, both the quail lines showed normal physical activities including walking and flying abilities as assessed at 75 d post-hatch. Thus, unlike muscle dystrophic chickens with an absence of the adult MHC isoform, the LW quail line with the delay in transition to the adult MHC isoform and developmental process of skeletal muscle could serve as a unique model.</p><p>It is generally accepted that muscle fiber number is fixed before birth in most terrestrial vertebrates <xref rid="pone.0095932-Rehfeldt3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Picard2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In large mammals, such as cattle, sheep, and human, the major events of contractile and metabolic differentiation occur during the last period of gestation, and are fully achieved soon after birth <xref rid="pone.0095932-Picard2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In cattle, embryonic and neonatal MHC isoforms are completely supplanted by adult MHC isoforms at the end of gestation <xref rid="pone.0095932-Picard3" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. However, in rodents and birds that are prematurely born in terms of physical activity, maturation of muscle fiber occurs during the first postnatal month when the neonatal MHC isoform is disappearing and the adult MHC begins to be dominantly expressed <xref rid="pone.0095932-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Gondret1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Bredman1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Interestingly, the LW line (42 to 75 d post-hatch) have a lot of delay at the beginning the transition of neonatal to adult MHC isoforms compared to the RBC line (28 d post-hatch), which is associated with different times of gaining flying abilities between the two quail lines. In addition, the initial time of the neonatal MHC expression and expression of early myogenic markers in the quail breast muscle after hatch, which generally occurs in the fetal muscle of the large mammals, further suggests that development of quail muscle within one week after hatch could be equivalent to the stages of muscle development with the late fetal ages of large mammals. In this regard, these differences in the kinetics of muscle fiber development between species are associated with their maturity at birth, and delayed muscle growth in less mature species is accompanied by less physical ability at birth compared to large mammals <xref rid="pone.0095932-Picard2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In fact, most of the small volant species including quail have achieved the requirements for high frequency operation and resistance to fatigue associated with hovering and flapping flight during the first few weeks after post-hatch due to their immature muscle fiber structure and feather formation, while most of the large vertebrates have achieved the physical ability to perform the movement shortly after birth. Considering the late development of muscle maturation in the quail, the time window for muscle fiber formation, especially in breast muscle, may be extended to the early post-hatch period in quail. This is further supported by the finding that muscle fiber hyperplasia in animals is largely completed before or after birth or hatch depending on times of maturation of various muscles <xref rid="pone.0095932-Picard2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Rayne1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095932-Summers1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The muscles used right after birth or hatch tend to mature sooner, and their fiber numbers are determined earlier than the other muscles that require being fully functional at a much later time. For example, in the rectus femoris muscle of mice, which is necessary for lifting the leg, the fiber number is fixed around the time of birth <xref rid="pone.0095932-Rehfeldt4" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Whereas, the fiber number of the medial pterygoid, a quadrilateral muscle for mastication, increased by two-fold from birth to 6 weeks in the rats, perhaps due to the required gaining of strength and mass of the pterygoid during the transition from sucking milk to eating solid chow diets <xref rid="pone.0095932-Rayne1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Considering the immature breast muscle of the quail chick at hatch, it is possible that the fiber number may be increased during the early post-hatch. It will be interesting to evaluate an increase in fiber number, although our trial for measuring fiber number at early post-hatch was hampered by limitations of counting the total number in a cross section, such as fiber branching, nascent short fibers being longitudinally arranged in series, and difficulty in decision on exclusion or inclusion of very small-fiber like shapes.</p><p>Pax7 is strictly expressed in myogenic and satellite cells and induces myoblast proliferation <xref rid="pone.0095932-RopkaMolik1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Pax7 is down-regulated during differentiation <xref rid="pone.0095932-RopkaMolik1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. After the differentiation period, high levels of Pax7 could inhibit myogenesis and induce cell cycle exit even in growth conditions to maintain satellite cell population <xref rid="pone.0095932-Olguin1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In this study, Pax7 expression persisted longer in the LW quail line until 14 d post-hatch compared to the RBC quail line. These results suggest delayed satellite cell proliferation and myogenic differentiation in the LW quail line, which is further evidenced by the delayed expressions of neonatal and adult MHC isoforms in the LW line compared to the RBC line.</p><p>Rudnicki et al. <xref rid="pone.0095932-Rudnicki1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> reported that MyoD and Myf-5 play crucial roles in the differentiation of muscle precursor cells to myogenic cells. The essential roles of MyoD and Myf-5 in myogenesis were further evidenced by the finding that double mutant mice [<italic>MyoD(-/-);Myf-5(-/-)</italic>] are unable to form muscle fibers, a result of absent myoblasts <xref rid="pone.0095932-DeAlmeida1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Prolonged expression of Pax7, which is associated with delayed muscle growth in the LW quail, led to further investigate expression of myogenic factors involved in differentiation, the next step after Pax7 in the general processes of myogenesis. In this study, the LW quail line showed lower expression levels of MyoD (0 and 3 d) and Myf-5 (3 and 7 d) at the early post-hatch period compared to the RBC quail line. In fact, amounts and time of expression of these proteins could be major factors affecting the population of differentiated myocytes that contribute to formation of muscle fibers <xref rid="pone.0095932-DeAlmeida1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, higher expression levels of primary MRFs at the early post-hatch period suggest that the myogenic differentiation was earlier and stronger in the RBC quail line, while lower expression levels of primary MRFs in the LW quail line could suppress sequential processes of myogenesis, consequently resulting in a reduction of total fiber number.</p><p>In support of this, expression levels of myogenin were significantly lower in the LW quail line during early post-hatch periods compared to the RBC quail line (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Myogenin is a secondary MRF acting downstream of primary MRFs, MyoD and Myf-5, and the absence of myogenin prevented skeletal myoblasts from contributing to postnatal muscle hyperplastic and hypertrophic growth <xref rid="pone.0095932-LeGrand1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Knapp et al. <xref rid="pone.0095932-Knapp1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> reported that low expression level of myogenin in postnatal period leads to the reduced body weight, but normal skeletal muscle in mice. Taken together, up-regulation of Pax7 and down-regulation of MyoD, Myf-5 and myogenin suggest that the LW quail likely have impairment in the differentiation stage of myogenesis, which consequently leads to hypoplastic muscle growth in the LW line at the early post-hatch period. Contrarily, higher levels of myogenin expression at 42 d post-hatch were associated with a higher hypertrophic potential of the LW quail line, which support the delay in muscle growth with the remaining lower number of muscle fibers. These data further support that muscle fiber numbers are determined within the time window from embryonic to the early post-hatch period in quail.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study are the first comparison of physiological, morphological, and developmental parameters between the LW and RBC quail lines during muscle development. Overall, the results indicate that muscle fiber hypoplasia has more impact on body and muscle weights of the LW quail line selected for a lower body weight at 4 weeks of age compared to muscle fiber hypotrophy. However, a late catch-up growth via delayed muscle fiber hypertrophy was observed in the LW quail line between 42 and 75 d post-hatch, which associated with a higher percentage of centered nuclei and a higher expression level of myogenin at 42 d post-hatch. Muscle fiber hypoplasia and delayed growth pattern in the LW quail line may be influenced by the delayed transition of neonatal to adult MHC isoform and expression time and expression levels of Pax7 and MRFs. The most important time window affecting muscle fiber hypoplasia in LW quail line was between 0 to 3 d post-hatch. At this period, the LW quail line showed decreased expression levels of myogenin (0.5 vs. 3.6 folds) and impaired pectoralis major muscle growth (0.9 vs. 1.4 folds) compared to the RBC quail line. The results from the current study provide a useful avian model for understanding the mechanisms underlying decrease in muscle mass due to impaired and delayed muscle growth during development and increased hypertrophic potential during maturation. To practically apply this knowledge for the improvement of muscle mass in food animals and human health, more information must be gathered on causative events during development and identification of genes responsible for muscle fiber hypoplasia and delayed fiber hypertrophy in the LW quail.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0095932-Picard1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Picard</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jurie</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Duris</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Renand</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name> (<year>2006</year>) <article-title>Consequences of selection for higher growth rate on muscle fiber development in cattle</article-title>. <source>Livest Sci</source><volume>102</volume>: <fpage>107</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>120</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0095932-Choi1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>YM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sarah</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wick</surname><given-names>WP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>BC</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2013a</year>) <article-title>Comparative growth performance in different Japanese quail lines: the effect of muscle DNA content and fiber morphology</article-title>. <source>Poult Sci</source><volume>92</volume>: <fpage>1870</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>1877</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23776275</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0095932-Nestor1"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Nestor</surname><given-names>KE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bacon</surname><given-names>WL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lambio</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name> (<year>1982</year>) <article-title>Divergent selection for body weight and yolk precursor in Coturnix coturnix japonica. 1.
