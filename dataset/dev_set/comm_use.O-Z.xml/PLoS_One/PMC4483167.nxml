Previous studies showed that <italic>Streptococcus oligofermentans</italic>, a non-mutans streptococci frequently isolated from caries-free subjects, inhibited the cariogenic <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> by the production of hydrogen peroxide (HP). Since pH is a critical factor in caries formation, we aimed to study the influence of pH on the competition between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> in biofilms. To this end, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> were inoculated alone or mixed at 1:1 ratio in buffered biofilm medium in a 96-well active attachment model. The single- and dual-species biofilms were grown under either constantly neutral pH or pH-cycling conditions. The latter includes two cycles of 8 h neutral pH and 16 h pH 5.5, used to mimic cariogenic condition. The 48 h biofilms were analysed for the viable cell counts, lactate and HP production. The last two measurements were carried out after incubating the 48 h biofilms in buffers supplemented with 1% glucose (pH 7.0) for 4 h. The results showed that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> inhibited the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> in dual-species biofilms under both tested pH conditions. The lactic acid production of dual-species biofilms was significantly lower than that of single-species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> biofilms. Moreover, dual-species and single-species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> biofilms grown under pH-cycling conditions (with a 16 h low pH period) produced a significantly higher amount of HP than those grown under constantly neutral pH. In conclusion, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> inhibited <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> in biofilms not only under neutral pH, but also under pH-cycling conditions, likely through HP production. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> may be a compelling probiotic candidate against caries.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human oral cavity harbours a dynamic microbial community, which consists of more than 700 bacterial species [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the healthy situation, this community maintains a healthy microbial homeostasis, through a dynamic balance of synergistic and antagonistic microbial interactions. Disturbance of this homeostasis can lead to shifts in microbial composition and eventually cause diseases <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. dental caries [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Dental caries is chemical dissolution of the dental hard tissues by the acid produced when bacteria metabolise dietary carbohydrates. Under prolonged low-pH environment, the outgrowth of acidogenic and aciduric species such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli shifts the microbial composition and enhances the dissolution of the dental hard tissue, eventually causing caries [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One of the key concepts in the prevention and treatment of dental caries is to prevent disturbance of or to re-establish a healthy microbial homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Clinical studies have indicated that in the dental biofilms high numbers of non-mutans streptococci, such as <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus gordornii</italic>, were often associated with low numbers of cariogenic bacteria <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and this association was mostly observed in healthy subjects, while the inverse was typically found in subjects with caries [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These findings have emphasised the potential of caries prevention via modulating oral microbial ecology.</p><p>Among the commensal oral non-mutans streptococci, <italic>Streptococcus oligofermentans</italic> has several interesting traits. It was frequently isolated from caries-free subjects or healthy non-carious tooth surfaces [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It produced less acid from glucose than <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and inhibited the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. With molecular techniques, Tong <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] demonstrated that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> inhibited the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> through the production of hydrogen peroxide (HP) both in suspensions and in biofilms. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> employs three types of enzymes, pyruvate oxidase (POX), lactate oxidase (LOX) and L-amino acid oxidase, to produce HP [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The synergistic action of POX and LOX maximized the HP production of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The ability of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> producing HP from lactic acid is particularly interesting, since lactic acid is the major organic acid produced by dental biofilms. This trait of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> may provide dual benefits: minimising pH drop by converting lactic acid into HP and inhibiting the cariogenic bacteria <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> through HP production. Therefore, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> may be a good probiotic candidate for maintaining healthy oral microflora.</p><p>Although several studies have reported that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> could inhibit the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> in a dual-species biofilm [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], some characteristics of the biofilm model used in these studies may limit the clinical relevance of their findings: firstly, the studied biofilms were &#x0201c;bottom-biofilms&#x0201d;. These biofilms mostly contain sedimented cells, which are not incorporated by active attachment, while active attachment is a prerequisite for oral biofilm formation. Secondly, the pH in the bottom-biofilm model was unknown and not controlled. Environmental factors, such as the presence of oxygen, sugar availability and pH, were shown to greatly affect the HP production of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic>, thereby its inhibition on the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A previous study demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> decreased with the decreasing pH value. At pH 5.5, no interaction between two species was observed in the agar competition assay [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> was known to be aciduric and to be able to outcompete other bacterial species at cariogenic condition (pH 5.5), the above findings seemed to suggest the limitations of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> in maintaining healthy microflora at cariogenic conditions. As only planktonic cultures were tested in the previous study, it is relevant to re-evaluate the influence of pH in a biofilm model that allows bacterial active attachment.</p><p>The aims of this study are to establish a pH-controllable active-attachment biofilm model and to explore the competition between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> in biofilms under two different pH conditions, constantly neutral pH and pH-cycling. The pH-cycling included a period of 8 h at neutral pH and a period of 16 h at pH 5.5, with the intention to mimic cariogenic conditions that dental biofilms often encounter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The strains used in this study were <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> UA159 and <italic>Streptococcus oligofermentans</italic> LMG22279 [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Both bacterial strains were grown anaerobically (90% N<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 5% H<sub>2</sub>) at 37&#x000b0;C.

For pre-cultures, BMG was prepared by adding 0.4% of glucose to BM and for biofilm growth, BMS was prepared by adding 0.2% of sucrose to BM. This sucrose concentration was chosen because it could promote biofilm formation without causing pH changes.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Biofilm growth</title><p>Biofilms were grown in an active attachment model [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This model consists of a standard 96-well microtiter plate and a lid with an identical number of polystyrene pegs that fit into wells (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). This model was chosen to examine exclusively the actively adhered biofilms, instead of bacterial sedimentation in the 96-well microtiter plate, and to retain the 96-well high-throughput advantage for testing multiple variables. Single or dual-species biofilms were grown for 48 h before further analysis.

To grow dual-species biofilms, the overnight cultures of each strain were diluted to a final OD<sub>600nm</sub> of 0.08 in BMS (pH 7.0) and mixed at 1:1 ratio before dispensing 200 &#x003bc;l into the 96-well plate.

The plate was then covered with the lid containing pegs and incubated for 8 h. Thereafter, the pegs were rinsed with sterile distilled water to remove non-adherent bacterial cells. After rinsing, half of the pegs were inserted in BMS of pH 7.0, while the other half was inserted in BMS of pH 5.5, and both were further incubated for 16 h. Subsequently all pegs were rinsed with sterile distilled water and inserted again in BMS of pH 7.0. After another 8 h incubation, the pegs were inserted in either BMS of pH 7.0 or BMS of pH 5.5 for another 16 h. The 48 h biofilms formed on the pegs were collected for viable cell counts and were examined for their capability to produce lactic acid and HP.

The pH of dental biofilms at these sites drops rapidly upon intake of carbohydrates and can remain below pH 5.5 for a substantial period of time [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The prolonged low pH condition favours the aciduric bacterial species, such as cariogenic mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, which are able to survive and grow under this adverse condition [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Acid tolerance is considered the virulence trait for cariogenic bacteria to outcompete other microbes in dental biofilms. In this study, the competition between the cariogenic <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> and the commensal <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> in dual-species biofilms was examined under either a constantly neutral pH or a pH-cycling condition (with a 16 h low pH period) in an active attachment biofilm model. Our data demonstrated that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> strongly inhibited the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> in dual-species biofilms and reduced lactic acid concentration at not only neutral pH condition, but also the pH-cycling condition. The inhibition of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> on the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> in dual-species biofilms has been reported in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. What is new in our finding is that the biofilms were formed through an active attachment process, while the previous studies formed the biofilms at the bottom of the wells. Since <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> is known to adhere better to a surface than other streptococci under sucrose condition, one could question if <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> was still able to suppress <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> in the actively attached biofilms. The data from this study provided a positive answer to the question. Moreover, a recent study found that a low pH environment (pH&#x0003c;6.0) affected the ability of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> to inhibit the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This result is contradictory to what we reported here. The discrepancy in these two studies might be explained by the experimental design. In the study of Liu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the competition between two species was only tested on agar plates with various pH levels. Therefore, the growth of both bacterial species (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic>) was affected by the constantly low pH, which made the competition between these two species impossible to observe. In our study, the oscillation of pH between 7.0 and 5.5 allowed the growth of both bacterial species. This design mimics the clinical condition better and makes it possible to study the competition between both species. Overall, our finding implied that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> might be a compelling probiotic candidate to compete against cariogenic bacterial species at sites prone to caries.</p><p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> is known to be acid tolerant. Previously, a panel of oral streptococci was tested for their acid tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. All <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> strains were more aciduric than tested non-mutans streptococci, like <italic>S</italic>. <italic>sanguinis</italic>. Although substantial evidence has indicated that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>sanguinis</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>gordonii</italic> were capable of inhibiting the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic>, these results were mostly achieved at a neutral pH environment. When a multi-species community was incubated under prolonged low pH condition, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> would be favoured while <italic>S</italic>. <italic>sanguinis</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>gordonii</italic> would be suppressed [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>gordonii</italic> was once tested as a probiotic for its inhibition on the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> in a rat caries model [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. But <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> was found to overgrow <italic>S</italic>. <italic>gordonii</italic>, irrespective of the availability of sucrose and inoculation sequences. Therefore, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>sanguinis</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>gordonii</italic> may not be a good probiotic candidate to inhibit <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> at caries susceptible sites. The data presented here suggested that unlike <italic>S</italic>. <italic>sanguinis</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>gordonii</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> could inhibit <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> even after co-incubation at low pH for 16 h. This trait was indicated by the relatively high CFU counts of single-species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> biofilms under pH-cycling condition. It seems that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> is as acid resistant as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic>, since a similar level of CFU reduction was observed for both bacterial species when comparing pH-cycling condition with neutral pH condition.</p><p>Another intriguing finding of this study was the enhanced HP production of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> biofilms after growth under pH-cycling conditions. This was unexpected since the number of viable <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> cells grown under pH-cycling conditions was much lower than of those grown under neutral pH conditions. There are a few possible explanations. The first one is that the presence of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mutans</italic> in dual-species biofilms might trigger the HP production under pH-cycling conditions. But it could not explain why the HP production in single-species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> biofilms was as high as dual-species biofilms. The second explanation is that the high HP production was caused by the high lactate concentration, since <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> is able to convert lactate into HP [<xref rid="pone.0130962.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This assumption could explain the low lactate concentration observed in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> biofilms. But it could not explain why lactate concentration in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> biofilms was similar under both pH conditions, while HP production was different. The third explanation is related to the plating method used in this study. Since this method cannot detect those viable but not culturable bacterial cells, the unculturable <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> cells in the biofilms might be the reason for the high HP production. We have carried out the metabolism (resazurin) assay to examine the metabolic activity of the tested biofilms, besides plating. This assay is able to detect viable bacterial cells without the requirement of further culturing. The results obtained from the assay were consistent with the results obtained from the plating method (data not shown). The fourth explanation is that the prolonged low pH incubation triggered the stress response of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> cells and resulted in enhanced HP production after the bacterial cells were incubated at neutral pH again. To explore this assumption, we carried out an additional experiment on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> suspension cells. Our data indicated 16 h, but not 4 h, mild acid pre-challenge could indeed increase the HP production per <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> cell, even though the overall HP increase was not as pronounced as in biofilms.</p><p>In this study, we successfully established a high-throughput pH-cycling biofilm model. In order to establish a controllable pH-cycling condition, different buffers (phosphate or MES buffer) were added to the growth media. As a result, the pH of the biofilms could be maintained as designed. Since dental biofilms in the oral cavity constantly experience pH fluctuations, the established model can mimic this fluctuation condition and help to understand its influence on the bacterial interaction in dental biofilms. On the other hand, we also realized that the presented biofilm model, though well controlled, is too simple to fully mimic the complex oral conditions. Several important factors, such as dental hard tissues as substrata, salivary buffering, salivary flow or a multi-species community, should be taken into account in the model in the future studies. Eventually, the feasibility of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> as a probiotic under cariogenic condition should be evaluated in a more realistic model, such as an animal model.</p><p>In summary, the data presented here indicated that the non-mutans streptococci <italic>S</italic>. <italic>oligofermentans</italic> not only have the reported properties, including low acidogenic and being an HP producer, but also is aciduric and able to produce a substantial amount of HP after substantial acid challenge in the biofilms.
