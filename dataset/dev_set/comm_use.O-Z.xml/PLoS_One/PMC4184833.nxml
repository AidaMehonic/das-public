As an example, we use DpnI immobilized on magnetic beads. The ten minute extraction technique allows specific binding of genomes containing the DpnI G<sup>m6</sup>ATC motif common in the genomic DNA of many bacteria including &#x003b3;-proteobacteria. Using synthetic genome mixtures, we demonstrate 80% recovery of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> genomic DNA even when only femtogram quantities are spiked into 10 &#x000b5;g of human DNA background. Binding is very specific with less than 0.5% of human DNA bound. Next Generation Sequencing of input and enriched synthetic mixtures results in over 100-fold enrichment of target genomes relative to human and plant DNA. We also show comparable enrichment when sequencing complex microbiomes such as those from creek water and human saliva. The technique can be broadened to other restriction enzymes allowing for the selective enrichment of trace and unculturable organisms from complex microbiomes and the stratification of organisms according to restriction enzyme enrichment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this research was provided in full through contract HSHQDC-10-C-00019 to FLIR Systems Inc. by the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dhs.gov/">http://www.dhs.gov/</ext-link>.

NGS has broadened the study of the prokaryotic world beyond the small fraction of bacteria (less than 1%) thought to be culturable <xref rid="pone.0109061-Vartoukian1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109061-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109061-Amann1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Using NGS for metagenomic studies, in which an entire sample of mixed organismal DNA is sequenced, has the advantage of querying the entire population of isolated DNA and overcomes many biases of other metagenomic methods such as microarray analysis or multiplex PCR. However, there are some drawbacks to using NGS metagenomic strategies. First, sensitivity to microbes may be decreased in the presence of large amounts of non-informative DNA (e.g. eukaryotic DNA). Second, typical metagenomic samples can contain hundreds of bacterial species making it difficult to parse and assemble genomes <xref rid="pone.0109061-Carr1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Recently developed methods to selectively enrich prokaryotic DNA exploit the 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in CpG sites of eukaryotes (mCpG), a modification largely absent in the bacterial world. One method uses a methyl-binding protein/Fc fusion protein to bind eukaryotic mCpG containing DNA and remove it from the mixture <xref rid="pone.0109061-Feehery1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In an alternate approach, a truncated version of the human cytidylate-phosphate-deoxyguanylate protein has been used to bind non-methylated CpG sequences in bacterial DNA <xref rid="pone.0109061-Sachse1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Bacteria have other stable epigenetic modifications in addition to 5mC including 6-methyladenine (6 mA) and 4-methylcytosine (4mC). The 6 mA modification was shown to occur at 94.1% of the 41,791 GATC sites in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> genome <xref rid="pone.0109061-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and is widespread in prokaryotes but is otherwise reported only in ciliates and lower eukaryotes <xref rid="pone.0109061-Ratel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The DNA adenine methyltransferase (DamMT) directs adenine methylation within the context of GATC sequences and is found in at least one clade of bacteria consisting of the orders Enterobacteriales, Vibrionales, Aeromonadales, Pasteurellales and Alteromonadales <xref rid="pone.0109061-LobnerOlesen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, GATC methylation influences chromosome replication, gene expression and mismatch repair. In <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> it is required for viability and in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> it may act as a virulence factor <xref rid="pone.0109061-LobnerOlesen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. 6 mA is also generated by some methyltransferases (MTases) as part of restriction modification systems <xref rid="pone.0109061-Loenen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Restriction endonucleases rely on methylation patterns to combat invasive genomes, particularly phage, while avoiding digestion of host DNA. Evolution has thus selected for enzymes with exquisite methylation sensitivity.</p><p>Here we present a restriction endonuclease-mediated DNA enrichment approach. DpnI is a methyl-directed restriction endonuclease that restricts DNA only when it is methylated on adenine residues within the GATC sequence <xref rid="pone.0109061-Lacks1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109061-Vovis1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We therefore anticipated that DpnI could distinguish bacterial genomes containing the G<sup>m6</sup>ATC DNA modification from other bacterial and eukaryotic DNA. By manipulating the reaction conditions, we can use it to bind DNA without cutting. Since DpnI binds to DNA only when it is adenine methylated within GATC sites we predicted little or no binding to eukaryotic DNA and highly specific binding to DNA from DamMT+ bacteria. We demonstrate that DpnI can selectively enrich microbial DNA from synthetic and real-world samples. We extend our approach to a second restriction enzyme, DpnII that specifically enriches non-methylated GATC DNA (<italic>e.g</italic>. human genome). DNA enriched by this method can be used for PCR, qPCR and NGS analysis. The technique can enable the targeted enrichment of genomes from various microbiomes or the specific identification of pathogens from complex samples. We envision the use of restriction endonuclease binders to stratify complex metagenomic samples into groupings based on methylome signatures. This could link DNA fragments in otherwise poorly assembled contigs, aiding the reconstruction of genomes from unculturable organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Genomic DNA was obtained from the ATCC with the exception of the following: <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA); <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, <italic>Franscisella tularensis</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia mallei</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic>, <italic>Brucella abortus</italic>, <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (BEI Resources, Manassas, VA); and Human, Arabidopsis and Rice (Zyagen, San Diego, CA).

To test this, we covalently bound biotin to DpnI to facilitate immobilization of the enzyme onto streptavidin coated particles. This necessitated purification of DpnI since commercial sources for the enzyme are dilute and contain other proteins that prevent us from selectively biotinylating the restriction enzyme. The activity of purified DpnI both before and after biotinylation was analyzed by restriction digestion of pUC19 isolated from DamMT+ <italic>E. coli</italic>.

We tested DpnI digestion of pUC19 in the absence of magnesium ions and did not observe cleavage activity, as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0109061-Lacks1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Since the absence of magnesium might also affect the binding of DpnI to its target, we tested both DpnI and DpnI-biotin in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. A FAM-labeled oligonucleotide duplex containing a single G<sup>m6</sup>ATC sequence was incubated with increasing amounts of DpnI and DpnI-biotin. Both DpnI and DpnI-biotin are able to bind and shift G<sup>m6</sup>ATC containing DNA in the absence of magnesium and no noticeable decrease in the binding affinity is observed when DpnI is biotinylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To test our hypothesis that DpnI could be used to separate G<sup>m6</sup>ATC containing DNA from fragments without G<sup>m6</sup>ATC sites, we used a mixture of a 477 bp Dam-methylated DNA fragment and a 651 bp non-methylated fragment. The two fragments both contained seven GATC sites and were derived from overlapping regions in pUC19 to minimize bias caused by sequence differences. DpnI-biotin was immobilized onto streptavidin-magnetic particles and titrated into a mixture of the two fragments. DNA that bound to the DpnI-coated particles was eluted and desalted. All fractions were separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel. An increase in the amount of DpnI-beads resulted in further depletion of the 477 bp fragment. The eluted fractions contained only the 477 bp fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;9) leaving the non-methylated 651 bp fragment in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5). Thus immobilized DpnI specifically bound G<sup>m6</sup>ATC containing DNA (477 bp) which could be purified away from other fragments.</p><p>After observing efficient segregation of specific G<sup>m6</sup>ATC DNA fragments, we investigated whether DpnI-biotin was suitable for isolating a G<sup>m6</sup>ATC-containing genome when mixed with GATC-containing genomes.

Enrichment was also specific, with 99.6% of Human DNA remaining unbound. Comparable isolation efficiency was observed for the DNA mixtures prepared in buffers ranging from pH 4 to 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally when fragment sizes were at least 3 kb, DpnI binding was not significantly affected, but did decrease with smaller fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109061.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0109061-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0109061.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Efficiency and range of DpnI pull-down.</title><p>(A) Immobilized DpnI was incubated with a mixture of <italic>E. coli</italic> and human DNA for varying amounts of time. 40% of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA binding occurs on less than one minute.

We therefore tested the limits of DpnI separation by incubating various amounts of <italic>E. coli</italic> and human DNA with immobilized DpnI. To test the sensitivity of DpnI separation, the level of human DNA was held constant at 1 &#x000b5;g and <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA was titrated from 1 ng to 10 fg.

Sensitivity was observed to 10 fg <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA, the detection limit of the qPCR assay used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This demonstrates efficient separation by DpnI of G<sup>m6</sup>ATC containing DNA when present at as low as 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> of the level of eukaryotic DNA.</p><p>We next tested the ability of DpnI to exclude human DNA present at high concentrations. When the concentration of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA was held constant at 1 ng while increasing the concentration of human DNA, we observed <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA recovery as high as 82% and exceeding 60% even in the presence of 10 &#x000b5;g of human DNA, a 10,000-fold difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). These results demonstrate that DpnI DNA segregation is effective and efficient with differing ratios of target versus non-target DNA.</p><p>We next examined how efficiently DpnI binds genomes from a variety of organisms including some that are clinically relevant <xref rid="pone.0109061-Low1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. For each organism of interest, 1 ng of bacterial genomic DNA was combined with 1 &#x000b5;g of human DNA. DNA mixtures were incubated with immobilized DpnI. Following segregation, DNA in the DpnI bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by qPCR. DpnI successfully bound and separated genomic DNA from gram-negative organisms known to express DamMT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109061-t001">Table 1</xref>). The range of recovery was between 50% and 100% of the measured input. For gram-negative bacteria not known to have a DamMT gene, recovery was lower, from 10% to 45% of the measured input, but still significantly higher than binding to human DNA. Binding of gram-positive bacterial DNA was less than 3% and binding to eukaryotic DNA was below 0.5%. We conclude that DpnI can be used to efficiently bind and segregate genomes from a wide variety of organisms with very little binding to eukaryotic DNA.</p><p>To test how well DpnI enrichment can improve the coverage and read depth of prokaryotic DNA in a mixture, we designed a synthetic mixture of genomic DNA that included both eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109061-t002">Table 2</xref>). Human DNA made up the bulk of the mixture at over 97% by weight. DNA from rice (1%) and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (1%) was added to represent plant and fungal genomes, respectively. Microbe genomes were added in a pair-wise fashion. Each pair consisted of an equal amount of DNA from a DamMT+ and a DamMT- organism, and subsequent pairs were diluted ten-fold to test the limit of DpnI enrichment. The DNA mixture was subjected to DpnI segregation. The DNA from the bulk mixture, the unbound fraction and the bound/eluted fraction were used to prepare sequencing libraries. We found that the number of reads from eukaryotes was dramatically reduced in the DpnI-bound fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109061.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Reads mapping to the human genome made up 59% of the mapped reads in the synthetic mix input but only 5% in the DpnI-bound fraction. The reads mapping to <italic>Oryza</italic> (rice) were also greatly reduced, from 31% of the mapped reads in the input sample to 2.5% of the mapped reads in the bound fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0109061-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0109061.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>DpnI enriches prokaryotic DNA as determined by NGS.</title><p>(A) NGS reads from the input, bound and unbound fractions of the synthetic mix.

We isolated DNA from saliva and performed a DpnI separation. The input, bound/eluted and unbound fractions were sequenced. Whereas human reads made up over 75% of the total reads in the input sample, following DpnI enrichment less than 5% of the total reads were human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Prokaryotic reads increased from less than 5% of the total reads to over 50% in the DpnI-enriched fraction. There are a significant number of reads that could not be assigned to any organism. This is likely due to the high number of unsequenced organisms in the sample. The most abundant genera in the sample were <italic>Haemophilus, Neisseria, Veillonella, Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>. Together these five genera comprised 87% of reads mapped to prokaryotes.

DpnII is known to have the opposite activity of DpnI in that it recognizes and cuts only non-methylated GATC sequences and DpnII activity is blocked by 6 mA. We therefore expected DpnII to bind to human, but not <italic>E. coli</italic> genomic DNA. Similar to our experiments with DpnI, we immobilized DpnII to test its ability to separate a mixture of 1 ng of human DNA and 500 ng of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA. DpnII was able to enrich the human DNA with minimal binding to <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109061.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore restriction endonuclease-mediated DNA separation is not limited to DpnI.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Type II restriction endonucleases have been selected during evolution to ensure they do not cut their own DNA, a suicidal event, while quickly binding to and digesting any foreign DNA that lacks the correct methylation pattern <xref rid="pone.0109061-Vasu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. We demonstrate that manipulation of <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions enables DpnI to bind but not cut DNA containing its target sequence. While the binding affinity of DpnI has not been determined, several restriction enzymes have been measured in the picomolar <xref rid="pone.0109061-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109061-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> to nanomolar range <xref rid="pone.0109061-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109061-Sudina1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and our results support the use of restriction enzymes as strong and specific DNA binding proteins.</p><p>DpnI binding to target DNA was rapid, with 75% of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA bound after only 5 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We also observed highly specific binding with over 99.5% of human DNA excluded and over 80% of targeted <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g002">Figure 2A, C and D</xref>).

<xref rid="pone.0109061-Bonnet1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Immobilized DpnI can be used to differentially bind and segregate prokaryotic DNA present at 1/10,000 the level of eukaryotic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Efficient removal of background human genetic material enables pathogen DNA to be concentrated to achieve sensitive detection which could be particularly useful for un-culturable pathogenic bacteria. This feature could be exploited for the diagnostic detection of trace amount of pathogens in clinical samples such as blood from patients with septicemia, a serious infection that lacks an early detection method <xref rid="pone.0109061-Yagupsky1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>One critique of using a methyl-directed binding protein to enrich DNA is that the process may introduce coverage bias with more reads observed in close proximity to the protein binding site. However, when samples were separated by DpnI and then analyzed by NGS, DpnI enrichment resulted in very low sequence coverage biases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The even coverage is likely due to the frequency and distribution of DpnI binding sites in target DNA. For example, in <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, there are approximately 42,000 GATC sites, 94% of which have been shown by SMRT sequencing to be adenine methylated with an average gap between GATC sites of about 250 bp <xref rid="pone.0109061-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Additionally, DpnI segregation generated low biases when input DNA fragments were above 3 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109061.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus typical DNA isolation procedures are sufficient to achieve efficient DpnI segregation. Biases could arise however if smaller bacterial fragments, from degraded DNA for instance, are present.</p><p>We predicted little or no binding to eukaryotic DNA and highly specific binding to DNA from DamMT+ bacteria. We did not anticipate the low level binding of DpnI to micro-organisms not known to contain G<sup>m6</sup>ATC sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This <italic>in vitro</italic> non-canonical binding may simply reflect a difference in DNA binding affinity compared to the more rigorously studied specificity of restriction activity. Published factors known to affect restriction specificity of DpnI include the presence of non-GATC sequences that contain a methylated adenine residue <xref rid="pone.0109061-Siwek1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and DNA topology effects <xref rid="pone.0109061-Kingston1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Alternatively, DNA modifications other than 6mA may be affecting DpnI binding specificity. Although DpnI needs a G<sup>m6</sup>ATC site to cut, it appears that at least some amount of binding occurs when that pattern is absent and that binding decreases in the presence of CpG methylation. We observed that when the <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> genome which is not known to contain G<sup>m6</sup>ATC is treated with a CpG methyltransferase, binding drops significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109061.s004">Figure S4</xref>). It is unknown whether this is a differential feature of binding versus digestion or an artifact of biotinylation. A more in-depth study of DpnI binding patterns is needed to better understand the binding to DNA from DamMT- organisms.</p><p>Observations to date suggest that methyl signatures created by restriction modification systems are only sporadically distributed amongst microbial taxa <xref rid="pone.0109061-Vasu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109061-Seshasayee1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In contrast, orphan MTases, such as DamMT, are often conserved across extensive groups of bacteria which rely on these methylation patterns to control crucial cellular processes like chromosome replication <xref rid="pone.0109061-LobnerOlesen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109061-Marinus1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We consider DamMT+ bacteria to be part of a more expansive methylome which would include organisms which methylate at GATC sites in other contexts (<italic>e.g</italic>. <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic>, BamHI GG<sup>6m</sup>ATCC). The broad and deep genomic coverage consistently observed when sequencing DpnI enriched DamMT+ bacterial DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g004">Figure 4</xref>) suggests that the binding kinetics are equivalent across these organisms. We hypothesize that with regard to G<sup>6m</sup>ATC, organisms may divide into genomes that (A) have a DamMT-like density of G<sup>6m</sup>ATC sites and are highly enriched, (B) lower site density that are only slightly enriched and (C) those genomes with no G<sup>6m</sup>ATC sites. This last category may be greatly discriminated against if it possess mCpG sites, as does human DNA, or may result in an equal in abundance in the bound fraction and the input sample when CpG sites are absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109061-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), as is the case for most bacteria.</p><p>We demonstrated that by purifying DNA by methylome, enrichment exceeding 50-fold of specific genomes is possible. In the case of the water sample, an organism closely related to <italic>Aeromonas salmonicida</italic> was highly enriched, with hundreds of thousands of non-normalized reads in the DpnI bound fraction compared to approximately 5000 in the input library. Typically, the high complexity of a microbiome would make reassembling genomes of unknown species challenging. Existing methods rely on bioinformatics, using alignment to reference genomes, nucleotide composition <xref rid="pone.0109061-Herlemann1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, differential coverage binning <xref rid="pone.0109061-Albertsen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, or variations in gene count <xref rid="pone.0109061-Carr1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> to achieve partial assemblies. Our enrichment approach increases coverage, facilitates informatics processes and provides opportunities to characterize previously unsequenced and unculturable microbial taxa in diverse microbial communities.</p><p>Enrichment upstream of NGS allows for better coverage and increased certainty of the presence of organisms. This may be useful for samples with a very high load of eukaryotic DNA, such as those from the throat, buccal mucosa, or saliva <xref rid="pone.0109061-MethBA1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The DpnI enrichment of pathogen DNA from saliva has several potential applications. Bacterial populations in saliva change in response to many disease conditions <xref rid="pone.0109061-Malamud1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Identification and quantification of bacterial profiles may be important for detection of oral and/or systemic disease. With only about 100 cultivable strains out of the over 700 oral microbiota taxa <xref rid="pone.0109061-Malamud1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, DpnI enrichment may provide a reliable way to identify novel bacterial species present in saliva using NGS. For example, <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, a strain known to be involved in periodontitis <xref rid="pone.0109061-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> was enriched 27-fold over input (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109061.s006">Table S1</xref>). <italic>Treponema denticola</italic>, another strain implicated in periodontitis <xref rid="pone.0109061-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, was undetectable in the input fraction but had over 300 associated reads in the bound fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109061.s006">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>DpnI is unique in that it is a methyl-directed type II enzyme that can be used as a tool to bind DNA of a broad clade of widely studied bacteria with impacts on human health. Our demonstration that DpnII, a methyl <italic>inhibited</italic> type II endonuclease can also be used for differential selection of DNA opens the door to using alternative enzymes for DNA segregation. Over 300 restriction endonucleases with methyl-specific recognition specificities have been catalogued <xref rid="pone.0109061-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> potentially offering many more opportunities to discriminate genomes based on methylation patterns. By choosing restriction endonucleases with different methylation specificities, we envision the ability to stratify complex genomic mixtures into various methylomes, thus simplifying the experimental characterization of any microbiome.</p><p>The discovery of restriction endonucleases enabled the biotech revolution. These enzymes now offer a new technical utility, expanding on their natural role as discriminators of their own genomes to allow isolation of genomes from unculturable bacterial genomes present at low levels from diverse hosts and environments. Careful consideration of 6 mA, 4mC and 5mC directed or blocked endonucleases has led us to use these molecular biological tools in new ways and to develop new methodologies that promise additional insights into the natural and pathogenic microbiomes of our world.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109061.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>NGS coverage maps for </bold><bold><italic>Aeromonas salmonicida</italic></bold><bold>.</bold> NGS reads from the creek input (orange) and bound (blue) fractions were mapped to <italic>Aeromonas salmonicida</italic>, grouped into 1000 nt bins and plotted.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0109061.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109061.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p><bold>DpnII efficiently binds to human DNA and excludes </bold><bold><italic>E. coli</italic></bold><bold> DNA.</bold> (A) Equal amounts of human and <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA were combined and separated with immobilized DpnII.
