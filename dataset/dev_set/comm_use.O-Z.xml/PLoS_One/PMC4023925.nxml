Dengue virus infection may be asymptomatic or lead to undifferentiated fever, dengue fever with or without warning signs, or severe dengue. Lower respiratory symptoms are unusual and lung-imaging data in patients with dengue are scarce.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>To evaluate lung changes associated with dengue infection, we retrospectively analyzed 2,020 confirmed cases of dengue. Twenty-nine of these patients (11 females and 18 males aged 16&#x02013;90 years) underwent chest computed tomography (CT), which yielded abnormal findings in 17 patients: 16 patients had pleural effusion (the sole finding in six patients) and 11 patients had pulmonary abnormalities. Lung parenchyma involvement ranged from subtle to moderate unilateral and bilateral abnormalities. The most common finding was ground-glass opacity in eight patients, followed by consolidation in six patients. Less common findings were airspace nodules (two patients), interlobular septal thickening (two patients), and peribronchovascular interstitial thickening (one patient). Lung histopathological findings in four fatal cases showed thickening of the alveolar septa, hemorrhage, and interstitial edema.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In this largest series involving the use of chest CT to evaluate lung involvement in patients with dengue, CT findings of lower respiratory tract involvement were uncommon. When abnormalities were present, pleural effusion was the most frequent finding and lung involvement was often mild or moderate and bilateral. Extensive lung abnormalities are infrequent even in severe disease and when present should lead physicians to consider other diagnostic possibilities.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>D&#x02019;Or Institute for Research and Education has supported the work.

Rapid expansion of the numbers of cases and countries affected by the disease has been observed in recent years, rendering dengue the most significant re-emerging infectious disease, especially in tropical and subtropical regions <xref rid="pone.0096313-Guzman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Recently, it was estimated there to be 390 million dengue infections per year, of which 96 million manifest apparently (any level of clinical or sub-clinical severity) <xref rid="pone.0096313-Bhatt1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The global resurgence of dengue is thought to be due to many factors, including failure to control <italic>Aedes</italic> populations, uncontrolled urbanization, population growth, climate change, and an increasing number of international travelers <xref rid="pone.0096313-Kyle1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>In the Americas, the disease resurged after the 1980s, with cyclical outbreaks occurring every 3&#x02013;5 years <xref rid="pone.0096313-SanMartn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In past years, dengue outbreaks in Brazil entailed at least 1 million cases. Dengue virus (DEN)-3 was formerly the predominant circulating serotype, but the renewed circulation of DEN-2 and DEN-4 has led to an increase in severe dengue (SD) cases, which has imposed significant challenges to the health system, including resource allocation and the early identification and clinical management of severe cases <xref rid="pone.0096313-Suaya1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>A new classification of severity levels was recently proposed by a panel of experts and adopted in the World Health Organization (WHO) dengue guidelines <xref rid="pone.0096313-World1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This classification suggests a distinction between dengue and SD, with the presence of severe organ dysfunction serving as one SD criterion. Studies of dengue have produced controversial results with respect to lung involvement. Dengue viral antigens have been demonstrated in lung tissue in experimental infection and autopsy specimens, and the virus appears to potentially infect macrophages and lung endothelial and epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0096313-Jessie1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096313-BasliodeOliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, analyses of the clinical spectrum of lung affection are scare and limited to case reports, and little overall information on chest imaging findings is available <xref rid="pone.0096313-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096313-Marchiori1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In this study, we evaluated the frequency and pattern of thoracic involvement in serologically confirmed dengue using chest computed tomography (CT), compared the imaging features of dengue fever (DF) and SD, and evaluated autopsy specimens from four patients who died with the disease. To our knowledge, this study is the first systematic examination of chest CT features in this population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Our institutional clinical research ethics board (Comit&#x000ea; de &#x000c9;tica em Pesquisa Hospital Copa D&#x02019;Or) approved this retrospective study, for which the informed consent requirement was waived.

Diagnoses of dengue fulfilled the WHO case definitions <xref rid="pone.0096313-World1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and were confirmed by immunoglobulin M (IgM) positivity. Patients who did not receive reference test diagnoses or refused blood sampling, and those for whom inappropriate or insufficient material was available or serological findings were indeterminate, were excluded. Clinical data were collected retrospectively using a standardized case report form that included demographic and epidemiologic data, clinical presentation, laboratory data, time course of acute illness, need for intensive care, and in-hospital mortality.</p><p>Cases were classified according to the 2009 WHO guidelines <xref rid="pone.0096313-World1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> as DF, dengue with warning signs, or SD. Warning signs were abdominal pain/tenderness, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation (pleural effusion [PE] or ascites), mucosal bleeding, liver enlargement, and increased hematocrit concurrent with a rapid decrease in the platelet count. The criteria for SD were: severe plasma leakage; severe bleeding; severe organ involvement, comprising hepatic injury (aspartate [AST] or alanine transaminase [ALT] level &#x02265;1000 units/L) and/or renal impairment (serum creatinine increase of 100% over baseline or calculated norm for age/sex/race); and/or impaired consciousness. Patients with no warning sign or criterion for SD were classified as having DF <xref rid="pone.0096313-World1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Blood indices were tabulated and then categorized on the basis of clinically meaningful cutoff values. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count &#x0003c;150,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> blood. A hematocrit value &#x0003e;48% was considered to be elevated. Leucopenia was defined as a white blood cell count &#x0003c;4000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. ALT levels &#x0003e;55 and &#x0003e;33 IU/L and AST levels &#x0003e;46 and &#x0003e;32 IU/L for males and females, respectively, were defined as elevated.

Studies were performed using standard and high-resolution algorithms. Initial chest CT examinations selected to assign CT lesion scores were performed 2&#x02013;21 (median, 5; mean, 5.8) days after the onset of clinical symptoms.

All images were reviewed at a window width and level of 1400 and &#x02013;650 HU, respectively, for lung parenchyma, and 300 and 35 HU, respectively, for mediastinum. The readers recorded the presence of consolidation, ground-glass opacity (GGO), airspace nodules, interlobular septal thickening, and peribronchovascular interstitial thickening. These qualitative descriptions of CT findings were based on the recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee of the Fleischner Society <xref rid="pone.0096313-Hansell1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis is based on clinical findings, a history of direct or indirect exposure of mucous membranes or abraded skin to infected animals or their urine, in endemic areas, especially in the context of urban floods or other immersion in contaminated water, and positive serologic tests <xref rid="pone.0096313-vonRanke1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096313-Marchiori3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096313-Marchiori4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In patients living or having traveled in endemic areas, malaria should be considered as a possible cause of respiratory failure of obscure etiology. Parasites may be detected on thick and thin peripheral blood smears. Thick smear examination facilitates the quantification of parasitemia <xref rid="pone.0096313-vonRanke1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>This study has some limitations. As a retrospective study, the CT indications were based on clinical manifestations and not on previously established criteria, which could have led to the underestimation of the prevalence of respiratory system involvement in this series. Despite the limitations inherent to retrospective studies, our series included a large number of patients with serologically confirmed disease and is the first original study to use CT for the assessment of pulmonary involvement in such patients.</p><p>In conclusion, dengue has become very prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, affecting hundreds of thousands people in large urban areas. Lung abnormalities are infrequent in dengue and CT findings probably reflect increased vascular permeability. Extensive pulmonary involvement is related to severe forms of the disease and should lead physicians to consider other diagnostic possibilities, even during dengue outbreaks.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Emerson Cicilini Mesquita and Debora Lima for their technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0096313-Guzman1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Guzman</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Halstead</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Artsob</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Buchy</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Farrar</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2010</year>) <article-title>Dengue: a continuing global threat</article-title>. <source>Nat Rev Microbiol</source><volume>8</volume>: <fpage>S7</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>16</lpage><comment>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro2460">10.1038/nrmicro2460</ext-link></comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21079655</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0096313-Bhatt1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bhatt</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gething</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Brady</surname><given-names>OJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Messina</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Farlow</surname><given-names>AW</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2013</year>) <article-title>The global distribution and burden of dengue</article-title>. <source>Nature</source><volume>496</volume>: <fpage>504</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>507</lpage><comment>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12060">10.1038/nature12060</ext-link></comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23563266</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0096313-Kyle1"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Kyle</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name> (<year>2008</year>) <article-title>Global spread and persistence of dengue</article-title>. <source>Annu Rev Microbiol</source><volume>62</volume>: <fpage>71</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>92</lpage><comment>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.micro.62.081307.163005">10.1146/annurev.micro.62.081307.163005</ext-link></comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18429680</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0096313-SanMartn1"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>San Mart&#x000ed;n</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Brathwaite</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zambrano</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sol&#x000f3;rzano</surname><given-names>JO</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bouckenooghe</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2010</year>) <article-title>The epidemiology of dengue in the americas over the last three decades: a worrisome reality</article-title>. <source>Am J Trop Med Hyg</source><volume>82</volume>: <fpage>128</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>135</lpage><comment>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.2010.09-0346">10.4269/ajtmh.2010.09-0346</ext-link></comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20065008</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0096313-Suaya1"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Suaya</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shepard</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Siqueira</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Martelli</surname><given-names>CT</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lum</surname><given-names>LC</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2009</year>) <article-title>Cost of dengue cases in eight countries in the Americas and Asia: a prospective study</article-title>. <source>Am J Trop Med Hyg</source><volume>80</volume>: <fpage>846</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>855</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19407136</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0096313-World1"><label>6</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">World Health Organization (2009) Dengue: guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control.
