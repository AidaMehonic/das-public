Although the functions of mouse Adar2 and its biologically most important substrate <italic>gria2</italic>, encoding the GluA2 subunit of AMPA (&#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor, have been extensively studied, the substrates and functions of zebrafish Adar2 remain elusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Principal Findings</title><p>Expression of Adar2 was perturbed in the <italic>adar2</italic> morphant (<italic>adar2MO</italic>), generated by antisense morpholio oligonucleotides. The Q/R editing of <italic>gria2&#x003b1;</italic> was reduced in the <italic>adar2MO</italic> and was enhanced by overexpression of Adar2, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved activity between zebrafish and mammalian Adar2 in editing the Q/R site of <italic>gria2</italic>. To delineate the role of Q/R editing of <italic>gria2&#x003b1;</italic> in the developmental defects observed in the <italic>adar2MO</italic>, the Q/R editing of <italic>gria2&#x003b1;</italic> was specifically perturbed in the <italic>gria2&#x003b1;QRMO</italic>, generated by a morpholio oligonucleotide complementary to the exon complementary sequence (ECS) required for the Q/R editing. Analogous to the <italic>adar2-</italic>deficient and Q/R-editing deficient mice displaying identical neurological defects, the <italic>gria2&#x003b1;QRMO</italic> and <italic>adar2MO</italic> displayed identical developmental defects in the nervous system and cranial cartilages. Knockdown <italic>p53</italic> abolished apoptosis and partially suppressed the loss of spinal cord motor neurons in these morphants. However, reducing p53 activity neither replenished the brain neuronal populations nor rescued the developmental defects. The expressions of <italic>crestin</italic> and <italic>sox9b</italic> in the neural crest cells were reduced in the <italic>adar2MO</italic> and <italic>gria2&#x003b1;QRMO</italic>. Overexpressing the edited GluA2&#x003b1;<sup>R</sup> in the <italic>adar2MO</italic> restored normal expressions of <italic>cresting</italic> and <italic>sox9b</italic>. Moreover, overexpressing the unedited GluA2&#x003b1;<sup>Q</sup> in the wild type embryos resulted in reduction of <italic>crestin</italic> and <italic>sox9b</italic> expressions. These results argue that an elevated GluA2&#x003b1;<sup>Q</sup> level is sufficient for generating the cranial neural crest defects observed in the <italic>adar2MO</italic>.

On the other hand, the gria2&#x003b1;QRMO, in which the Q/R editing of gria2&#x003b1; was specifically blocked by QRMO paired to the intronic ECS, displays almost an identical spectrum of morphological and developmental changes in the nervous system and cranial cartilages as that of adar2MO. These changes vary slightly in severity but involve identical regions of the brain, spinal cord and head cartilages at matching stages. The highly similar phenotypic changes of zebrafish adar2MO and gria2&#x003b1;QRMO are suggestive that the same function/pathway is perturbed in these animals. Reminiscing to that GluA2<sup>Q</sup> is attributed to the similar neurological changes observed in the adar2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and gria2<sup>+/&#x00394;ECS</sup> mice <xref rid="pone.0097133-Higuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097133-Brusa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, it is highly plausible that an elevated level of GluA2&#x003b1;<sup>Q</sup> accounts for a majority, if not all, of the defects in adar2MO. This possibility is supported by the observations that overexpressing the GluA2&#x003b1;<sup>R</sup> can restore the expression patterns of crestin and sox9b in the adar2MOt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097133-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>) and overexpressing the GluA2&#x003b1;<sup>Q</sup> induces wild type embryos to display neural crest defects as those observed in adar2MOt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097133-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). These observations unequivocally demonstrate that an increase of GluA2&#x003b1;<sup>Q</sup> level is sufficient to render the neural crest defect. Although that elevated GluA2&#x003b1;<sup>Q</sup> is responsible for the impaired development of the nervous system in the adar2MO has not been fully proven in this study, this possibility is consistent to the reported GluA2<sup>Q</sup> effects on neuronal death and neuronal activities <xref rid="pone.0097133-Higuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097133-Brusa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097133-Hideyama1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097133-Seeburg1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097133-Kwak1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

Overexpressing the Adar2 suppresses apoptosis in the adar2MO, demonstrating that reducing the Adar2 activity leads to apoptosis in the adar2-expressing cells/tissues. Excessive apoptosis has also been observed in the adar1-expression tissues of adar1-deficient mouse <xref rid="pone.0097133-Hartner1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097133-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

Therefore, excessive apoptosis alone could not fully account for the developmental abnormalities observed in the hypo-Q/R-editing mutants. Decoupling cell death and developmental defects is not uncommon.

There is a good correlation between brain regions showing excessive apoptosis and reduced neuronal populations, implying that apoptosis and impaired development are induced by a common mechanism in the hypo-Q/R-editing morphants.

Why do the phenotypes of adar2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse and zebrafish adar2MO differ while editing of the same substrate, namely the Q/R site of gria2/gria2&#x003b1;, is involved in both animals?

Since migration of PLL neuromasts and neural crest cells are affected by hypo-Q/R editing, the unedited GluA2&#x003b1;<sup>Q</sup> may exert novel activities on the maintenance, differentiation and/or migration of neurons and cranial neural crest in the zebrafish through increasing the activity of GluA2-containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs <xref rid="pone.0097133-Sommer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097133-Seeburg1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

Many of the developmental defects and excessive cell death in the adar2MO are most likely resulted from elevating the unedited gria2&#x003b1;<sup>Q</sup> level. Mouse Adar2 is known to edit a plethora of RNA sequences including protein-coding and non-protein coding sequences, as well as miRNA <xref rid="pone.0097133-Nishikura1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097133-Heale1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Not surprisingly, other phenotypic changes and an alternation in the transcriptome have been described in the adar2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/gria2<sup>R/R</sup> mouse that carry chromosome-encoded gria2<sup>R</sup> to suppress the neurological defects and lethality resulted from the adar2-deficient. These changes are not related to the Q/R editing of gria2 and are attributed as direct and indirect consequences of altering RNA editing activity <xref rid="pone.0097133-Horsch1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Among the few gene expression reported here, the adar2 and neuroD mRNA levels in the adar2MO and gria2&#x003b1;QRMO are differentially affected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097133-t001">Table 1</xref>). Transcriptome changes in the adar2MO may arise from the consequences of elevated GluA2&#x003b1;<sup>Q</sup>, namely the developmental defects and cell death reported here, or functions unrelated to gria2&#x003b1; editing. Moreover, the similar but not identical spatiotemporal expression patterns of adar2 and gria2&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097133-g001">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097133.s001">S1</xref>) suggest that cells affected by adar2 knockdown (adar2MO) and by reducing Q/R editing of gria2&#x003b1; (gria2&#x003b1;QRMO) may not be the same. Given the highly similar phenotypes between the adar2MO and gria2&#x003b1;QRMO, we speculate that cells/tissues of the same lineages, but may not be at the same differentiation stage, are affected in these hypo-Q/R-editing morphants during embryogenesis. Therefore, the development and/or survival of neuroD-expressing neuroblast cells may be more severely affected in the adar2MO than those in the gria2&#x003b1;QRMO, resulting in a significant decrease of neuroD expression in the adar2MO. Similarly, decrease adar2 level may also be resulted from excessive cell death in the adar2-expressing cells in the adar2MO (Table1). These possibilities are consistent with our observation that p53 inactivation enhances the adar2 and neuroD levels in the adar2MOt (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097133-t001">Table 1</xref>). Degradation of the improperly spliced adar2 pre-mRNA further reduces the adar2 level in the adar2MOsp. The reduction of gria2&#x003b1; expression in the adar2MO may be a combined effect of inefficient splicing of unedited gria2&#x003b1;<sup>Q</sup> pre-mRNA and abnormal differentiation/cell death of gria2&#x003b1; and adar2 co-expressing cells. The relatively high variability of the gria2&#x003b1; levels in the adar2MO, when compared with that of gria2&#x003b1;QRMO (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097133-t001">Table 1</xref>), may reflect the defective differentiation/cell death of gria2&#x003b1;-expressing cells is influenced not only by the elevated GluA2&#x003b1;<sup>Q</sup> but also by other, possibly more chaotic, factors in the adar2MO. Similarly, the levels of gira1&#x003b1;, encoding AMPAR subunit GluA1a and frequently co-expressed with gria2&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0097133-Hoppmann1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, also show high variability in the adar2MO, but the levels of gria1&#x003b1; correlated well with gria2&#x003b1; in each independent treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097133-t001">Table 1</xref>).
