Here we examine whether postganglionic sympathetic neurons are able to mobilize Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores in response to depolarization, independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. We measured changes in cytosolic &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> in individual fluo-4 &#x02013;loaded sympathetic ganglion neurons in response to maintained K<sup>+</sup> depolarization in the presence (2 mM) and absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>). Progressive elevations in extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> caused increasing membrane depolarizations that were of similar magnitude in 0 and 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. Peak amplitude of &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> transients in 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> increased in a linear fashion as the membrane become more depolarized. Peak elevations of &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> in 0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> were ~5&#x02013;10% of those evoked at the same membrane potential in 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> and exhibited an inverse U-shaped dependence on voltage. Both the rise and decay of &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> transients in 0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> were slower than those of &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> transients evoked in 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. Rises in &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> evoked by high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> were blocked by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase, or the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonists 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and xestospongin C, but not by extracellular Cd<sup>2+</sup>, the dihydropyridine antagonist nifedipine, or by ryanodine at concentrations that caused depletion of ryanodine-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. These results support the notion that postganglionic sympathetic neurons possess the ability to release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive internal stores in response to membrane depolarization, independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81202509, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/">http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/</ext-link>) to HS and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (R01HL07165, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/</ext-link>) to MR.

Neurons use both extracellular and intracellular sources of calcium. Whereas voltage-gated calcium channels and receptor-operated channels such as the NMDA receptors enable Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the extracellular space, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptors and ryanodine receptors distributed throughout the endoplasmic reticulum membrane are responsible for releasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from its internal stores [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The mechanism for triggering Ca<sup>2+</sup> discharge from internal stores is unknown in some cases, and it is often assumed that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release secondary to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is the prevailing mechanism underlying Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization. More recent studies, however, provide evidence for the existence of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-independent, voltage-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanism in neurons. A skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling&#x02013;like mechanism, wherein conformational changes of the dihydropyridine receptor directly gate the ryanodine receptor, has been reported for hippocampal neurons [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], hypothalamic magnocellular neurons [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and ischemically injured spinal cord white matter [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the other hand, voltage-induced, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-independent, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release form IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive stores has been reported for insect dorsal unpaired median neurons [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Overall, these studies suggest the possibility that voltage-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores may be a more general phenomenon in neurons than previously thought.</p><p>Sympathetic ganglion neurons have been demonstrated to express both dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type calcium channels [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and ryanodine receptors [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], suggesting the possibility that a skeletal muscle-like, voltage-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release occurs in these cells. Here, we tested the hypothesis that sympathetic ganglion neurons in adult mice possess the ability to mobilize Ca<sup>2+</sup> from internal stores in response to membrane depolarization, independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Our results provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence that postganglionic sympathetic neurons are capable of releasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from internal stores in response to prolonged depolarization in the absence of extracellular calcium. Surprisingly, however, this process does not require dihydropyridine or ryanodine receptors. Rather, depolarization causes Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive internal stores, utilizing a yet to be identified plasmalemmal voltage sensor. This process may constitute a novel mechanism coupling electrical activity to a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in sympathetic neurons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Preparation of sympathetic neurons</title><p>Sympathetic neurons were prepared in a manner previously described [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. DBA/J mice at 2 to 3 months of age were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The superior and stellate ganglia were removed under stereomicroscopy and immediately placed in chilled (4&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C) sympathetic complete medium [DME-F12 medium supplemented with sodium bicarbonate, HEPES, penicillin/streptomycin, 5% fetal bovine serum, and MITO<sup>+</sup> Serum extender (Collaborative Res, Bedford, MA, USA)]. The ganglia were then incubated for 20 min at 37&#x000b0;C in a Earle&#x02019;s Balanced Salt solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10 U/ml papain (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ, USA), followed by a 30-min incubation in Earle&#x02019;s Balanced Salt solution supplemented with 1.3 mg/ml type II collagenase (Worthington) and 2.2 mg/ml dispase II (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA).

Cells were loaded at room temperature with fluo-4 by incubation with the acetoxymethyl (AM) ester form of the dye (fluo-4/AM; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) at a final concentration of 2 &#x003bc;M in normal Tyrode&#x02019;s solution. After 20 min, cells were washed several times with dye-free Tyrode&#x02019;s solution and transferred to an inverted microscope (Axioscope) equipped with a Zeiss x63 1.4 numerical aperture water immersion lens. The microscope was attached to a confocal laser-scanning unit (Zeiss LSM 510). Fluo-4 fluorescence was probed every second by illumination with 488-nm laser light and emission was detected between 500 and 550 nm. The diameter of the pinhole was set to its maximum for all measurements. Images were taken in frame-mode at a pixel density of 512 x 512. Fluorescence signals were digitized at 8-bit resolution and analyzed using Metamorph software (Molecular Probes, Sunnyvale, CA). To quantitate amplitude and time course of changes in cytosolic fluo-4 fluorescence, i.e., Ca<sup>2+</sup>, signal intensities of pixels located inside the neuron soma (excluding the nuclei) were measured, spatially averaged, and background corrected [F(t)]. Background fluorescence was measured as the average of a 40 x 40 pixel cell-free area outside the neuron soma of interest in each frame of every time series. Baseline fluorescence intensity (F<sub>0</sub>) was determined by averaging F over the 10-s interval preceding the cell&#x02019;s exposure to elevated [K<sup>+</sup>] in the extracellular medium ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>), and the time course of normalized fractional dye fluorescence [&#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub>(t)] was obtained, where &#x00394;F equals F(t)- F<sub>0</sub>. Signal correction for bleaching was not necessary.</p><p>Cells were exposed to a high [K<sup>+</sup>] solution (40, 60, 80 or 100 mM KCl) in the presence of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> for 30 s, followed by a 1-min exposure to normal Tyrode&#x02019;s solution. A second 30-s exposure to the same [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (with 200 &#x003bc;M EGTA added to the extracellular solution) was applied, and then the high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> solution was replaced with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free normal Tyrode&#x02019;s solution. The first and second applications of high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> were separated by 3-min exposures to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free normal Tyrode&#x02019;s solution. Bath solution exchanges were performed via manual injections (~500 &#x003bc;l/s) through the input port of the perfusion chamber. For each consecutive bath fluid exchange in the experimental protocol, the injected volume was 7 ml, corresponding to ~27 times the chamber volume. Solution changes were rapid, based on the fast and steady change in membrane potential achieved when cells were exposed to external solutions with elevated [K<sup>+</sup>] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148962.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

Alternatively, the insensitivity of whole-cell <italic>I</italic><sub>Ba</sub> to inhibition by nifedipine may suggest that adult sympathetic ganglion neurons express the skeletal muscle isoform of the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel which has been shown previously to require nearly 50 &#x003bc;M nifedipine for complete block [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We found that pretreating neurons for 20 min with a high concentration of nifedipine (50 &#x003bc;M) spared the high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses both in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148962.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). The lack of a significant effect of nifedipine on the magnitude of depolarization-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the presence of normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> is consistent with the notion that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels does not contribute noticeably to the rise in global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in our study.

Further, a skeletal muscle excitation-contraction&#x02013;like mechanism as reported previously for hypothalamic magnocellular neurons, ischemically injured spinal cord white matter, and hippocampal neurons, can be excluded as the mechanism underlying depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the other hand, our findings are similar to those reported previously by Ryglewski et al. demonstrating that insect dorsal unpaired median neurons are capable of transducing incremental depolarization into gradual increases in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], involving Ca<sup>2+</sup>- influx-independent activation of a G protein-phospholipase C-IP<sub>3</sub> receptor pathway. However, the nature of the voltage sensor was not identified in the latter study [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Na-induced dissociation of G-protein subunits has been demonstrated previously in neurons [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], suggesting the possibility that high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization from IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive stores as seen in the present study involves an ion influx-dependent, but not strictly depolarization-dependent, mechanism. Specifically, Na<sup>+</sup> permeation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the absence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> is one possible pathway linking Ca<sup>2+</sup> release to membrane depolarization in our experimental conditions. We think this possibility to be unlikely for several reasons. First, extracellular Cd<sup>2+</sup> at concentrations that completely blocked inward currents through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, did not suppress high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>-[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transients in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Second, we did not detect resolvable inward currents through voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in voltage-clamped, depolarized neurons upon removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Third, high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free bath solutions could be readily evoked in the presence of 1 mM extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which corresponds to 4 times the IC<sub>50</sub> of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced block of Na<sup>+</sup> current through N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the major subtype of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in adult sympathetic ganglion neurons.</p><p>Also, ions other than Ca<sup>2+</sup> can enter the cell via alternative voltage-modulated pathways, e.g., voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels, or voltage-independent pathways, e.g., acetylcholine receptor and/or transient receptor potential cation channels. The gradual decrease in Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in the bath solution for increasingly large depolarizations results in an incremental reduction in the Na<sup>+</sup> driving force, progressively reducing its flux through voltage-independent channels as the membrane becomes more depolarized. This behavior conflicts with the non-monotonic dependence of depolarization-evoked peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> amplitude on voltage that we observed in the absence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148962.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). It thus appears unlikely that the magnitude of Na<sup>+</sup> movement through voltage-independent pathways constitutes the trigger for Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in our experiments. Because the relationship between changes in membrane potential and those in extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration followed the Nernst equation with a slope close to that expected for a K<sup>+</sup>-selective ion channel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148962.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), the K<sup>+</sup> net flux at each membrane potential achieved with various [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> must have been zero or close to zero, excluding voltage-dependent changes in transmembrane K<sup>+</sup> flux as a possible regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in 0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>.</p><p>Finally<sub>,</sub> the possibility that the voltage-dependence of peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> magnitude in the absence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> reflects the voltage-dependence of a steady-state current through voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels has to be considered. Previous studies by others revealed the existence of a non-inactivating component of the Na<sup>+</sup> current in neurons [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], whose magnitude exhibits a non-monotonic, U-shaped, dependence on voltage. However, these persistent, so-called &#x02018;window&#x02019; Na<sup>+</sup> currents activated at voltages significantly more negative than those of peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> in 0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, making persistent Na<sup>+</sup> currents an unlikely candidate linking Ca<sup>2+</sup> discharge to membrane voltage changes. Overall, our results thus support the notion that depolarization <italic>per se</italic> suffices to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> discharge from IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive stores in 0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e.</sub></p><p>The inverse U-shaped dependence of peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> amplitude on membrane potential in 0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> is both unexpected and puzzling. Because peak <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>act</italic></sub> of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels steeply increases with depolarization over the range of membrane potentials we studied, we can exclude the possibility that gating changes as are typically achieved during peak activation of these channels, underlie voltage-induced, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in our experiments. However, the observed non-monotonic behavior of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal strength with increasing depolarization is compatible with a mechanism, wherein the voltage-dependence of a channel&#x02019;s steady-state, but not peak, <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>act</italic></sub> serves to transduce prolonged changes in membrane potential into graded Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization. Indeed, our numerical simulations using experimentally determined activation and inactivation properties of voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels demonstrate that the channel&#x02019;s voltage-dependence of steady-state <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>act</italic></sub> on membrane potential overlaps with that of peak &#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub> magnitude measured in 0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. Direct proof of the role of conformational changes of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel complex in tuning Ca<sup>2+</sup> discharge from IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive internal stores will require experimental immobilization of gating charges in subtypes of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels known to be expressed in adult sympathetic ganglion neurons, including N- and P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. It will also require measurements of absolute free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels. Because we have not calibrated the fluo-4 signal for our experimental conditions, we were unable to directly correlate changes in membrane potential to those in free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.</p><p>Besides voltage-gated ion channels, it is possible that non-ion channel proteins act as voltage sensors, e.g., the Na-K ATPase, the Na-Ca exchanger or the recently discovered voltage-sensitive phosphatide phosphatase, although expression of the latter in mammalian neuronal tissue has not yet been confirmed [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additional studies are needed to identify the molecule capable of transducing the electrical signal into Ca<sup>2+</sup> discharge from IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive stores in adult sympathetic neurons.</p><p>It was demonstrated previously that insect dorsal unpaired median neurons possess a membrane voltage sensor that, independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, causes G-protein activation, which subsequently leads to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores via phospholipase C and IP<sub>3</sub>-receptor activation [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It remains to be determined whether the voltage-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanism in our study utilizes the same signaling pathway or whether the plasmalemmal voltage-sensor directly interacts with the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor in the ER membrane. The slow rise in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] during prolonged depolarizations in the absence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> suggests the involvement of intermediary steps in transducing the electrical signal into a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intercellular stores. Moreover, dihydropyridine receptors have previously been reported to act as voltage sensors for a voltage-dependent, IP<sub>3</sub> receptor-mediated, slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in skeletal muscle cells [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A model was proposed in which the dihydropyridine receptor decodes the electrical signal into G-protein-dependent activation of phospholipase C to produce IP<sub>3</sub>, which then diffuses to IP<sub>3</sub> receptors located on the ER and nuclear membrane, ultimately activating intracellular signaling cascades. Although our experiments provide no evidence for a role of dihydropyridine receptors as voltage-sensors in depolarization-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in sympathetic ganglion neurons, our data suggests that both cell types share the signaling events downstream of their respective voltage-sensor.</p><p>Although 2-APB has been shown previously to inhibit IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in neurons [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], it also exerts unspecific effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in non-excitable cell types, e.g. via blockade of cation-selective channels encoded by the by transient receptor potential (TRP) genes [<xref rid="pone.0148962.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
