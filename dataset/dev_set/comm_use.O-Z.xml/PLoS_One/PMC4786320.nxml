Spermatozoa are a type of polarized and specified cell. Unlike somatic cells, spermatozoa have only a minimal amount of cytosol and lack organelles that contain the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, peroxisomes and ribosomes [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151254.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This structure makes spermatozoa a preferable model for thremmatology research. The fundamental biomolecules of spermatozoon include different proteins that are intricately related to many biological functions such as integrality, fertilization and spermatozoon mobility. More recent proteomics research has used mass spectrometry to analyze and characterize the sperm proteome [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, thus far, sperm proteome analyses have not been widely reported.</p><p>The motility and fertility of mature spermatozoa originate during spermatogenesis. During the period of spermatogenesis, immature spermatids turn into mature spermatozoa through a series of external and intrinsic changes in structure. The most obvious morphological characteristic is the appearance of a flagellum that can be used to effectively distinguish oval spermatids from mature spermatozoa. Despite the important role of spermatogenesis in the spermatozoa fertilization of teleost fish, the species-specific cellular, molecular and biochemical mechanisms remain unknown [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151254.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>bouderius</italic> is a rare cultured catfish from south China, and its captive breeding is incipient. The potential commercial value of this species warrants further research on its reproduction. Spermatogenesis and spermioteleosis play key roles in reproduction, and the differences between mature and immature sperm might provide useful information for understanding these processes. In the present study, a proteomics approach was used to perform proteomic profiling of the spermatogenesis of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>bouderius</italic>. We investigated the mature and immature sperm proteins using a non-gel-based quantitative proteomics technique termed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). This approach can be used to precisely qualify and quantify different proteins and to explore potential protein interactions [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is the first time that the iTRAQ-based proteomics approach has been used for the catfish sperm proteome. This information is valuable for understanding the molecular mechanisms of fish spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the animal ethics committee of South China Agricultural University.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>The experimental catfish (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>bouderius</italic>) were obtained from the fish hatchery of the Qingyuan North River Fishery Science Institute, Qingyuan, Guangdong, China. The fish were maintained in the recirculation system of the College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, under standard laboratory conditions until they were sampled. Tricaine methanesulfonate (MS 222) is a common anaesthetic that we used for catfish zoopery in accordance with the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Six live <italic>C</italic>. <italic>bouderius</italic> from 2 different testis developmental stages were euthanized with an overdose of MS 222 at 300 mg/L (buffered with sodium bicarbonate) for sampling.

The presence or absence of flagella was used to confirm the morphologies of the mature or immature sperm, respectively, using light microscopy. The suspension was centrifuged at 1,500 x g for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C to collect the centrifuged deposit. A millilitre of lysis buffer containing 8-M urea and 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Ltd.

The experiments were performed on a Nano Aquity UPLC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) connected to a quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an online nano-electrospray ion source. A 10-&#x003bc;L peptide sample was loaded onto the trap column (Thermo Scientific Acclaim PepMap C18, 100 &#x003bc;m x 2 cm) with a flow rate of 10 &#x003bc;L/min for 3 min and subsequently separated on an analytical column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 75 &#x003bc;m x 15 cm) with a linear gradient from 2% D to 40% D over 165 min.

The Q-Exactive mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode to switch automatically between MS and MS/MS acquisition. Survey full-scan MS spectra (m/z 350&#x02013;1200) were acquired with a mass resolution of 70K, followed by 15 sequential high energy collisional dissociation (HCD) MS/MS scans with a resolution of 17.5K.

Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 47.0% probability to achieve a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 1.0% using the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability and contained at least 2 identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the ProteinProphet Algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Proteins that contained similar peptides and that could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into clusters. For peptide identification quality control, the percolator algorithm was used to the maintain peptide FDR levels at lower than 1%. Only unique peptides were used for protein quantification, and normalization on the protein median was used to correct for experimental bias. The minimum number of proteins that must be observed was set to 100. Low scoring spectra and peptides without labelling were eliminated by filtering based on a protein FDR &#x02264; 0.01 and a peptide FDR &#x02264; 0.01 [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

A large variety of proteins are involved in this metabolic process. Because of its specific simple structure, the spermatozoa became an ideal model to investigate the proteins that are involved in spermatogenesis and spermioteleosis. Proteomics technologies offer an extraordinary opportunity to investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate sperm function. In the present study, we investigated protein variety and abundance in mature and immature spermatozoa and explored the major proteins that participate in spermatogenesis and spermioteleosis.</p><p>In the current study, a TMT-labelling quantitative proteome analysis was performed on mature and immature spermatozoa. As a result, 1,941 proteins were identified, including 361 differentially expressed proteins. All of the identified proteins were categorized into 7 subcellular localizations, 3 molecular functions and 9 biological processes. Differentially expressed proteins were distributed in the cytoplasm, membrane, nucleus, mitochondria, cytoskeleton and endoplasmic reticulum. The proteins were involved in transmembrane transporter, RNA binding and signal transduction activities, in addition to, vesicle-mediated transport, cell adhesion and nucleocytoplasmic transport activities. The differentially expressed proteins were involved in 235 different pathways. Because of the abundance of information, manual analysis of each protein and pathway was not feasible, and thus analyses that identify specific crucial proteins and functions in spermatozoa should be performed to assess their contribution to reproduction.</p><p>Energy consumption is required for the full metabolic processes of spermatogenesis and spermioteleosis. The TCA cycle is one of the crucial pathways for energy supply [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our study identified 3 different proteins that were involved in the TCA cycle, including isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH, ec: 1.1.1.41), &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (&#x003b1;-KGDHC) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, ec: 4.1.1.32). IDH and &#x003b1;-KGDHC were upregulated, and PEPCK was downregulated.</p><p>IDH and &#x003b1;-KGDHC are rate-limiting enzymes in the TCA cycle [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. NAD+ or NADP+-dependent IDH catalyses isocitrate to ketoglutarate (2-oxoglutarate) through oxidative decarboxylation, which is accompanied by the generation of CO<sub>2</sub> and NADH or NADPH [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Production of ketoglutarate cannot occur without IDH [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The &#x003b1;-KGDHC complex is composed of 3 subunits, namely, ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1), which is also designated as oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH; EC 1.2.4.2) [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2, DLST; ec: 2.3.1.61) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3, DLD; ec: 1.8.1.4) [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The &#x003b1;-KGDHC enzyme is highly regulated and determines metabolic flux through the TCA cycle. &#x003b1;-KGDHC catalyses the conversion of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, which is accompanied by the production of NADH, a process that directly provides electrons for the respiratory chain [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As a result of IDH and &#x003b1;-KGDHC activity, isocitrate is oxidatively decarboxylated to ketoglutarate and, soon afterwards, decarboxylated to succinyl-CoA, which participates in the TCA cycle [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The abundance of IDH and &#x003b1;-KGDHC in organs has a direct influence on the efficiency of oxygen oxidation and energy metabolism. Upregulation of IDH and &#x003b1;-KGDHC is indicative of a higher rate of oxygen oxidation and energy metabolism, which would enhance the physiological ability of sperm.</p><p>PEPCK is the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The metabolism of pyruvate and/or lactate is necessary for the capacitation of mammalian spermatozoa, and glucose can decrease the capacitation reaction [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Spermatozoa prefer to use pyruvate or lactate over glucose. When glucose is sufficient, most of it appears to be metabolized [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our study, the lower concentration of PCK1 may be related to the capacitation of spermatozoa; consequently, spermatozoa prefer to metabolize glucose rather than synthesis glucose. As a result, more pyruvate and/or lactate can provide sufficient energy to supply zymolyte for capacitation.</p><p>Based on the obtained data, we found that the expression of PLC&#x003b3;, PAK, Raf and GSK-3 observably changed in the ERBB signalling pathway. PLC&#x003b3;, PAK and Raf were upregulated, while GSK-3 was downregulated. The expression of each gene is involved in a crucial signalling pathway, and these 4 signalling pathways were closely related to spermatogenesis and spermioteleosis.</p><p>A calcium-dependent isotype of PLC&#x003b3; is activated during sperm capacitation [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The activation of PLC leads to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 -bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which elevates Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. The formation of IP3 and the elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels might reinforce PLC activation through the mobilization of an acrosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> pool. At the same time, the formation of DG activates specific PKC isoforms [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151254.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As a result, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel is activated on the sperm plasma membrane [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. PKC increases the intracellular pH by accelerating the Na+/H+ exchange [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The alkalization of sperm that is mediated by Na+/H+ exchange is responsible for flagellar beating [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. PKC regulation of flagellar motility was demonstrated in sea urchin and human sperm [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151254.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The mechanism of spermatozoon-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase as a conduit for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the egg cytoplasm was supported by frog and fish studies, in which sperm-derived PLC induced the generation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Based on our analysis, the regulation of PLC&#x003b3; might promote sperm motility.</p><p>P21-activated kinases (PAKs) belong to a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase family that is crucial for various signalling processes [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. One pathway that is related to the maintenance of sperm viability is the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK, also known as SAPK) pathway. In this pathway, PAK can phosphorylate the JNK activators (MKK4, also referred to as SEK1/JNKK). Biochemical studies demonstrated that the phosphorylation of MKK4 activates JNK [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The activation of JNK phosphorylates the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal activation domain of c-Jun [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] on Ser63 and Ser73, which causes the increase of c-Jun transcriptional activity [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. During the life of spermatozoa, the osmolality of the external environment usually changes dramatically. As a result, sperm probably developed a cellular defence mechanism against osmotic stress that includes the JNK pathway [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. PAK also activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades by affecting the actin and tubulin cytoskeletons, which leads to transcription and cytoskeletal structure changes [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The dysfunction of the MAPK pathway can cause spermatogenetic damage [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As the upstream regulator of the JNK and MAPK pathways, PAK is essential for sperm survival and quality. Mature spermatozoa are fully differentiated cells that lack active transcriptional machinery. Hence, upregulation of PAK that leads to JNK and MAPK cascades might be an important posttranscriptional mechanism in sperm.</p><p>Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) belong to a family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). These kinases are widely present in spermatozoa and are important for flagellar motility, hyperactivation and the acrosome reaction of mature spermatozoa [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The ERK pathway includes 3 pivotal kinases, namely Raf (as MAPK kinase kinase), MEK (as MAPK kinase), and ERK1 and 2 (as MAPK) [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Raf can be activated through a direct interaction with phosphatidic acid or can be independent from an association with Ras [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The specific phosphorylation mechanisms of MAPK cascades that are initiated by RAF have been widely reported. Raf phosphorylates the 218 and 222 serine residues of MEK [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and the latter phosphorylation leads to the activation of ERK through extreme high-specificity phosphorylation [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The mitotic proliferation of primary spermatogonia and the acquisition of sperm motility during spermatogenesis, which were attributable to the expression and activation of ERK1/2, could be observed in mice [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. On the other hand, ERK1/2 in fowl spermatozoa regulates flagellar motility by phosphorylating axonemal and/or accessory cytoskeletal proteins [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Moreover, the ERK1/2 pathway possibly exerts an effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of fibrous sheath proteins during capacitation [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore, we deduced that the upregulation of Raf would activate the ERK pathway and ultimately influence sperm motility and capacitation.</p><p>Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is related to sperm motility and is present in sperm and testis in several species [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. GSK3 exerts a severe inhibitory effect on flagellar movements by adjusting the phosphorylation levels of glucose metabolism enzymes. For example, inhibition of GSK3 activity through phosphorylation leads to a significant increase in the percentage of rapid- and medium-speed spermatozoa, as well as all sperm velocity parameters and coefficients [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. GSK3 is a critical downstream element of the PI3K/AKT1 cell survival pathway. PI3K activates a downstream kinase, which, together with PKB/Akt, leads to the deactivation of GSK3 and might contribute to capacitation [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151254.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. GSK3 also activates a mammal-specific isoform of type1 protein phosphatase (PP1&#x003b3;2). PP1&#x003b3;2 is specifically expressed in sperm and testis, and it is an indispensable enzyme in the acquisition and regulation of sperm motility [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Mouse sperm with GSK3 knocked out demonstrates an elevation in the catalytic activity of PP1&#x003b3;2 [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. As a result, the downregulation of GSK3 that was observed in our study may correspond to an elevation in sperm motility during capacitation.</p><p>Increasing evidence shows that spermatozoa are a potentially useful model to investigate reproductive control in general. Proteomics represents an extraordinary tool for evaluating the molecular mechanisms regulating sperm function. The development of contraceptive vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and diagnoses of sperm dysfunction, asthenozoosperm or fertilization failure using proteomics have been carried out in clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151254.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In the present study, we compared the differentially expressed proteins between the mature and immature sperm of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>bouderius</italic>. We analysed the subcellular localization, molecular function and biological processes of differentially expressed proteins and deduced the potential functions of crucial proteins in specific signalling pathways. Protein data derived from proteomic approaches are valuable for evaluating the exact mechanisms of the specific proteins that control fertility. Western blotting or qPCR may be better for revealing the expression levels of these important proteins, as the results of our study suggest that iTRAQ may not be optimal. However, the data we obtained is sufficient to indicate that some key differentially expressed proteins could affect spermatogenesis and spermioteleosis. The identified proteins should be strictly evaluated in subsequent studies to verify their specific functions in spermatozoa, was well as their role in reproduction. Moreover, confounding factors that can affect proteomics data should also be considered when translating the discoveries from proteomic analyses into clinical trial research and practice. Taken together, the results of the present study may provide new avenues for the management of male reproduction in general and novel targets for expected reproductive outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151254.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Data of VolcanoPlot.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151254.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work received the support of the Ocean Fishery Science and Technology and Industry Development of Guangdong Province (A201501A02, A201301F03), the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province (2015A020209126), Innovation Fund for Technology based Firms of MOST (14C26214402655).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0151254.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Brewis</surname><given-names>IA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gadella</surname><given-names>BM</given-names></name>. <article-title>Sperm surface proteomics: from protein lists to biological function</article-title>. <source>Mol Hum Reprod</source>. <year>2010</year>;<volume>16</volume>: <fpage>68</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>79</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gap077">10.1093/molehr/gap077</ext-link></comment>
