The lexical data have been subsequently analyzed with the aid of the principal phylogenetic methods, both distance-based and character-based: Starling neighbor joining (StarlingNJ), Neighbor joining (NJ), Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA), Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Unweighted maximum parsimony (UMP). Cognation indexes within the input matrix were marked by two different algorithms: traditional etymological approach and phonetic similarity, i.e., the automatic method of consonant classes (Levenshtein distances). Due to certain reasons (first of all, high lexicographic quality of the wordlists and a consensus about the Lezgian phylogeny among Caucasologists), the Lezgian database is a perfect testing area for appraisal of phylogenetic methods. For the etymology-based input matrix, all the phylogenetic methods, with the possible exception of UMP, have yielded trees that are sufficiently compatible with each other to generate a consensus phylogenetic tree of the Lezgian lects. The obtained consensus tree agrees with the traditional expert classification as well as some of the previously proposed formal classifications of this linguistic group. Contrary to theoretical expectations, the UMP method has suggested the least plausible tree of all. In the case of the phonetic similarity-based input matrix, the distance-based methods (StarlingNJ, NJ, UPGMA) have produced the trees that are rather close to the consensus etymology-based tree and the traditional expert classification, whereas the character-based methods (Bayesian MCMC, UMP) have yielded less likely topologies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Financial support was provided by the Institute of the Middle East (Moscow).

This is the maximum number of Lezgian lects for which available lexicographic sources permit to compile a Swadesh wordlist without field work. The following languages are included in the current version of the GLD Lezgian database: Udi (2 dialects), Archi, Kryts (2 dialects), Budukh, Tsakhur (3 dialects), Rutul (3 dialects), Aghul (5 dialects), Tabasaran (2 dialects), Lezgi.

Note that despite the fact that the Swadesh wordlist is extensively used by linguists from the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, the only attempt to clarify the exact meanings of individual Swadesh items and propose semantic specifications for them was published in 2010.

This especially concerns occasional (quasi-)synonymy and regular quasi-synonymy. For example, notes on the entries &#x02018;hand&#x02019; and &#x02018;foot&#x02019; also include an obligatory discussion of expressions for &#x02018;arm&#x02019; and &#x02018;leg&#x02019; (similarly &#x02018;fog&#x02019; and &#x02018;rain cloud&#x02019; in the entry for &#x02018;cloud&#x02019;; &#x02018;hot&#x02019; in the entry for &#x02018;warm&#x02019;; &#x02018;male&#x02019; and &#x02018;husband&#x02019; in the entry for &#x02018;man&#x02019; and so on). Additionally, in notes, forms of those languages and dialects are quoted, whose lexicographic sources are insufficient for 110-item wordlist compiling (e.g., the Udi list contains the relevant lexical data from the Caucasian Albanian palimpsests).</p></list-item></list><p>In the aforementioned wordlists, cognations of individual forms were set up in two ways: etymological and phonetic similarity-based. All the described calculations have been doubled for these two options.</p><p>Firstly, cognation indexes were marked with help of <bold>traditional comparative method</bold>. I use the Proto-Lezgian reconstruction by the late Sergei Starostin ([<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) with certain corrections and improvements when necessary. S. Starostin&#x02019;s work is the only full-fledged Proto-Lezgian reconstruction which has been published so far. At the same time, the German Caucasologist Wolfgang Schulze has announced his own version of the Proto-Lezgian reconstruction ([<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). The amount of Schulze&#x02019;s etymologies for individual Lezgian roots that has already been published by the author is insufficient for any final decisions, but I must note that a significant number of Schulze&#x02019;s diachronic ideas does not look acceptable from my point of view. For example, Schulze treats inherited Udi <italic>mu&#x003c7;</italic> &#x02018;fingernail&#x02019; as a Persian loanword (actually Persian <italic>mex</italic> means 'nail, peg', not &#x02018;nail, fingernail&#x02019; and therefore it cannot be a source of borrowing, whereas the Udi word has nice etymological cognates in other Lezgian languages); the Udi verb for &#x02018;to sit&#x02019; is analyzed by Schulze as an old compound of two verbal roots, &#x02018;to come&#x02019; and &#x02018;to sit down&#x02019;, with the semantic explanation &#x02018;to sit&#x02019; &#x0003c; *&#x02018;he came and sat down&#x02019; that is typologically improbable; and so on.</p><p>The second option of marking cognation is a formal algorithm, based on <bold>phonetic similarity</bold>. There are two most popular approaches to the automatic establishing of cognate word pairs between the given wordlists: Levenshtein distances and consonant classes. In fact, the method of consonant classes may be considered a crude variation on the measurement of Levenshtein distances. Below I will rely on consonant classes (I am not aware of any publications which compare the discussed approaches and demonstrate that consonant classes yield significantly less reliable results than Levenshtein distances).</p><p>The method of consonant classes was proposed by A. Dolgopolsky in 1964 ([<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], English version: [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) and successfully tested by various authors on the data of various languages of Eurasia (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]).</p><p>This method implies that the phonetic alphabet used in our studies can be divided into several non-intersecting subsets (classes) so that phonetic mutations between the sounds of one class during natural language development are typologically more normal than mutations between sounds that belong to different classes. Typology of sound changes is not sufficiently advanced yet (but cf. [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] for progress in this area), therefore such a division can only be based on the intuition and experience of individual linguists. Below, I operate with classes currently accepted in the <italic>Global Lexicostatistical Database</italic> project (GLD) [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://starling.rinet.ru/new100/sound.pdf">http://starling.rinet.ru/new100/sound.pdf</ext-link> [Accessed 16.02.2014].

</p><p>Using this simplified transcription system (<italic>P T S Y W M N Q R K H</italic>) we can code any real wordforms or morphemes included into comparison. Note that elements of the zero-class and such features as coarticulation, prosody, phonation are deleted from the structure. Vocalic or laryngeal onsets and vocalic or laryngeal finals, however, are coded as <italic>H</italic>. Thus both hypothetical forms <italic>tasa</italic> and <italic>d&#x002b0;&#x000fc;&#x00292;o</italic> are coded as <italic>TSH</italic>; <italic>alaq</italic> and <italic>&#x002a1;&#x000e4;rx</italic> = <italic>HRK</italic>; <italic>na</italic> and <italic>&#x0014b;o&#x00294;</italic> = <italic>NH</italic>; <italic>pk&#x002b0;ot</italic> and <italic>baq&#x002bc;a&#x003b8;</italic> = <italic>PKT</italic>; <italic>wahat</italic> and <italic>&#x0028d;ad</italic> = <italic>WT</italic>. Non-initial <italic>Y</italic> and <italic>W</italic> (weak glides) are treated as <italic>H</italic>, thus <italic>ka</italic>, <italic>kay</italic>, <italic>kawa</italic> = <italic>KH</italic>, whereas <italic>kat</italic> and <italic>kayat</italic> = <italic>KT</italic>.</p><p>As follows from the above, two forms from compared languages possessing identical simplified transcriptions have a better chance to appear to be etymological cognates than forms whose simplified transcriptions differ.</p><p>All the Lezgian wordlists have been coded in this way, whereupon cognations have been automatically established in the Starling software: two forms are marked as cognates if the first two consonants in their simplified transcriptions coincide. For instance, the words for &#x02018;ashes&#x02019;: Kryts <italic>r&#x000e4;q</italic> (<italic>RK</italic>) = Aghul <italic>r&#x000fc;q&#x002d0;&#x002b8;</italic> (<italic>RK</italic>) &#x02260; Tsakhur <italic>yiq&#x002e4;-</italic> (<italic>YK</italic>) &#x02260; Archi <italic>diq&#x002bc;&#x002d0;&#x002e4;-</italic> (<italic>TK</italic>), even though in reality all the forms originate from one proto-root (i.e., from the same ancestral root of the proto-language). On the contrary, Udi <italic>kul</italic> &#x02018;hand&#x02019; (<italic>KL</italic>) = Tsakhur <italic>&#x003c7;&#x00268;l&#x002b8;</italic> &#x02018;id.&#x02019; (<italic>KL</italic>), even though these forms actually originate from different proto-roots.</p><p>For tree rooting, the 110-item wordlist of the Chechen literary language [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] has been introduced into comparison as an outgroup.

It should be remembered that the distance-based methods (StarlingNJ, NJ, BioNJ, UPGMA) are only able to produce binary trees. As for the UMP-tree, this one seriously differs from the others, see below.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All the methods suggest the three-part division of the Nuclear Lezgian sub-group: (1) proto-West Lezgian [Tsakhur, Rutul], (2) proto-South Lezgian [Kryts, Budukh], (3) proto-East Lezgian [Aghul, Tabasaran, Lezgi]. The difference is found out in the hierarchy of the splits. The StarlingNJ and NJ (Figs. <xref rid="pone.0116950.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116950.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) as well as UMP (<xref rid="pone.0116950.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) methods suggest that West Lezgian splits off first and then South Lezgian and East Lezgian bifurcate. The UPGMA method (<xref rid="pone.0116950.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) suggests that South Lezgian splits off first. Finally, the Bayesian MCMC method (<xref rid="pone.0116950.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) suggests that East Lezgian splits off first. The distance between two nodes (i.e., consecutive bifurcations between West, South and East proto-languages) is, however, minimal in all the trees, as follows from the tree visualization and the probabilistic values of the branches, and under the assumption of the temporal error of 300 years in StarlingNJ (<xref rid="pone.0116950.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) the split of the Nuclear Lezgian sub-group appears to be a three-way one: West, South and East.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Aghul dialects. All the methods reconstruct the initial separation of the Koshan dialect and the distinct Proper Aghul/Fite clade (that meets intuitive expectations), but then begin to contradict each other. The distance-based methods, i.e., StarlingNJ, NJ, BioNJ, UPGMA (Figs. <xref rid="pone.0116950.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116950.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116950.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) suggest the consecutive separation of the Keren dialect and then of the Gequn one, whereas the character-based Bayesian MCMC method (<xref rid="pone.0116950.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) reconstructs the reverse order: initially Gequn, then Keren. The distance between two nodes (i.e., consecutive bifurcations between Keren, Gequn and Proper Aghul/Fite) is, however, minimal in all the trees, as follows from the tree visualization, and under the assumption of the temporal error of 300 years in StarlingNJ (<xref rid="pone.0116950.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) the split of the proto-Aghul language after the separation of Koshan appears to be a three-way one: Keren, Gequn and Proper Aghul/Fite. As for the UMP-tree, this one differs from the others, see below.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Apparently the most serious discrepancy between the obtained trees (except for the UMP one) concerns the topology of three Rutul dialects. The StarlingNJ and UPGMA methods (Figs. <xref rid="pone.0116950.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116950.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) suggest that the Luchek dialect splits off first. On the contrary, NJ and Bayesian MCMC (Figs. <xref rid="pone.0116950.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116950.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) as well as UMP (<xref rid="pone.0116950.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) reconstruct the initial separation of Ixrek. At the same time, in <xref rid="pone.0116950.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> (StarlingNJ), two Rutul nodes are chronologically remote enough not to get joined under the assumption of the temporal error of 300 years (<xref rid="pone.0116950.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). As follows from the tables of distances, for both the multistate and binary matrices, the lexicostatistical distances in the Rutul part of the tree are not ultrametric, but far from it (Tables <xref rid="pone.0116950.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116950.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Such a situation is not normal for contemporary taxa under the assumption of the constant or nearly constant rate of cognate replacement within the Swadesh wordlist, and individual phylogenetic methods suggest different solutions. From the linguistic point of view, the Rutul data can be explained by two perturbing factors: (1) interdialectal loans and contact-driven homoplasy (there is no way to reveal such cases at the current stage of research); (2) imperfection of the available lexicographic sources which do not permit to compile Swadesh wordlists more accurately. It is difficult to say which one of the two topologies more adequately conforms to the historical reality (cf. [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]), but in any case quantitative methods of genealogical classification can hardly be fully applicable to a situation of mutually intelligible contacting lects (the dialect continuum), as we see in the Rutul territory.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Finally, the UMP method appears to be somewhat isolated among other methods. This one suggests a tree which is partially incompatible with other obtained trees as well as with our informal intuitive ideas about the Lezgian phylogeny (see <xref rid="pone.0116950.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, where the problem nodes are shadowed). Firstly, the main shortcoming is that the Archi language appears to be the first outlier, whereas Udi which is formally the second outlier actually tends to be joined with the next Nuclear Lezgian node. Secondly, the topology of the Aghul dialects remains unresolved, Proper Aghul/Fite are not posited as a robust distinct clade. Since the UMP method contradicts both other phylogenetic methods and traditional expert Lezgian classification (see Sec. 4), I suppose that UMP results should be used with caution.</p></list-item></list><table-wrap id="pone.0116950.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0116950.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Reverse lexicostatistical distances for 3 Rutul dialects (higher percentage of the shared basic vocabulary meaning greater closeness): multistate input matrix.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0116950.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0116950.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ixrek</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Luchek</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mukhad</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.96</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.94</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ixrek</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.91</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><table-wrap id="pone.0116950.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0116950.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Reverse lexicostatistical distances for 3 Rutul dialects (higher percentage of the shared basic vocabulary meaning greater closeness): binary input matrix.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0116950.t002g" xlink:href="pone.0116950.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ixrek</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Luchek</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mukhad</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.973</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.969</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ixrek</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02014;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.955</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>Taking into account the aforementioned discrepancies, the following consensus phylogenetic tree of the Lezgian lects can be manually constructed, see <xref rid="pone.0116950.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>.

All the tested methods suggest the same binary branching, although the Tsakhur dialects are indeed joined in one ternary node in the consensus tree (<xref rid="pone.0116950.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) due to short temporal distance between the original binary nodes. As for three involved Rutul dialects (Mukhad, Ixrek, Luchek), there is no strict classification of these: Mukhad and Ixrek are indeed detached from each other, but Luchek is a &#x0201c;mixed&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;transitional&#x0201d; dialect as described in [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In accordance with it, phylogenetic methods propose different branching patterns for the Rutul clade (see above). Out of five involved Aghul dialects (Koshan, Keren, Gequn, Aghul proper, Fite), Koshan is traditionally regarded as the most detached one, whereas Aghul proper and Fite are specifically close to each other [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The same is suggested by all the tested methods: Koshan is an outlier, Aghul proper and Fite form a distinct clade. The position of Keren and Gequn within the non-Koshan clade is not determined by Caucasologists and in accordance with it, phylogenetic methods propose different branching patterns for Keren and Gequn. It is important to point out that although Caucasologists generally agree about the outlines of the classification, a fully worked out comparative study with identification of shared innovations is not available (but cf.

As concerns the specific method of consonant classes adopted in the present paper, it should be noted that in language history, the bulk of inferred phonetic shifts is typologically trivial (by definition), i.e., the shifts happen within the limits of phonetically justified consonant classes. But certainly mutations between different consonant classes are also rather common and almost inevitable. The ratio of trivial mutations to non-trivial ones is random for individual cases.</p><p>If an algorithm of marking cognation is based on phonetic similarity, some etymologically related words are marked as non-cognate, whereas some phonetically similar, but etymologically unrelated words are marked as cognate. The material difference between the Lezgian etymology-based multistate matrix and the phonetic similarity-based one can be illustrated with a pair of distantly related lects (Archi + Budukh) and a pair of closely related lects (Koshan Aghul + Northern Tabasaran). Archi + Budukh: 81 common Swadesh slots; out of them, 38 (47%) are etymologically related, only 17 (21%) are phonetically similar. Koshan Aghul + Northern Tabasaran: 95 common Swadesh slots; out of them, 70 slots (74%) are etymologically related, only 49 slots (52%) are phonetically similar.</p><p>As follows from the above, phonetic similarity-based cognation marking adds noise into the input matrix as compared with the etymology-based approach. Since Lezgian languages generally demonstrate a lot of non-trivial phonetic changes, it is interesting how various methods cope with phylogeny reconstruction based on the noisy dataset.

One of the reasons for that can be the unconformity of the used model to our ideas of natural language evolution. The MP method depends on homoplasy (i.e., parallel or back developments) to a greater extent than other methods. Correspondingly, for minimization of the effect of homoplastic disturbances, the authors of [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] propose to use individual costs of characters (Weighted maximum parsimony), assigning higher costs to those characters which do not demonstrate homoplasy in the given linguistic data. In the case of binary characters with equal cost of change between the states, homoplasy is equivalent to the presence of two incompatible characters in the input matrix, that is, two characters which take all four possible pairs of states: &#x0201c;00&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;01&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;10&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;11&#x0201d; (see, e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). The MP method, tested in [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], treats changes between the states &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; as equal. But if we&#x02014;as in the present paper&#x02014;use a binary matrix, where &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; denote a marked state of the character and &#x0201c;0&#x0201d;&#x02014;an unmarked one (e.g., &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; = presence, whereas &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; = absence of the specific proto-root with the specific Swadesh meaning in the given language), so the change 1 &#x0003e; 0 (loss of the root) is not a significant event, it can occur independently in different languages, and such a loss may hardly be regarded homoplastic. Thereby to detect <italic>linguistic</italic> homoplasy, it is needed to reconstruct ancestral character states that is actually a non-trivial theoretical and practical task [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], particularly the reconstruction is impossible without the established phylogenetic tree&#x02014;as a result we get in a vicious circle.</p><p>Laying aside this disputable aspect of Barban&#x000e7;on et al.&#x02019;s paper, it can be seen that the authors give preference to the character-based method (MP, Bayesian MCMC) over the distance-based ones (NJ, UPGMA), and this is the main conclusion of the paper [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] (similar views on hierarchy of reliability of phylogenetic methods are gradually prevailing in modern molecular biology).

An unexpected result of the Lezgian test is the relatively low plausibility of the obtained UMP-tree (<xref rid="pone.0116950.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) that straightly contradicts the theoretical calculations of [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>As for the phonetic similarity-based matrix, the distance methods (StarlingNJ, NJ, UPGMA) appear to be more resistant to such inaccurate and irregular input data than the character-based methods (Bayesian MCMC, UMP). It is a somewhat unexpected result. More tests of this kind are needed to clarify the situation.</p><p>The examined Lezgian data support some propositions which serve as an ideological basis of the <italic>Global Lexicostatistical Database</italic> project.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Lexicon is a reliable tool for language classification. It is sometimes claimed by linguists that grammar is preferable for phylogenetic purposes (see. e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]), but I argue that grammatical&#x02014;phonetic, morphological, syntactical&#x02014;characters should be used for language phylogeny with caution (see Sec. 4 on Schulze&#x02019;s unsuccessful attempts to revise Lezgian phylogeny with the mixed set of lexical and grammatical characters; the most well-known experiment of that kind is probably [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], where several phylogenetic methods are tested on the Indo-European data with the mixed lexico-grammatical matrix). First of all, proposed grammatical features are mostly binary, which means the probability of chance coincidences is high (cf., e.g., definitely unrelated Modern English and Thai which share a lot of stable and valuable grammatical characters such as &#x0201c;order of subject, object and verb&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;intensifiers and reflexive pronouns&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;order of relative clause and noun&#x0201d;, and so on [<xref rid="pone.0116950.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]). Secondly, specific grammatical characters may not be universal (when we design a specific list of grammatical characters for an individual language family, it can make our results biased). Thirdly, they can readily produce common areal isoglosses (especially if we are dealing with lects whose relationship is still understood by the speakers), whereas in most cases, it is difficult to detect the source of such an innovation. Fourthly, grammatical characters form a system that means a change of one character may entail a change of other characters. On the contrary, such shortcomings are characteristic of lexical data to a considerably lesser degree (for example, the majority of loanwords and the direction of borrowing can be revealed proceeding from our knowledge of historical phonetics and morphology of the compared language.).</p></list-item><list-item><p>If the involved languages are etymologically elaborated and historical phonetics of this language group is well studied, i.e., the sound correspondences are established, the reliability of a phylogenetic tree depends in the first place not on a calculation method, but on general quality and &#x0201c;purification efficiency&#x0201d; of the input data. In other words, not on computer work, but on work of a linguist which laboriously surveys individual lects (although some phylogenetic methods such as maximal parsimony can indeed give rise to some doubt). See Sec. 3 for detail.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If the historical phonetics of the involved languages is not described and we are forced to mark cognation by simple and formal algorithms, based on phonetic similarity, then the distance-based methods can be even more reliable than the character-based ones.
