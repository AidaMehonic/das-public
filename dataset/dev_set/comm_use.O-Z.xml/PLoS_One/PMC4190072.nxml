Polylaminin stimulates neuritogenesis beyond the levels achieved by ordinary laminin and has been shown to promote axonal regeneration in animal models of spinal cord injury. Here we used confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize its three-dimensional structure. Renderization of confocal optical slices of immunostained polyLM revealed the aspect of a loose flocculated meshwork, which was homogeneously stained by the antibody. On the other hand, an ordinary matrix obtained upon adsorption of laminin in neutral pH (LM) was constituted of bulky protein aggregates whose interior was not accessible to the same anti-laminin antibody. SEM and AFM analyses revealed that the seed unit of polyLM was a flat polygon formed in solution whereas the seed structure of LM was highly heterogeneous, intercalating rod-like, spherical and thin spread lamellar deposits. As polyLM was visualized at progressively increasing magnifications, we observed that the morphology of the polymer was alike independently of the magnification used for the observation. A search for the Hausdorff dimension in images of the two matrices showed that polyLM, but not LM, presented fractal dimensions of 1.55, 1.62 and 1.70 after 1, 8 and 12 hours of adsorption, respectively. Data in the present work suggest that the intrinsic fractal nature of polymerized laminin can be the structural basis for the fractal-like organization of basement membranes in the neurogenic niches of the central nervous system.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq; 476772/2008-7) to TCS.

Laminin regulates a variety of biological phenomena, including the provision of boundaries between neighboring tissues, the establishment of molecular filters and the modulation of cell behavior <xref rid="pone.0109388-Durbeej1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0109388-Yurchenco1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The quaternary structure of laminin is given by three different polypeptide chains, which associate to form a cross-shaped heterotrimer, exhibiting one long and three shorter arms. In the three-dimensional space laminin has the shape of a three-leafed clover, in which the leaves correspond to the three short arms while the stem corresponds to the long arm. This 3-D structure is particularly adequate to favor the assembly of a sheet-like polymer, where the three short arms simultaneously interact with each other within a single spatial plane, while the long arm is left available to interact with the surface of contiguous cells <xref rid="pone.0109388-Hohenester1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>As a consequence of its structural properties, laminin can spontaneously self-polymerize in a test tube, requiring either a minimal protein concentration <xref rid="pone.0109388-Yurchenco2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> or a decrease in the solution pH <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Polymers formed upon pH acidification, designated as polylaminin (polyLM<sup>1</sup>), present specific signaling properties and have been shown to stimulate the outgrowth of neurites with at least twice the efficiency of ordinary laminin (LM), namely a matrix obtained by adsorbing the protein diluted in neutral pH onto a glass coverslip <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. PolyLM was also shown to reverse the loss of migratory and neuritogenic potentials of cortical neurons and to promote the survival and the proliferation of axotomized retinal ganglion cells, both isolated from newborn rodents <xref rid="pone.0109388-HochmanMendez1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Finally, it was demonstrated that polyLM, but not the laminin protein diluted in neutral buffer, promoted axonal regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury in rats <xref rid="pone.0109388-Menezes1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The morphology of polyLM has previously been studied both at the micro and at the nanometer scales. Using negative staining followed by transmission electron microscopy it was possible to characterize it as a regular polygonal network displaying the same features of the natural laminin networks assembled by living cells <xref rid="pone.0109388-Barroso1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109388-Yurchenco3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In such polymers the unit polygon was a hexagon of approximately 30 nm of side, which well corresponded to the size of each short arm in the laminin molecule. Curiously, a polygonal array of comparable features was observed at a three orders of magnitude larger scale when immunolabeled polyLM was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire4" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>The fact that polyLM observed at different magnifications showed similar structures suggested that the polymer could be a fractal structure. Nevertheless, the lack of images obtained at intermediary magnifications, as well as the insufficient resolution of previous epifluorescence photomicrographs, prevented the search for a fractal dimension of polyLM. In the present work we used confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to obtain a detailed structural characterization of polyLM that would permit assessment of its putative fractal nature. We showed that polyLM presented a fractal dimension, which increased its complexity upon accumulation of the polymer on a flat substrate. These findings may have important implications as they can provide an intrinsic molecular basis for the fractal-like organization of the basement membranes present at the neurogenic niches in the adult central nervous system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Preparation of laminin matrices</title><p>PolyLM was produced by diluting EHS laminin (laminin 111; Invitrogen) to 50 &#x000b5;g/mL with 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 4), containing 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.

PolyLM corresponded to a sponge-like network of an apparently homogeneous density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109388-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

In a previous study <xref rid="pone.0109388-Barroso1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, we had already shown that one of these polymers, polyLM, displayed the same nanostructure reported for laminin arrays secreted by cells <xref rid="pone.0109388-Yurchenco3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Moreover, we had described that polyLM and LM presented different morphologies in the range of tens of micrometers <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Nevertheless intermediary magnifications between these two ranges of sizes had never been assessed before. Using confocal, electronic and atomic force microscopy we filled in this gap and found that surprisingly polyLM presented similar structures independently of the magnification used to observe it. Since this property is a feature of fractals, we searched for a possible fractal dimension and confirmed that polyLM indeed corresponded to a fractal structure. Conversely, the second polymer, LM, was more heterogeneous and did not present a fractal nature.</p><p>Before addressing the biological significance of the present findings it is important to recapitulate the features of the polymers studied here. The term ordinary laminin (LM) is used to refer to clusters of laminin adsorbed onto a glass surface at a concentration below the critical concentration of 60&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;g/ml, previously shown to induce solution polymerization at pH 7 <xref rid="pone.0109388-Yurchenco2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In this condition the protein does not self-assemble in solution but it tends to form clusters as its concentration increases at the glass surface upon decantation/adsorption. Since laminin is used as a coating substrate for cell attachment at concentrations below the critical concentration (typically between 1 and 20 &#x000b5;g/ml), ordinary laminin can be considered as the standard form of the protein referred to in the literature. On the other hand, polylaminin (polyLM) is an artificial polymer generated upon pH acidification. It is formed independently of the protein concentration and it is not disrupted after increasing the pH to 7 <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It was initially described as a high molecular weight entity observed in solution by monitoring a spectroscopic parameter, namely static light scattering <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. At a given medium and at a fixed wavelength, the intensity of light scattering is related to the size of the particles in solution, which allows for the use of this technique to follow the aggregation state of proteins in the presence or not of ligands or other interacting particles of biological interest <xref rid="pone.0109388-Hediyeh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore, the 40-fold increase in light-scattering intensity observed upon transferring laminin from acidic to neutral buffer reflected an increase in the volume of protein particles in solution <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These particles were subsequently called &#x0201c;polymers&#x0201d;, instead of &#x0201c;aggregates&#x0201d;, which would suggest that they corresponded to clusters of denaturated protein. The term &#x0201c;polymer&#x0201d; was employed due to evidence that 1) the tertiary structure of laminin was preserved within the clustered particles <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; 2) decanted/adsorbed particles formed biomimetic matrices both at the nano <xref rid="pone.0109388-Barroso1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and at the micrometer scales of size <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and 3) key signaling properties of laminin were preserved and even augmented after the acid-induced assemblage, which was demonstrated mainly for neurons <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but also for other cells types as glial <xref rid="pone.0109388-HochmanMendez1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and thyroid cells <xref rid="pone.0109388-Palmero1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The concept that the polymeric structure of proteins can influence their biological properties has gained increasing confirmation in recent years. In particular, laminin, a protein that occurs in the polymeric form in natural basement membranes, is known to have their signaling properties dependent on the establishment of the polymeric array <xref rid="pone.0109388-Yurchenco1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109388-Hohenester1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The interaction of laminin with other components of basement membranes, such as nidogens and/or the proteoglycan perlecan, is also influenced by polymerization, which is postulated to create new interacting sites at the nanoscale that did not exist in the individual molecule <xref rid="pone.0109388-Behrens1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These studies however considered polymerization as having only two states (non-polymerized and polymerized). In other words, the polymeric state corresponded to a single entity, a supramolecular array in which the laminin trimers interacted with each other to form a sheet-like polymer anchored to the plasma membrane through cellular receptors. Such sheet-like polymer corresponds to the internal layer of basement membranes. However, there is evidence that certain tissues can produce other types of laminin structures. For instance, skeletal muscle fibers <italic>in vitro</italic> display membrane-bound deposits of laminin of two distinct morphologies <xref rid="pone.0109388-Colognato1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, a reticular and a fibrillar one. These two morphologies were assigned to result from interactions with different cellular receptors, which, by presenting distinct regional distributions on the membrane, would lead to the formation of each laminin deposit. One complementary explanation, however, is that the morphologies of the two deposits at the micrometer scale would reflect specific molecular interactions at the nanometer range and therefore could involve interaction with the same receptor. In the nervous system, deposits of laminin appear with four different shapes throughout the development of the brain <xref rid="pone.0109388-Liesi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109388-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In consonance with these <italic>in vivo</italic> findings, neurons isolated from lateral and medial regions of the midbrain have been shown to secrete either punctate or fibrillar laminin matrices, respectively <xref rid="pone.0109388-GarciaAbreu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Neurons from embryonic and neonatal brain cortex have also been shown to produce distinct laminin matrices, whereas one remained associated to the cell membrane, the other extended away from the cell surface, exhibiting the appearance of an array of tangled threads <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire4" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Finally, laminin deposits found in the neural stem cell niche, present two different morphologies described as puncta alternated with thin linear membranous structures anchored to blood vessels <xref rid="pone.0109388-Kazanis1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109388-Mercier1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. We propose that the two laminin matrices observed in the present work reflect two alternative manners of protein assembly.</p><p>One important question to address is how this fractal would be generated and what would determine the self-assembly of laminin units into polyLM, LM or any other polymer. In a biological setting, the interaction with integrins and other laminin receptors would guide the process. As most of them bind to the long arm of laminin, it can be predicted that the simultaneous interaction of laminin trimers with membrane receptors will influence the formation of the type of polymerization. The ideal distance between two neighboring receptors to selectively favor interactions only among the short arms of laminin should correspond to the distance between the centers of the laminin molecules in the hexagonal network, <italic>i.e.</italic>, approximately 52 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109388-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). If the distance is such or shorter a flat polymer should be favored. On the other hand, as the spacing between receptors increased, other arrangements would be allowed. Interestingly, it has been shown that in fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells the ideal distance for signaling through integrins was in the range of 50&#x02013;70 nm <xref rid="pone.0109388-CavalcantiAdam1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109388-Frith1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>In the case of a polymer generated in a cell-free system as polyLM the lack of cellular receptors demands an alternative explanation. By analyzing the distribution of surface charges, we have previously shown that the pH acidification necessary to trigger the formation of polyLM rends the distal portion of the long arm (fragments LG4 and LG5) completely positive <xref rid="pone.0109388-Barroso1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We proposed that this would be the determinant for the prevention of the interaction between two long arms, which is the predominant laminin-laminin interaction in the absence of other molecules <xref rid="pone.0109388-Yurchenco2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Therefore, polyLM could give rise to a hexagonal polymer mimicking the sheet-like polymer assembled on the cell surface even before adsorption to the coverslip. The previous report that polyLM increased the light scattering of the solution containing it, while LM in similar conditions did not, supports this notion <xref rid="pone.0109388-Freire1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The seed polymer already decants as a fractal structure within one hour of incubation and the complexity of the fractal increases as deposition proceeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109388-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>). The height of the lowest structures found in polyLM and LM were around 60 nm and 120 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109388-g005">Fig. 5D, L</xref>). Interestingly, the former is the approximate size of the extended long arm of laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109388-g006">Fig. 6G</xref>). Such an extended conformation of individual laminin molecules has been previously detected by using electron microscopy after rotatory shadowing <xref rid="pone.0109388-Yurchenco2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and AFM <xref rid="pone.0109388-RodrguezHernndez1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Thus, it is likely that polyLM sediments as flat 2-D polymers in which only interactions among the short arms occur, as also suggested by the AFM measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109388-g006">Fig. 6D&#x02013;F</xref>). On the other hand, in LM at least two layers of flat polymers mediated by interactions between long arms would be necessary to account for the 120 nm height observed in the lowest deposits.</p><p>In the present work we demonstrate that the protein laminin can give rise to a fractal structure. The observation that the supramolecular organization of a pure protein (polyLM) is fractal implies that the information contained ultimately within its primary sequence is sufficient to determine the morphology of larger structures that will spatially organize tissue compartments. This is particularly interesting because it correlates with the &#x0201c;fractal-like&#x0201d; organization of the niche for stem cells in the subventricular zone of the adult brain. In this case, a laminin-rich basement membrane, named &#x0201c;fractone&#x0201d;, has been proposed to orient the binding of proteoglycans, which, in turn, organize the distribution of the growth factors controlling the maintenance of the stem cell niche <xref rid="pone.0109388-Mercier1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109388-Chyba1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, as shown to be the case for bFGF <xref rid="pone.0109388-Douet1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Although fractones have been described only in the central nervous system, it is well possible that a similar fractal-like extracellular matrix is present in other stem cell niches. Adult stem cell niches manifest under certain restricted microenvironments that host tissue-specific stem cells and regulate their physiology. They exhibit complex cytoarchitectures composed of stem cells, progenitor cells, supportive cells and a laminin-rich basement membrane. The basement membrane regulates cell division and differentiation within the niche due to several of its properties <xref rid="pone.0109388-Nikolova1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. First, its molecular components interact with integrins to regulate the cytoskeletal assembly. It also harbors and controls the availability of growth factors and cytokines. A basement membrane provides an orienting surface for asymmetric cell division. Finally, it guides the traffic of progenitor cells within the niche. It is known that the assembly of basement membranes is initiated and dictated by laminin secretion and polymerization at the cell surface <xref rid="pone.0109388-Yurchenco4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In addition, laminin is able to interact with integrins, to bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which, in turn, present soluble factors. It is thus very likely that laminin is the key component in basement membranes to play a regulatory role controlling the physiology of the stem cell niche. The importance of laminin for the maintenance of the stem cell niches has been demonstrated in several cases such as in pancreatic islets <xref rid="pone.0109388-Nikolova2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109388-Qu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, the germline niche <xref rid="pone.0109388-KanatsuShinohara1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0109388-Lander1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and the embryonic neocortical stem cell niche <xref rid="pone.0109388-Loulier1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that the fractal-like organization of stem cell niches can not only control the distribution of growth factors but also provide a physical constrain for progenitor cells during differentiation. The representation of a differentiation pathway as a tree, in which the stem corresponds to the stem cell and the branches, to progenitors is <italic>per se</italic> a fractal. In this scenario, the propagation of laminin polymerization throughout lager size scales could be a key step for the organization of multicellular organisms, which is in line with the observations that laminin-containing basement membranes are the first assembled extracellular matrix appearing during mammalian development and that laminin is present in virtually all metazoans <xref rid="pone.0109388-Miner2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109388.s001"><label>Movie S1</label><caption><p><bold>Animated view of the three-dimensional structure of polyLM.</bold> The animation was generated from a series of confocal optical slices (the same shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109388-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), using the software Imaris, version 7.2.3.
