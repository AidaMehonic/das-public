Antibody testing using commercially available cell-based assays (CBA) or immunohistochemistry on rat brain tissue has proven high specificity and sensitivity. Here we compare an immunofluorescence live CBA to a flow cytometry (FACS) based assay to detect NMDAR antibodies by their binding to the surface of HEK293A cells functionally expressing NMDAR. Both assays were first established using a discovery group of 76 individuals and then validated in a group of 32 patients in a blinded manner. In the CBA, 23 of 23 patients with NMDAR encephalitis were positive for NMDAR antibodies and 0 of 85 controls (32 healthy controls and 53 patients with other neurological diseases), resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 85.1&#x02013;100.0 and 95.7&#x02013;100.0, respectively). The FACS based assay detected NMDAR antibodies in 20 of 23 patients and in 0 of 85 controls. Therefore, with an equally high specificity (95% CI 95.7&#x02013;100.0) the sensitivity of the FACS based assay was 87% (95% CI 66.4&#x02013;97.2). Comparing antibody titers from CBA with delta median fluorescence intensities from FACS showed a high concordance (kappa = 0.943, p&#x0003c;0.0001) and correlation (r = 0.697, p&#x0003c;0.0001). In conclusion, evaluation of the FACS based assay revealed a lower sensitivity and high inter-assay variation, making the CBA a more reliable detection method.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Fonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Austria (FWF graduate program W1206 SPIN, MeR and MaR; FWF project J3230, RH).

The association of prominent psychiatric symptoms in the context of severe encephalitis and an underlying ovarian teratoma initially facilitated the discovery of this disorder [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A majority of patients are female and the disease often occurs in childhood or early adolescence [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In adults, symptoms are initially psychiatric with insomnia and agitation, followed by dyskinesias, seizures, memory deficits, speech problems and a decrease in the level of consciousness often leading to autonomic instabilities [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In children, the first symptoms are often seizures or dyskinesias, subsequently progressing to develop the other components of the syndrome. Immunotherapy is effective in most patients, limiting the frequency of relapses and lethality [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. After the first description of NMDAR antibodies, patients initially presenting with encephalitic and epileptic symptoms of unknown origin became more frequently diagnosed with NMDAR encephalitis [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The gold standard for the detection of disease specific NMDAR antibodies, which is crucial for the diagnosis of NMDAR encephalitis, comprises testing the immunoreactive binding of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples to fixed and permeabilized NMDAR transfected cells (fixed cell-based assay [CBA]) and immunohistochemistry of frozen sections of rat brain optimized for the detection of antibodies against cell surface or synaptic proteins [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Alternatively, CBA using live cells with subsequent fixation can be used to detect autoantibodies against NMDAR [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], although the live CBA was suggested to have a lower sensitivity compared to the fixed CBA [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>NMDAR are heterotetramers composed of three different NMDAR subunits (NR1-3). Whereas NR1 is ubiquitously present and required for expression of functional NMDAR on the cell surface, distinct NR2(A-D) and NR3(A, B) subunits assemble with NR1 [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hippocampal NMDAR are predominantly composed of NR1 in combination with NR2A and/or NR2B, with an age-dependent shift from NR2B to NR2A [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is now well established that antibodies from NMDAR encephalitis patients are of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass and react with an N-terminal epitope on the NR1 subunit. The binding to NR1 depends on the conformation of the antigen using either live or fixed NMDAR expressing cells, with or without the presence of NR2 subunits [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we compare another live CBA using HEK293A cells expressing NR1/NR2A/NR2B containing functional NMDAR followed by microscopic analysis to a flow cytometry (FACS) based analysis of the test, since the evaluation of cell surface staining by fluorescence microscopy is strongly dependent on the experience of the investigators. Furthermore, a FACS based analysis to detect antibodies to surface antigens would enable quantification of antibody levels over time and also to precisely calculate intrathecal synthesis of the antibodies in those diseases. To assess diagnostic accuracy we evaluate the performance of the two detection methods used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Patients</title><p>Serum samples from patients and controls were collected in the Clinical Department of Neurology Innsbruck and the Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nic Barcelona between 2005 and 2013, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use.

Therefore, this form of encephalitis is likely to be underdiagnosed, and there is an increasing need for the availability of antibody testing.</p><p>In the present study we compared a live CBA with FACS based analysis to detect serum autoantibodies binding to NMDAR. Sensitivities were high in both testing methods, although we found a higher sensitivity in the CBA (100%) compared to the FACS based analysis (87%). Using a lower serum dilution did not increase the sensitivity of the FACS assay and revealed that the cut-off &#x00394;MFI was variable in a different batch of experiments, further demonstrating a high inter-assay variation. Whereas some samples yielded reproducibly low (and others high) results, even when comparing results from different batches of experiments, others showed a very high inter-assay variability, suggesting that trypsinization might destroy the epitope recognized by some sera but not others. In general, although the inter-assay variation was already high when using the same batch of cells for analysis, it further increased (25 to 36%) when including the same samples analyzed with another batch of cells used for transfection. It is therefore recommended to set a new &#x00394;MFI in every experiment for future attempts to improve a FACS based analysis for detection of surface antigens, which can be a logistical challenge. In our analysis this became even more evident, when two sera that were false negative in the original analysis would have been positive in the second. Consequently, by regularly setting new cut-offs, the sensitivity could possibly be improved, but as one sample was still missed, the CBA would still have yielded a better sensitivity.</p><p>False negative samples showed already low NMDAR specific signals rather than high background fluorescence. Although overall we observed a high correlation between CBA titers and &#x00394;MFI, false negative samples did not necessarily have a low titer in the CBA. Therefore it is not likely that the fluorescence signal is too weak to be detected by the flow cytometer. Rather, cells expressing fluorescently labeled NMDAR but partly retaining the receptors intracellularly might accumulate and decrease the relative number of cells expressing NMDAR on their surface, leading to a low signal of surface bound IgG, resulting in the observed lower sensitivity compared to the CBA. As can be seen in visual inspections, the frequency of cells expressing NMDAR on the surface varies, which could also be a source of high inter-assay variation in the FACS based assay. The use of fixed and permeabilized cells would make intracellular epitopes accessible, but then it is not possible to exclude dead cells any more, which could lead to unspecific binding, possibly resulting in a lower specificity.</p><p>Both methods are based on the expression of functional NMDAR in HEK293A cells, differing only in the detection of secondary antibody signals. A FACS based analysis would have several advantages. Signal strength correlates with antibody titers and is therefore a quantitative method without the need for analyzing serial dilutions. In contrast to CBA, FACS based analysis does not rely on the experience of the investigators. Furthermore, once a sample has been analyzed, original data can always be reevaluated. However, since the sensitivity of the FACS based analysis was lower (87%), and the inter-assay variation was high, this method is currently not reliable for routine antibody testing. Moreover, FACS based analysis has limitations for the study of CSF samples, which in some patients is crucial for antibody detection. Future studies to improve sensitivity and reproducibility of the FACS based analysis should aim to use non-adherent cells to avoid differential destruction of epitopes by trypsinization. A further challenge will be to adjust cut-offs in every new experiment, e.g. by using internal reference samples or by readjusting the cut-off in every experiment using control sera.</p><p>Hippocampal NMDAR form tetramers with two NR1 and two NR2 subunits, with an age-dependent shift from NR2B to NR2A [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast to existing testing methods using either transfected cells with only NR1 [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or in combination with NR2B [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] we used NMDAR containing both NR2A and NR2B, aiming to increase the density of functional NMDAR expressed on the surface of HEK293A cells and not to miss any NMDAR antibodies due to age-dependent changes in subunit composition. NMDAR encephalitis is associated with antibodies recognizing a well-defined epitope on the extracellular region of the NR1 subunit of NMDAR [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In contrast, antibodies to the NR2A or NR2B subunits react with a linear epitope and their significance is unclear. In our testing methods, we used live cells expressing functional NMDAR without disruption of the native conformation. Since NR2A and NR2B cannot be expressed on the cell surface without the presence of NR1 [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we did not find any antibodies recognizing either NR2A or NR2B alone with this setting, neither in NMDAR encephalitis patients nor in controls. Moreover, with our assay we were able to avoid unspecific antibody binding to dead cells. This is not possible in assays where cells are fixed before [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or after [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122037.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] serum (or CSF) incubation as it is done in other labs. In contrast to others that used NMDAR and EGFP co-transfected cells [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] we used NMDAR subunits directly fused to EmGFP (NR1) or GFP (NR2B) for transfection of cells, which enabled us to truly colocalize NMDAR with bound antibodies. Through the combination of using live cells and NMDAR directly linked to a fluorophore we could even visualize the internalization of NMDAR which is known to occur in response to NMDAR antibodies by applying patients&#x02019; antibodies to cultured neurons [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or by intraventricular infusion of patients&#x02019; antibodies into mice [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. And finally, to our knowledge this is the first live CBA that includes protection of the cells by (+)-MK-801 against excitotoxicity throughout the staining procedure, which we found is crucial for not losing living cells that bind NMDAR antibodies to their surface, particularly in the FACS based assay. This might also explain the discrepancy in sensitivity of our test compared to a lower sensitivity in live CBA found by others [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we focused on the establishment of serologic antibody testing methods since the availability of CSF was limited, the collection of CSF is invasive, and serum testing often produces more background than CSF testing. A study investigating the largest known cohort of NMDAR encephalitis patients [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] found a better correlation of CSF antibody titer with disease activity, and CSF was suggested to be more sensitive than serum [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Future investigations should aim to optimize the FACS based analysis to provide more reliable results, even when only low CSF volumes are available.</p><p>Controversial data exist regarding NMDAR antibody levels in serum and their clinical relevance [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], further underlined by a recent study using a live CBA with fixation after serum incubation that showed serum positivity in 23% of patients with an unlikely autoimmune syndrome, as well as CSF negativity in some cases considered with definite NMDAR encephalitis [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In contrast to their live CBA, here we used endpoint titration instead of a visual scoring system. Furthermore, we found that protection of the NMDAR overexpressing cells is necessary throughout the assay to assure their survival, which is of particular importance when assessing undiluted CSF. One limitation of our assay is that we used only sera of NMDAR encephalitis patients that had a definite clinical diagnosis partly based on their seropositivity to assess specificity and sensitivity. This limitation is in part caused by the fact that using previously established criteria that confer high specificity and sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0122037.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], some of the authors (RH and JD) never encountered patients with NMDAR encephalitis without antibodies in the CSF, or patients with serum NMDAR antibodies and an unlikely autoimmune disorder. It is therefore even more important to launch a multicenter study to compare results of different laboratories that conduct NMDAR antibody testing.</p><p>In conclusion, we compared two highly sensitive serologic testing methods to detect autoantibodies to NMDAR. In our experience both methods had a high specificity, whereas the sensitivity of the immunofluorescence CBA was higher than that of the FACS assay. This might be especially important for the analysis of CSF antibodies, since they are crucial for the diagnosis of NMDAR encephalitis, and a particularly high sensitivity is needed due to the low amounts of immunoglobulins that can be present in CSF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0122037.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Staining of NMDAR overexpressing HEK293A cells with antibodies against NMDAR subunits.</title><p>Cells stained with antibodies against NR1 (A), NR2A (B), and NR2B (C) are shown, respectively.(Em)GFP = (emerald) green fluorescent protein.
