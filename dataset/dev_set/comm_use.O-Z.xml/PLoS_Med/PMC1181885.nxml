</related-article></article-meta></front><body><p>One solution for fair-minded doctors not mentioned by Smith [<xref rid="pmed-0020221-b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] might be to keep away from major high-impact journals and subscribe instead to those with a lower profile but that serve their specialty. I analysed all original papers published in the last 12 issues of <italic>Archives of Disease in Childhood</italic>. Of 198 such papers, there were seven (3.5&#x00025;) manufacturer-funded studies dealing with drugs, vaccines, or infant foods. Another ten papers (5&#x00025;) dealt with drugs or vaccines, including three reports of adverse events, but were not funded by industry. The funding of one was obscure. This pristine record was somewhat spoiled by a sponsored supplement, but clearly labelled as such, about a particular medication. It provoked an angry correspondence on the subscribers' message board of one of the co-publishers. It seems that at least paediatrics, a far-away specialty of which Smith may know little, treads a careful path.</p></body><back><fn-group><fn id="n3" fn-type="other"><p>
