Despite its high potential for urban emergence, MAYV is still an obscure virus with scarce information about its infection cycle, including the corresponding early events. Even for prototypical alphaviruses, the cell entry mechanism still has some rough edges to trim: although clathrin-mediated endocytosis is quoted as the putative route, alternative paths as distinct as direct virus genome injection through the cell plasma membrane seems to be possible. Our aim was to clarify crucial details on the entry route exploited by MAYV to gain access into the host cell. Tracking the virus since its first contact with the surface of Vero cells by fluorescence microscopy, we show that its entry occurs by a fast endocytic process and relies on fusion with acidic endosomal compartments. Moreover, blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis or depleting cholesterol from the cell membrane leads to a strong inhibition of viral infection, as assessed by plaque assays. Following this clue, we found that early endosomes and caveolae-derived vesicles are both implicated as target membranes for MAYV fusion. Our findings unravel the very first events that culminate in a productive infection by MAYV and shed light on potential targets for a rational antiviral therapy, besides providing a better comprehension of the entry routes exploited by alphaviruses to get into the cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Mayaro virus</kwd><kwd>Arboviruses</kwd><kwd>Virus entry</kwd><kwd>Endocytosis</kwd><kwd>Clathrin-coated vesicles</kwd><kwd>Caveolae-derived vesicles</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior (CAPES)</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (CNPq)</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-3"><funding-source>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-4"><funding-source>Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP)</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-5"><funding-source>Instituto Nacional de Ci&#x000ea;ncia e Tecnologia de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem (INBEB)</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-6"><funding-source>Programa de Apoio a N&#x000fa;cleos de Excel&#x000ea;ncia (PRONEX)</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior (CAPES), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (CNPq), Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ), Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP), Instituto Nacional de Ci&#x000ea;ncia e Tecnologia de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem (INBEB) and Programa de Apoio a N&#x000fa;cleos de Excel&#x000ea;ncia (PRONEX).

For those viruses that have a surrounding lipid bilayer&#x02014;the so-called enveloped viruses, the entry process usually involves fusion of the viral envelope with either the plasma membrane or the endosomal membrane of the host cell (<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000e1;s &#x00026; Melero, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Among the enveloped viruses, the mechanism adopted by the members of the genus <italic>Alphavirus</italic> (family <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) during cell entry is well studied, however there are still gaps to be filled. This virus genus includes arboviruses related to either encephalitogenic or arthritogenic diseases in humans and is represented by the prototypes Sindbis (SINV) and Semliki Forest (SFV) viruses (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Gould et al., 2010</xref>). While SFV entry classically occurs by receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by fusion with the endosomal membrane (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Helenius et al., 1980</xref>; <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Marsh, Bolzau &#x00026; Helenius, 1983</xref>), more recent works suggest that SINV delivers its genome in the host cell through a pore-like structure formed at the plasma membrane level without the occurrence of membrane fusion&#x02014;which is unusual for enveloped viruses (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Paredes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Despite intense studies on these prototypical alphaviruses, knowledge on several members of the genus is still obscure, even though these viruses represent important public health concern (<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">LaBeaud, 2008</xref>). One such example is Mayaro virus (MAYV), an alphavirus endemic in the Amazon region and closely related to Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which has recently spread in an epidemic way over many areas of the world. Just as with CHIKV, MAYV infection in humans leads to a febrile illness followed by a highly debilitating arthralgia (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">De Figueiredo &#x00026; Figueiredo, 2014</xref>).</p><p>MAYV is transmitted by the same vector which transmits the sylvatic Yellow Fever virus, namely <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Pinheiro &#x00026; LeDuc, 1998</xref>), and it was already shown that, at least in laboratory, MAYV can replicate in and be transmitted by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, an anthropophilic mosquito highly adapted to urban areas (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2011</xref>). Due to partial overlap of symptoms, Mayaro fever may be misdiagnosed as Dengue fever and other exanthematous febrile diseases, thus underestimating the actual number of human cases of MAYV infection (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Zuchi et al., 2014</xref>). The increasing number of outbreaks of Mayaro fever in South America (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Lwande et al., 2015</xref>) coupled with its constant import to non-endemic areas as far as Europe (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Receveur et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Hassing et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Neumayr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Theilacker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Slegers et al., 2014</xref>), reinforce the imminent threat of MAYV urban emergence. Despite the relevance of MAYV as a human pathogen and the potential for its emergence in urban areas, Mayaro fever is yet a greatly neglected disease (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Forshey et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we investigated the early events of MAYV infection by tracking the virus entry into the host cell and the interactions of virus particles with different cell compartments.

We did not observe any significant difference on infectivity between labeled and unlabeled virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref>). The labeling was performed under a high density of DiD molecules per virion so that virus particles were initially almost non-fluorescent due to the characteristic self-quenching of this fluorophore. Upon virus fusion with a cellular target membrane, one could expect the fluorescence intensity to increase specifically at the site of the event as DiD molecules from the donor membrane diluted into the acceptor membrane&#x02014;thus relieving the fluorescence quenching. On the other hand, no increase in fluorescence intensity should be expected if a non-fusogenic route was the rule.

Tracking the fluorescence dequenching of DiD-labeled virions at the single particle level, we observed that MAYV fuses with the endosomal membrane in approximately 3 min after binding to the cell surface. From binding to fusion, this virus takes approximately 3 min to complete this process, while other species such as Influenza virus and Dengue virus (DENV), take approximately 10 min to carry out the same tasks (<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Rust et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Van der Schaar et al., 2007</xref>). Our data reveal that MAYV fusogenic reaction occurs within early compartments in the endocytic pathway, which may explain the shorter time taken by MAYV to reach the cytosol when compared to virus species known to fuse with late endosomes (<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimura et al., 1982</xref>; <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Van der Schaar et al., 2008</xref>). Such fast endosomal escape may represent a selected advantage by avoiding virus particle exposure to highly-active acid hydrolases and allowing an early onset of viral genome replication.</p><p>Many single-virus tracking studies have employed lipophilic fluorescent probes to label enveloped viruses in order to analyze the role of membrane fusion during their entry into target cells (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Brandenburg &#x00026; Zhuang, 2007</xref>). The choice of fluorophores to be used in such analyses is often driven by their efficiency to be incorporated in the viral envelope without compromising the virus particle infectivity. However, it is important to highlight that fluorophore-labeled viruses are usually inactivated upon exposure to microscope excitation light (<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Wainwright, 2004</xref>). The fact that DiD-labeled viruses do not suffer photoinactivation explains our choice for DiD rather than other lipophilic fluorophores&#x02014;e.g., octadecyl rhodamine B (R18)&#x02014;to label MAYV envelope (<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Thongthai &#x00026; Weninger, 2009</xref>). Given this fact and the characteristic low particle-to-PFU ratio of alphavirus preparations (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez, Brown &#x00026; Paredes, 2014</xref>), our virus tracking setup increases the chances of tracking a virion capable of generating a productive infection. Besides, we observed a strong positive correlation between efficiently-fused and genome-containing particles, which reveals that the internalized viruses are not empty particles that were nonspecifically endocytosed after having delivered their genomes through the plasma membrane, further supporting the infectious potential of our virus preparation.</p><p>Interestingly, our particle tracking experiments revealed a decrease in the number of fluorescent spots concomitantly to an increase in their size as a function of the time elapsed after virus internalization, suggesting that the vesicles exploited by MAYV for cell entry converge to a common structure located close to the perinuclear region. Such structure may be the previously described type I cytopathic vacuoles (CPVs-I), on which surface viral genome replication occurs (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Froshauer, Kartenbeck &#x00026; Helenius, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Kujala et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of specific requirements during virus entry points clathrin-mediated endocytosis as an important pathway for MAYV entry into the cell. Considering that clathrin-coated vesicles are directed to early endosomes, whose contents are acidified by ATP-powered proton pumps (<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Goldstein et al., 1985</xref>), the findings that MAYV entry is inhibited by acidotropic weak bases and occurs through virus fusion with Rab5<sup>+</sup> vesicles further support a role for such pathway in virus entry. Regarding the mobilization of early endosomes, the mechanism of MAYV entry is similar to that described for the alphaviruses SFV and CHIKV. Nevertheless, while SFV is internalized in the target cell via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, CHIKV entry is mediated by a process that does not depend on this protein (<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Vonderheit &#x00026; Helenius, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Bernard et al., 2010</xref>). Our finding showing that only a fraction of the incoming MAYV particles fuses with Rab5<sup>+</sup> vesicles is in accordance with a previous study on SINV entry into BHK-21cells, which showed that about 40% of the incoming virus particles did not co-localize with Rab5<sup>+</sup> vesicles (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Gu, Yang &#x00026; Liu, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, we show that MAYV alternatively uses cholesterol-enriched caveolae-derived vesicles to get into the cytoplasm, which helps to explain its critical dependence on cholesterol for infection&#x02014;as a matter of fact, a specific interaction of SINV and SFV glycoproteins with target-membrane cholesterol has been observed before (<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Kielian, Chanel-Vos &#x00026; Liao, 2010</xref>). It should be noted that MAYV seems to mobilize cholesterol-enriched domains also to exit the host cell, since its envelope bears high-cholesterol content (<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Sousa Jr et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that such membrane microdomains are widely exploited during the infection cycle of MAYV. Interestingly, some Cav1<sup>+</sup> vesicles to which MAYV particles fused were shown to co-localize with Rab5<sup>+</sup> vesicles, suggesting that virions taking such alternative route are subsequently delivered into early endosomes. Indeed, cargo uptake via caveolae-derived vesicles does not exclude a later association with early endosomes (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Pelkmans et al., 2004</xref>). Given the strong MAYV dependence on low pH for its entry, this passage through an early endosome may be a critical step for an efficient virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-8">Fig. 8</xref>). It is worth highlighting that the caveolae-derived vesicles tracked in our experiment do not represent the formerly proposed &#x0201c;caveosomes&#x0201d;, large neutral pH-endocytic compartments enriched in caveolin whose existence was questioned half a decade ago (<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Parton &#x00026; Howes, 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig-8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.3245/fig-8</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Model for MAYV entry into the host cell.</title><p>After binding to receptors on the cell surface, MAYV particles take endocytic routes to reach the cytosol.

Such nonspecific effect could compromise membrane trafficking events from cell periphery to the cell interior, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, thus further contributing to the remarkable deleterious effect of methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin treatment on MAYV infection and confirming the strong dependence on endocytosis for its internalization. Moreover, although our results clearly support MAYV entry through the endocytic route, exploring different pathways, we cannot rule out the hypothesis that the unusual mechanism of entry through the plasma membrane without the occurrence of membrane fusion, as previously suggested for SINV (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Paredes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), may be also used by MAYV. However, given that disturbances of the endocytic pathway strongly inhibit virus infection, we conclude that any non-endocytic route would be of minor significance for MAYV infection.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the urbanization of Mayaro fever from the Amazon region is imminent and that the virus has a real potential to adapt to new vectors (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2011</xref>) and spread to non-endemic areas (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Receveur et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Hassing et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Neumayr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Theilacker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Slegers et al., 2014</xref>).
