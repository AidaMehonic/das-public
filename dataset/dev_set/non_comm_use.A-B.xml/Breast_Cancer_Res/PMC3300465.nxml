These people will have, in the main, little or no experience of breast units or even radiography, and will need quite close and detailed supervision.</p><p>Radiographers will still, in most units, remain as the lynchpin workers in the screening and symptomatic clinics, at least for the next few years while the level one workers are being trained. These radiographers will be essential for maintaining the service at its present level and for the future extension and expansion of the programme.</p><p>Suitably enthusiastic radiographers will be required to train into the advanced level practices as identified by their particular units. In time and with proper training it may be that the future lead practitioners within this 4-tier structure will be radiographers.</p></sec></body></article>
