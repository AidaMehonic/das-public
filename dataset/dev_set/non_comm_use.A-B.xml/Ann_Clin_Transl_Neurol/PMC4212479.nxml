Ceramide is at the central hub of sphingolipid metabolism and is synthesized de novo from serine and palmitoyl-CoA. In the third step of this four-step process, ceramide synthases acylate dihydro-sphingosine (dHSphingosine) to form dihydro-ceramide (dHCeramide). Six mammalian ceramide synthases (CERS1-6) (shown in red) have been identified and each of these utilizes a unique subset of acyl-CoAs (indicated beneath each CERS). Once formed, ceramide can be metabolized in five different ways: (1) Ceramide can be phosphorylated by ceramide kinase (CERK). (2) Ceramide can be glycosylated by galactosylceramide (GalCer) synthase producing GalCer which can be further metabolized into sulfatides. (3) Attachment of phosphocholine to ceramide yields sphingomyelin (SM) in a reaction catalyzed by SM synthase (SMS). (4) Glycosylation of ceramide by glucosylceramide (GlcCer) synthase followed by galactosyltransferase I (GalTI) produces GlcCer and lactosylceramide (LacCer), respectively. LacCer constitute the foundation for the synthesis of more complex glycosphingolipids including gangliosides GM1 and GM3. (5) Ceramide can be degraded to sphingosine, which in turn can be phosphorylated to sphingosine 1-phosphate (sphingosine1P) and further degraded into hexadecanal and ethanolamine 1-phosphate (ethanolamine1P). The last step is the only known exit route from the sphingolipid pathway.

Pregnancy and delivery were normal. He had no neonatal problems, weighed 2.9&#x000a0;kg, and had a length of 50&#x000a0;cm at birth. Before the age of 2&#x000a0;years, he had three febrile seizures (FS) and two afebrile seizures, presumably generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). Initial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and computerized tomography (CT) scans were normal. To prevent seizures, he was treated with valproic acid (VPA), which rendered him seizure-free. When he was 6&#x000a0;years old, VPA was withdrawn and he remained seizure-free without antiepileptic treatment until the age of 10&#x000a0;years, when VPA was reintroduced due to recurrence of GTCS. He attended a regular school until he was 12&#x000a0;years old, at which time he was diagnosed with learning disabilities and therefore moved to a special class. At the age of 13&#x000a0;years, developmental delay was noticed along with tremor of the hands, and gait disturbances were observed but regarded as side effects of VPA. At the age of 14, he was diagnosed with severe myoclonus. When VPA was substituted by Lamotrigine, cognitive function appeared to improve, but due to unacceptable myoclonia, VPA was reintroduced at the proband's demand. A combination of high dose VPA and oxcarbazepine kept him seizure-free with almost no myoclonia for nearly 2&#x000a0;years. At the age of 20, the frequency of GTCS (predominantly during sleep) and myoclonia increased, and despite administration of several antiepileptic drugs, such as clonazepam, clobazam, levetiracetam, piracetam, and zonisamide, his seizures could not be controlled. Furthermore, withdrawal of oxcarbazepine severely increased the frequency of tonic-clonic seizures. For a period of time, he was is reluctant to go outside due to extreme photosensitivity, which caused frequent falls.</p><p>Laboratory investigations revealed normal hematological indices as well as normal liver and kidney function. Prior to Simvastatin treatment, the plasma level of cholesterol was &#x0003e;10&#x000a0;mmol/L (normal level &#x0003c;5.2&#x000a0;mmol/L) and after treatment, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels were 6.6, 1.4, and 1.5&#x000a0;mmol/L, respectively. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of a muscle biopsy demonstrated discrete myopathic abnormalities with increased fiber variability and an increased number of central nuclei. The inherited mitochondrial disorders, Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers (MERRF), and Neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) were excluded, and genetic tests for the lipid storage disease, Niemann Pick Type C (sequencing of <italic>NPC1</italic> and <italic>NPC2</italic>), were normal. In addition, whole exome sequencing was performed without detecting any disease-causing mutations. A variety of other tests were performed, and the only abnormality detected was a small reduction in the respiratory chain complex I/citrate synthase ratio (0.18 compared to the normal range of 0.19&#x02013;0.54) (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Case report: list of test values</p></caption><table

<italic>CERS2</italic> mutations causing human disorders have, until now, not been reported. This study suggests that <italic>CERS2</italic> haploinsufficiency may cause PME. PMEs are a group of rare and devastating genetic disorders, which are often refractory to conventional treatment. Almost all PMEs reported so far have been associated with recessive inheritance. In the present report, we have confirmed that both parents have two functional <italic>CERS2</italic> alleles, thus the <italic>CERS2</italic> haploinsufficiency must have arisen due to a spontaneous deletion of one of the <italic>CERS2</italic> alleles. Accordingly, fibroblasts isolated from the proband display reduced levels of <italic>CERS2</italic> mRNA, protein, and activity, which cause reduced levels of very long-chain ceramides and SMs.</p><p>Little is known about how CERS2 deficiency might affect cellular functions in humans. In mice, total loss of <italic>CerS2</italic> expression significantly diminishes levels of ceramides and more complex SLs such as C22-24 GalCer, which results in myelin instability and in degeneration of both white and gray matter in the cerebellum.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This suggests that CERS2 activity is important in both neurons and formation of myelin sheath.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<italic>CerS2</italic> null mice also display astrogliosis and microglial activation in both white and gray matter, which may be related to the motor initiation difficulties and myoclonic jerks observed in these mice.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> EEG revealed abnormal fast rhythmic activity (&#x0003e;40&#x000a0;Hz) and, similar to that found in the proband, the null mice display no changes in EEG during myoclonic events.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> To this end, our present studies suggest that <italic>CerS2</italic> null mice also are significantly more sensitive to light than wild-type mice (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>), implying that the light sensitivity in the proband may be caused by impaired CERS2 function.</p><p>Disruption of CERS2 activity in mice not only causes neurological phenotypes but also results in impaired hepatic and lung functions.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In the present proband, <italic>CERS2</italic> haploinsufficiency does not appear to impair liver and kidney function (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). Although <italic>CERS2</italic> is ubiquitously expressed, it is abundantly expressed in both liver and kidney, and found at significantly lower levels in the brain. We therefore propose that <italic>CERS2</italic> haploinsufficiency in humans only has detrimental effects in tissues containing low levels of CERS2, such as the brain, while the remaining CERS2 activity in the liver and kidney may synthesize sufficient amounts of very long-chain SLs to sustain central cellular functions. Alternatively, compensatory mechanisms by other ceramide synthases may exist in vivo, which are not evident in isolated fibroblasts.</p><p>Ablation of <italic>CerS2</italic> in mice results in a small and inconsistent reduction in total GM1<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and in altered biophysical membrane properties.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Consistent with this notion, we also found that <italic>CERS2</italic> haploinsufficiency reduced cholera toxin B staining of the plasma membrane, suggesting that the altered SL composition can ultimately impair membrane microdomain formation and hence plasma membrane functions. Interestingly, such membrane microdomains have been shown to modulate neuronal excitability by controlling neurotransmitter receptor sensitivity and functions,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> which could contribute to the phenotypes displayed by the proband.</p><p>Collectively, we have identified a proband with PME coupled to altered synthesis and composition of very long-chain ceramides and SM. The proband has only one functional <italic>CERS2</italic> allele, reduced <italic>CERS2</italic> mRNA, protein, and activity levels, resulting in impaired synthesis of ceramides and SM containing very long acyl chains, which consequently can affect the formation of membrane microdomains. We foresee that this proband will provide a unique opportunity for addressing the functions of CERS2 and SLs in the development of PME, and lay the foundation for further exploration of the role of SL metabolism in human neurodegenerative disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Michael Witting, Andre Franke and Ingo Helbig from the POPGEN database at Christian-Albrechts-University (Kiel, Germany) for help with database analyses.
