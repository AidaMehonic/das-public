Recently, we demonstrated that GL produced the neuroprotective effects with the suppression of microglia activation and proinflammatory cytokine induction in the postischemic brain with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats and improved motor impairment and neurological deficits. In the present study, we investigated whether GL has a beneficial effect in kainic acid (KA)-induced neuronal death model. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 0.94 nmole (0.2 &#x000b5;g) of KA produced typical neuronal death in both CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. In contrast, administration of GL (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before KA administration significantly suppressed the neuronal death, and this protective effect was more stronger at 50 mg/kg. Moreover, the GL-mediated neuroprotection was accompanied with the suppression of gliosis and induction of proinflammatory markers (COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-&#x003b1;). The anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxic effects of GL were verified in LPS-treated primary microglial cultures and in NMDA- or KA-treated primary cortical cultures. Together these results suggest that GL confers the neuroprotection through the mechanism of anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxic effects in KA-treated brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>glycyrrhizinic acid</kwd><kwd>KA</kwd><kwd>neuroprotection</kwd><kwd>anti-inflammation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The administration of kainic acid (KA), an excitatory amino acid L-glutamate analog, is known to induce typical epileptic behavior by mice in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and to cause neuronal degeneration in limbic structures, such as, the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. KA-induced hippocampal damage may be triggered directly, but it could also be caused by the hyperactivities of excitatory afferent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Consequently, the progress of neuronal death continues for several days in CA1 and CA3 regions after treatment with KA. Previous studies have also shown that the delayed neuronal cell death occurred in CA1 and CA3 regions of KA-administered mice and is associated with the activations of astrocytes and microglia, with apoptotic neuronal death, and with the enhanced productions of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, neuronal cell death detected in mouse hippocampus shows characteristics of both acute and delayed cell death.</p><p>Licorice is a natural product that is used to treat liver disease in traditional Chinese medicine. Glycyrrhizin (GL) is extracted from licorice root and has been used in food industry as a flavoring additive. GL has been reported to have a variety of pharmacological effects, in particular, the anti-inflammatory effect of GL and its derivatives has been reported long time ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that both GL and 18&#x003b2;-glycyrrhetinic acid (18&#x003b2;GA, the metabolite of GL) decrease inflammatory response via phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; (PI3K/Akt/GSK3&#x003b2;) signaling and glucocorticoid receptor activation, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, GL and 18&#x003b2;GA inhibit intracellular ROS production, the inductions of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, COX-2, and IL-1&#x003b2;), and the activations of various transcription factors (NF-kB, PI3K p110&#x003b4;, p110&#x003b3;) in LPS-treated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, GL also inhibits angiogenic activities and the tumor growth in mice, and in the endothelial cells, it decreases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ERK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Recently, accumulating evidences indicate that GL confers neuroprotective effects. Cherng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] reported that GL has a neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in primary neurons, and Kao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] reported the neuroprotective effects of GL and 18&#x003b2;GA in PC12 cells. In addition, it has been shown that GL attenuates rat ischemic spinal cord injury by suppressing inflammatory cytokine induction and HMGB1 secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We have also reported that GL efficiently suppressed infarct formation in the postischemic rat brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and that its neuroprotective effect is accompanied by improvements in motor impairment and neurological deficits, and by the suppressions of microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokine induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The purpose of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of GL in a KA-induced epileptic animal model. Its anti-epileptic and neuroprotective effects were investigated by examining epileptic behavior and neuronal death, respectively, and the underlying protective mechanisms involved were examined in relation to its anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxic effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male BALB/c mice (25-30 g) were housed under diurnal lighting conditions and allowed food and tap water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The animal protocol used in this study has been reviewed by the INHA University-Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (INHA-IACUC) on their ethical procedures and scientific care, and it has been approved (Approval Number INHA-110321-81). Animals were randomly assigned to a KA-treated, KA and GL-treated, or control group.

Briefly, male BALB/c mice (25-30 g) were anaesthetized by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a 2:1 mixture (3.5 &#x000b5;l/g body weight) of ketamine (50 mg/ml) and xylazine hydrochloride (23.3 mg/ml), and then placed on a stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL). Four &#x000b5;l of saline solution containing KA (0.2 &#x000b5;g) was then injected into the right lateral ventricle (stereotaxic coordinates in mm with reference to the bregma were AP, -2.0; ML, -2.9; DV, -3.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] of mice at 0.5 &#x000b5;l/min. After 5 min, the needle was removed over 3 min to minimize backflow.

Fixed brain was incubated with 30% sucrose overnight and sections (30 &#x000b5;m) were prepared by using a vibratome. Immunological staining was performed following standard procedure. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:200 for anti-Neu N antibody (MAB377, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and anti-ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), and 1:150 for anti-GFAP antibody (DB Bioscience, San Jose, CA). After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, sections were incubated with anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for anti-Neu N and anti-GFAP, or with anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for anti-Iba-1 in PBS for 1hr at room temperature and visualized using the HRP/3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) system. Numbers of NeuN-positive cells in 0.01 mm<sup>2</sup> (0.1&#x000d7;0.1 mm<sup>2</sup>) for CA1 or in 0.0225 mm<sup>2</sup> (0.15&#x000d7;0.15 mm<sup>2</sup>) for CA3 areas were obtained by counting 12 photographs, 3 photographs per experiment.

After 2 weeks, microglia were then detached from the flask by mild shaking and filtered through a nylon mesh to remove astrocytes.

Dissociated cortical cells were plated at a density of approximately 4&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells per well (five hemispheres per 24-well poly(d-lysine)- and laminin-coated plate). Cultures were maintained without antibiotics in MEM containing 5% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 21 mM glucose. At day 7 in vitro (DIV 7), when astrocytes had reached confluence underneath neurons, cytosine arabinofuranoside was added to a final concentration of 10 &#x000b5;M, and cultures were maintained for 2 days to halt microglial growth. Fetal bovine serum and glutamine were not supplemented from day 7, and media were changed every other day after day 7. Cultures were used at DIV 12 to 14.</p></sec><sec><title>NMDA, KA, or glutamate treatment</title><p>Primary cortical cells were treated with serum-free MEM or HEPES controlled salt solution (HCSS) containing 50 &#x000b5;M NMDA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 10 min, 100 &#x000b5;M KA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 12 hrs, or 100 &#x000b5;M glutamate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 1 hr.

Seizure progression from 0 to 150 min after KA administration was scored using Sperk's seizure scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These fixed epileptic behaviors intensified rapidly and the highest level of reaction was observed 90 min after KA administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). To examine the neuroprotective effect of GL, it was administered at 30 min prior to KA (10 or 50 mg/kg, i.p.) and seizure behavior was assessed at the same time points as in KA-administered control animals. Although the severity and duration of seizure behavior were generally lower in the GL-administered group than in KA-administered controls, differences were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>It has been known that KA administration leads to neuronal death in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. To determine degrees of neuronal death, brain tissue slices containing hippocampus were stained with anti-NeuN antibody at 2 days after KA treatment. In saline-treated control animals, mean numbers of NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells in the CA1 (0.1&#x000d7;0.1 mm<sup>2</sup>) and CA3 (0.15&#x000d7;0.15 mm<sup>2</sup>) regions (indicated as black box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) of the hippocampus were 99.3&#x000b1;18.7 (n=12) and 178.7&#x000b1;9.1 (n=12), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, E, F</xref>) and in the KA-administered controls, mean numbers of NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells were 42.9&#x000b1;6.9 (n=12) and 51.7&#x000b1;9.1 (n=12), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, E, F</xref>). When 10 mg/kg of GL was administered 30 min prior to KA, KA-induced neuronal death was significantly suppressed, and mean numbers of NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells were 53.5&#x000b1;9.4 (n=12) and 97.2&#x000b1;9.7 (n=12), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, D, F</xref>). KA-induced neuronal death was further suppressed by the administration of 50 mg/kg of GL and corresponding mean numbers of NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells were 63.0&#x000b1;8.9 (n=12) and 140.8&#x000b1;13.5 (n=12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E, F</xref>). When GL (50 mg/kg) was administered 30 min after KA injection, KA-induced neuronal death was also significantly suppressed although the effects appeared to be slightly weaker than that observed in 30 min pre-administered animals (data not shown). These results indicated that GL suppressed KA-induced neuronal death in the mouse hippocampus.</p></sec><sec><title>GL suppressed KA-induced astrocyte and microglia activations in CA1 and CA3</title><p>We examined whether GL affected inflammatory processes in KA-injected mice. Anti-GFAP and anti-Iba-1 antibodies were used to access astrocyte and microglial activations, respectively. In saline-treated control animals, immunostaining with anti-GFAP antibody revealed that astrocyte cell bodies were small and their processes were long and thin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, at 2 days after KA injection, astrocyte cell bodies were enlarged and their processes were shorter and thicker, that is, they possessed the characteristics of activating astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). At 4 days after KA administration, astrocytes were activated further and exhibited the characteristic star-shape of activated astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, when 10 mg/kg GL was injected 30 min prior to KA, astrocyte activation at 4 days after KA administration was remarkably suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) and it was further suppressed by 50 mg/kg GL, adopting morphology of the resting state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Staining with anti-Iba-1 antibody (a marker of cells of myeloid origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]) showed that in saline-treated control animals, Iba-1 -positive cells in the hippocampus were ramified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). However, 2 days after KA injection, cell bodies of Iba-1-positive cells were enlarged and cytoplasmic processes were thicker and shorter in CA1 and CA3, displaying activated morphology of microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). In contrast to astrocyte activation, staining with anti-Iba-1 antibody detected fewer number of Iba-1-positive cells exhibiting activated morphology at 4 days after KA administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). In 10 mg/kg GL-administered animals, number of Iba-1-positive cells exhibiting activated morphology was significantly suppressed at 2 days post-KA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>) and it was almost completely suppressed by 50 mg/kg GL, wherein cell bodies of Iba-1-positive cells were thin and their cytoplasmic processes were ramified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>). These results suggest that the activations of microglia/macrophage and astrocytes in the hippocampus of KA-administered animals were suppressed by GL.</p></sec><sec><title>GL suppressed KA-induced proinflammatory marker production</title><p>Next, we examined whether the inhibition of astrocyte and microglia activation by GL is accompanied by the suppression of proinflammatory marker production in the hippocampus. Levels of proinflammatory markers in KA-injected animals were assessed by immunoblotting with anti-COX-2, anti-iNOS, and anti-IL-1&#x003b2; antibodies. Protein samples were prepared from both CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions (indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) one day after KA injection. COX-2 expression was notably increased both in CA1 and CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). After treatment with 10 mg/kg of GL, COX-2 expression was significantly suppressed and it was further suppressed by 50 mg/kg GL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). iNOS and IL-1&#x003b2; expressions were also notably increased in KA-injected hippocampi and suppressed dose-dependently by GL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). These results indicate that KA-induced proinflammatory marker productions were suppressed by GL.</p></sec><sec><title>GL suppressed the LPS-induced activation of microglial cells</title><p>To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of GL, the GL-dependent suppression of microglial activation was examined in primary microglial cultures. Cells were stimulated with LPS (0.1 &#x000b5;g/ml) for 24 hrs with and without GL co-treatment, and nitrite production was measured. GL co-treatment reduced LPS-induced nitrite production dose-dependently; maximum inhibition was achieved at a GL concentration of 1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In addition, GL dose-dependently repressed the inductions of proinflammatory markers (Cox-2, TNF-&#x003b1;, and iNOS) in LPS-treated primary microglial cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B-E</xref>). In contrast, &#x003b1;-tubulin levels were not changed at any GL concentration tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). These results indicate that GL suppresses LPS-induced microglial activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Anti-excitotoxic effects of GL in primary cortical cultures</title><p>GL-mediated suppression of neuronal death in KA-administered animal prompted us to examine an anti-excitotoxic effect of GL in primary cortical cultures. Since glutamate-mediated excitotoxic cell death is the main neurotoxic mechanism in epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], NMDA, glutamate, and KA were used to induce excitotoxic damage in primary cortical cultures and to examine the anti-excitotoxic effects of GL. Severe neuronal damage was observed 2 hrs after NMDA treatment (50 &#x000b5;M, 10 min) in primary cortical cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, co-treatment with 0.5 mM of GL significantly reduced LDH release, and treatment with 1 mM of GL further reduced LDH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Similar neuroprotective effects were also observed in KA (500 &#x000b5;M, 12 hrs)- or glutamate (100 &#x000b5;M, 1 hr)-treated primary cortical cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6B, C</xref>), although, the protective efficacy of GL differed for the different treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Together these results indicate that anti-excitotoxic effects in neurons contributes to the neuroprotective effects of GL in the postischemic brain.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study shows that GL has a strong neuroprotective effect in KA-administered mice. GL treatment was found to decrease neuronal death in the hippocampus, inhibited astrocyte and microglia activation in KA-administered mouse brain, and suppressed inflammatory marker induction. In addition, GL significantly suppressed NMDA-, KA-, or glutamate-induced neuronal death, indicating that GL confers anti-excitotoxic effect. In our previous studies, we have described inhibitions of microglia activation and concomitant inflammatory cytokine inductions by GL in the postischemic brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The present result, together with our previous report, suggests that neuroprotective effect of GL is, at least in part, attributable to its anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxic functions.</p><p>Recently, a number of studies have indicated that inflammation might be a consequence and also a cause of epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It has been reported that inflammation contributes substantially to delayed brain damage after acute injury and that it detrimentally affects neurological outcome following KA-induced epileptic seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In particular, astrocytes and microglia are activated and first upregulate proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF, and IL-6) and cytokine receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and subsequently, an ensuing inflammatory process is induced not only in astrocyte and microglia but endothelial cells and peripheral immune cells migrated into the brain parenchyma. A numbers of studies have shown anti-inflammatory effects of GL in animal disease models, which is in accord with our findings. For example, GL was found to alleviate inflammatory lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], to reduce LPS-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and to alleviate ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma in BALB/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Regarding the molecular mechanism underlying anti-inflammatory effect of GL, blocking the activations of NF-kB, PI3K, p110&#x003b4;, and p110&#x003b3; has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, inhibition of ROS formation and redox-sensitive signaling (nuclear factor-kB (NF-&#x003ba;B), Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase) by GL has been shown to be responsible for suppression of pro-inflammatory gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Recently, the suppression of HMGB1 release by GL has also been reported to reduce apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines induction after transient spinal cord I/R injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and in animal model of MCAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Although GL fails to inhibit proconvulsant effect of KA, we found that the anti-excitotoxic effect of GL might also contribute to its neuroprotective effect in a KA-induced seizure animal model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). It has been reported that in rat hippocampal slices and primary neuronal cultures, GL can suppress glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and reduce cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which corroborates our results. In addition, carbenoxolon, a synthetic derivative of GL, has also been reported to block NMDA receptors and to impair long-term potentiation in mouse hippocampal slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It is of note that we also confirmed neuroprotective and anti-excitotoxic effects of carbenoxolon in stroke animal model and in KA-induced epilepsy animal model (Luo et al., unpublished data). Although, carbenoxolon has been known to function as a gap junction uncoupler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of GL need further study.</p><p>In terms of its neuroprotective potency, Hwang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] reported that the neuroprotective effect of roasted licorice against ischemic damage is greater than raw form and it might be through antioxidant effect. We have reported that SNMC, a glycyrrhizin-containing preparation developed for chronic liver disease, has a marked neuroprotective function in the postischemic brain via its anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and SNMC shows significantly higher neuroprotective potency compared to an equivalent dose of pure glycyrrhizin, in terms of reducing infarct volume and improving neurological deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Considering robust neuroprotective effects of GL in KA-induced animal seizure model in the present study and in MCAO animal model in our previous reports, investigation on the improvement of therapeutic potency of GL by modification and by producing formulation is worth pursuing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This research was financially supported by Inha
