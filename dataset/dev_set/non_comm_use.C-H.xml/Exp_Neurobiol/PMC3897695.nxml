Validation of the tools assessing the quality of the sibling relationship would be the first essential step for conducting neurobiological and psychosocial studies related to the sibling relationship. However, to the best of our knowledge, no sibling relationship assessment tools have been empirically validated in Korean. We aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Lifespan Sibling Relationship Scale (LSRS), which is one of the most commonly used self-report questionnaires to assess the quality of the sibling relationship. A total of 109 adults completed a series of self-report questionnaires including the LSRS, the mental health subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 36 version 2 (SF36v2), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SLS), and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MC-SDS). The internal consistency, subscale intercorrelations, one-week test-retest reliability, convergent validity, divergent validity, and the construct validity were assessed. All six subscale scores and the total score of the LSRS demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's &#x003b1;=0.85-0.94) and good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.77-0.92). Correlations of the LSRS with the SF36v2 mental health score (r=0.32, p=0.01) and with the SLS (r=0.27, p=0.04) supported the good convergent validity. The divergent validity was shown by the non-significant correlation of the LSRS with the MC-SDS (r=0.15, p=0.26). Two factors were extracted through factor analysis, which explained 78.63% of the total variance. The three Adult subscales loaded on the first factor and the three Child subscales loaded on the second factor. Results suggest that the Korean version of the LSRS is a reliable and valid tool for examining the sibling relationship.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sibling relationships</kwd><kwd>validity</kwd><kwd>reliability</kwd><kwd>lifespan sibling relationship scale</kwd><kwd>psychometrics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source country="KR">Ewha Womans University</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source country="KR">Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare</funding-source><award-id>A112009</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although sibling relationships have received relatively less attention compared to parent-child relationships or marital relationships, they are considered increasingly important for the following reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. First of all, sibling relationships are very common in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. According to the national survey conducted in South Korea in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], 74.4% of married women had two or more children. Secondly, sibling relationships last longer than parent-child relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It has been reported that siblings tend to maintain their fellowships throughout their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A United States national survey showed that 50% of adults contacted or met with their siblings at least once a month, and two thirds of them considered their siblings as one of their best friends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, as the average human lifespan lengthens, the duration of these sibling relationships would last longer. Lastly, siblings spend a lot of time together in childhood, which may play a critical role in the developmental process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As the number of working parents has been increasing, siblings spend more time with each other than with their parents and parents often leave the older siblings to take care of the younger ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Sibling relationships have huge impact on one's behavioral and psychological development not only during childhood but throughout the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The experiences of teaching and caregiving between siblings in childhood have positive effects on both the older and younger siblings' cognitive, linguistic, social, and psychological development, and give a better understanding of other people's feelings and perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In general, adolescents have a tendency to escape from the influence of their parents, but siblings still provide advice about life plans and personal problems during this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In fact, adolescents considered siblings more important in terms of companionship, intimacy, and nurturance than parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has also been reported that the quality of sibling relationships in adolescence is closely related to friendship and self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. During adulthood, siblings can advise each other on life's major events, assist in making decisions, and help to increase morale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Even when the frequency of contact decreases due to responsibilities for their own families, intimacy tends to be maintained in most cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Contacts between siblings would become frequent again when their children grow up and become independent. In old age, siblings are someone to rely on, supporting each other practically and psychologically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and many choose siblings as the first person to ask for help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. People who had more interactions with siblings in old age felt a greater degree of control of their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and people whose siblings are still alive reported higher motivation than people whose siblings have died [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Evidence that sibling relationships are closely related to mental health and adaptation throughout the entire life has accumulated. A meta-analysis of 34 studies about children and adolescents indicates that more warmth and less conflict in sibling relationships are associated with less internalizing and externalizing problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. According to a longitudinal study conducted over a span of 30 years, poor sibling relationship in childhood was a risk factor for major depressive disorder in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Adults with good sibling relationships had a lesser degree of loneliness and depression, and had high self-esteem and satisfaction with their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In a research on older individuals, even in a case of low frequency of sibling interactions, qualitative aspects of the interaction predicted mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Early life experiences have been reported to have a significant impact on the brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In a postmortem study, it was noted that individuals who had been exposed to child abuse had a decreased mRNA expression of glucocorticoid receptor and an altered pattern of DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These epigenetic changes may induce alterations in brain chemistry and morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Using structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, decreased volume of corpus callosum has been found in maltreated children with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In a study using proton MR spectroscopy, abused children with PTSD showed a decrease in the ratio of N-acetylaspartate to creatine, indicating a decreased level of neuronal viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Positive experiences, as well as negative ones, have also been reported to affect the neurodevelopmental process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Maternal support and warmth in early childhood was positively correlated with larger hippocampal volumes at school age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Given these findings, the sibling relationship, one of the most important social experiences early in life, is likely to be a critical modulator of the brain development, although there have not yet been studies specifically investigating these relationships.</p><p>Although the sibling relationship is considered as an important research topic in the field of psychiatry, psychology, and neuroscience as detailed above, the number of quantitative tools that measure the quality of sibling relationships is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Moreover, none of them have been formally validated in Korean. Among the questionnaires to assess the sibling relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the Lifespan Sibling Relationship Scale (LSRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] by Riggio, is one of the most widely used self-report tools which has an advantage of comprehensively measuring all aspects of the quality of and attitudes towards sibling relationships during both childhood and adulthood, with established reliability and validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, this scale has useful characteristics such as short administration time. The current study sought to evaluate psychometric properties of the Korean version of the LSRS, which can be used as a tool to measure the quality of sibling relationships for neuroscientific and psychosocial research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Adults over 18 years of age were recruited through advertisements.

They were asked to fill out information about their socio-demographic characteristics including age, gender, marital status, and the number of siblings along with a series of self-report questionnaires. In addition, participants had to choose one sibling who has had the greatest impact on them either in a positive or negative way. The average time spent on the questionnaire was 30 minutes. Participants received small gifts that worth about 4 US dollars in compensation. To check the test-retest reliability, 19 participants completed the LSRS twice within an interval of a week.

For consistency, only one sibling was chosen to respond to the question items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The degree of agreement or disagreement with 48 statements was rated using a 5-point Likert scale. The LSRS includes 6 subscales, each consisting of 8 items. Subscales of Child Affect and Adult Affect measure emotional aspects in childhood and in adulthood, respectively (love, affection, pleasure, etc.), and subscales of Child Behavior and Adult Behavior measure the degree of interactions through behaviors (phone call, visit, sharing secret, etc.) in their respective stages. Subscales of Child Cognitions and Adult Cognitions measure aspects of belief in sibling relationships (closeness and importance of the relationship) in their respective stages. Six subscale scores and the total score are calculated; the higher the score, the more positive attitudes they have toward sibling relationships.</p></sec><sec><title>Medical outcomes study-short form 36 version 2 (SF36v2)</title><p>The SF36v2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] is a self-report tool that assesses one's level of physical and mental health in the last 4 weeks.

Pearson correlation coefficient between the MC-SDS total score, which is known to be unrelated to the quality of, or attitude towards sibling relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and the LSRS total score was also calculated to test the divergent validity.</p><p>Validity of the LSRS was further examined in a 2&#x000d7;2 ANOVA model which included the participant sex, chosen sibling sex, and their interaction term as independent variables, and LSRS adult subscale score as a dependent variable.</p><p>Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test of sampling adequacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and Bartlett's test of sphericity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] were performed to decide whether the data are adequate for factor analysis, and principal component analysis with varimax rotation was performed to examine the factor structure of the LSRS. The number of factors was decided based on the criterion of eigenvalue &#x02265;1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and the scree plot test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].

Compared to the questionnaires with only a few items which were designed to simply assess the overall quality of the sibling relationship, the LSRS comprehensively assesses the affective, cognitive, and behavioral components of the relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Moreover, majority of scales assess the sibling relationship of particular periods. For example, the widely used Adult Sibling Relationship Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] was designed to assess the sibling relationship of adulthood only. Using the LSRS, on the other hand, the quality of, and the attitude toward sibling relationship during both childhood and adulthood can be assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated the reliability and validity of the Korean version of the LSRS. In the present study, the Korean version of the LSRS showed good psychometric properties in adults. The reliability was demonstrated by satisfactory internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The validity was shown by measures of the convergent validity and divergent validity.</p><p>Women have been documented to report higher quality of and positive attitude toward adulthood sibling relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our study also showed this sex difference in the attitude toward sibling relationship, women reporting higher adult subscale scores. Same-sex siblings evaluated their sibling relationship quality and their attitude toward the sibling relationship during adulthood more favorably, compared to different-sex siblings. This finding is also consistent with that in the prior report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Two-dimensional structure was supported by the findings, as was in Riggio's study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], with both the scree plot and Kaiser criterion suggesting the two-factor solution. Three subscales measuring the sibling relationship quality during adulthood loaded on the first factor, which could be labeled as 'adulthood sibling relationship quality.' The other three subscales measuring the quality of the sibling relationship during childhood loaded on the second factor, which could be labeled as 'childhood sibling relationship quality.' This two-factor construct of the scale is conceptually meaningful, underlying dimensions being consistent with the original conceptual model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The LSRS has not been translated and validated in other languages, which partly reflects the lack of research that examines the role of sibling relationship. For this reason, it was not possible to compare the current results to other validation work in different languages. Compared with the results reported in the original development and validation paper of the LSRS by Riggio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], our results were similar overall.</p><p>There are limitations of this study that should be considered interpreting the results. Participants were mainly young adults in their 20s, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Young adults in their 20s experience rapid changes in their sibling relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Going to college, siblings share less moments and communicate with each other less frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Experiencing this transition period with regard to the sibling relationship, this age group can barely be representative to other age groups. Thus further studies are needed to examine whether our results also hold in other age groups. Relatively modest sample size also warrants caution in generalizing the findings. Due to the lack of validated sibling relationship assessment questionnaire in Korean, comparison between the Korean version of the LSRS and other sibling relationship assessment questionnaires of the Adult Sibling Relationship Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] or Sibling Relationship Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] could not be performed. Although the Sibling Relationship Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] has been used as an assessment tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] in dissertations, the formal standard validation process was not performed.</p><p>The validated Korean version of the LSRS with good psychometric properties as shown in the present study, would be useful in many future studies. Important psychosocial studies that examine the associations of the quality of, and the attitudes toward the sibling relationship with temperament and character [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], parental divorce and remarriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and psychological maltreatment in childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] could be replicated in a Korean population. For individuals with serious and persistent mental health problems such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, the support level of their siblings is one of the most important factors associated with the prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Evaluating the attitude toward the sibling relationship of the brothers/sisters of the mentally-ill and its impact on patient's prognosis would be an important research topic, which has not yet been studied. Information from such studies would also be used for the proper clinical care of the patients with mental disorders. This validated scale would also be used as an essential tool in research investigating the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the associations of the quality of the sibling relationship during childhood with later mental health problems and social adaptation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by the Global Top 5 Program, Ewha W.
