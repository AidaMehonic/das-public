In this study we describe a new model system to investigate pulmonary melioidosis <italic>in vivo</italic> using bioluminescent-engineered bacteria in a murine respiratory disease model. Studies were performed to validate that the stable, light producing <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> strain JW280 constitutively produced light in biologically relevant host&#x02013;pathogen interactions. Hairless outbred SKH1 mice were used to enhance the ability to monitor <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> respiratory disease, and were found to be similarly susceptible to respiratory melioidosis as BALB/c mice. This represents the first demonstration of <italic>in vivo</italic> diagnostic imaging of pulmonary melioidosis permitting the detection of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> less than 24&#x02009;h post-infection. Diagnostic imaging of pulmonary melioidosis revealed distinct temporal patterns of bacterial colonization unique to both BALB/c and SKH1 mice. Validation of these model systems included the use of the previously characterized capsule mutant, which was found to colonize the upper respiratory tract at significantly higher levels than the wild type strain. These model systems allow for high resolution detection of bacterial pulmonary disease which will facilitate studies of therapeutics and basic science evaluation of melioidosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bioluminescent diagnostic imaging</kwd><kwd>hairless mouse model</kwd><kwd>upper respiratory tract infection</kwd><kwd>pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd><italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic></kwd><kwd>melioidosis</kwd><kwd>capsular polysaccharide</kwd><kwd>intranasal infection</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="32"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="8232"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen responsible for the potentially fatal disease melioidosis. <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> has naturally developed the resistance to numerous classes of antibiotics, and presently there is no licensed vaccine for immunoprotection. Susceptible hosts acquire melioidosis through several possible routes of infection including ingestion, percutaneous inoculation, and inhalation (Currie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2000</xref>; Inglis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2000</xref>). The potential for respiratory acquisition of fatal melioidosis from a bioweapon has contributed to the identification of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> as a category B Select Agent organism (Rotz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2002</xref>).</p><p>The lung is the most commonly affected organ in human melioidosis (Wiersinga et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2006</xref>), and radiological imaging approaches have identified the liver and spleen as additional key sites of infection (Muttarak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2008</xref>; Lim and Chong, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2010</xref>). Mice have been used as an excellent surrogate model which allow for studies of bacterial colonization at all major sites of infection, including the lung, liver, and spleen, approximating numerous aspects of clinical melioidosis (Warawa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2010</xref>). Dissemination and progression of disease in the lung are poorly characterized phenomena in both clinical melioidosis and the mouse model due to the lack of diagnostic tools to monitor disease progression. Bioluminescently engineered <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> were recently used to study respiratory melioidosis in mice, in which <italic>in vivo</italic> detection of bacteria was limited to the upper respiratory tract (URT) with no bioluminescent detection of pulmonary disease (Owen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2009</xref>). In the same study, <italic>ex vivo</italic> bioluminescence was detected additionally in the liver, spleen, and NALT in euthanized animals. A goal of this current study was to establish the ability to detect bacterial colonization of the lung <italic>in vivo</italic>, early in the infectious process, in order to facilitate both therapeutic and basic science investigations of mechanisms of virulence employed by <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>.</p><p>Several virulence determinants have been identified as critical to the virulence of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in animal models including Type 3 Secretion, Type 6 Secretion, LPS, and capsular polysaccharide (CPS I; Deshazer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1998</xref>; Reckseidler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2001</xref>; Atkins et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2002</xref>; Stevens et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2004</xref>; Warawa and Woods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2005</xref>; Burtnick et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2011</xref>). Of these, all but LPS have been additionally demonstrated to be important for murine respiratory melioidosis (Pilatz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2006</xref>; Warawa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2009</xref>). We have previously characterized the role of the capsular polysaccharide in respiratory disease and found that a capsule operon mutant is attenuated 10<sup>1.8</sup> fold and facilitates efficient initial pulmonary colonization, but that capsule is not critically required for dissemination of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> to the liver and spleen (Warawa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2009</xref>). In developing the ability to perform diagnostic imaging of respiratory melioidosis, we included use of the capsular polysaccharide mutant to attempt to further characterize the role for this virulence determinant in pulmonary disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and media</title><p>All strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

In contrast, the oscillating total flux of the capsule mutant survivors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>D, right panel) trended upward, and at 14&#x02009;days post-infection, a bacterial burden of 9.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup> (&#x000b1;1.52&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup>) CFU/lung was observed.

The approach we selected was use of optical imaging strategies using <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> strains engineered to constitutively produce bioluminescence. Bioluminescence offers the advantage over fluorescent for detection of weak signals due to the enzymatic amplification of signal, and bioluminescence offers the added benefit of detecting only metabolically active bacteria as the production of light requires energy from the cell. The <italic>luxCDABE</italic> operon from <italic>P. luminescens</italic> allows for light production in the absence of addition of foreign substrates. This is in contrast to the eukaryotic luciferases which require exogenous addition of D-luciferin. We preferentially selected use of the <italic>lux</italic> operon as <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> are known to traffic in intracellular environments <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the <italic>lux</italic> operon allows for stable access to endogenous luciferase substrate using the accessory <italic>luxCDE</italic> gene products.

The authors do not comment on the absence of morbid disease when infecting with 3.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> organisms, however we hypothesize that the small delivery volume (12&#x02009;&#x003bc;l) may have contributed to a minimal pulmonary infection, and similarly the low bacterial burden reported in the lung (Owen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2009</xref>). Thus, <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> strain 08 may represent a low virulence strain, or may indicate that infections limited to the URT do not lead to morbid disease due to the importance of the lung in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> virulence.

At a late time point, the capsule mutant was found to proliferate less efficiently than wild type in J774A.1 cells, and this reduction in fitness was associated with an increase in relative light production. Interestingly, the relative light production of the capsule mutant in the mouse lung was similarly higher than the wild type strain in both BALB/c and SKH1 mice. Prolonged incubation of a capsule mutant in cultured macrophages was previously reported to be associated with a decrease in capsule mutant viability (Wikraiphat et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2009</xref>), and the data from this current study suggests that the same mechanism affecting capsule mutant viability in cell culture models may be exerted <italic>in vivo</italic> during pulmonary disease.</p><p>This study represents the first characterization of SKH1 mice to investigate melioidosis. SKH1 mice are a hairless mouse model useful for studying a variety of dermatologically important events such as burn models, UV sensitivity, skin aging, and also offer the ability to enhance optical diagnostic imaging for both bioluminescent and fluorescence detection strategies (Benavides et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2009</xref>). The effect of fur on masking photon emission has been previously estimated to account for up to a 10-fold loss in signal in fluorescence imaging approaches (Nishijo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2009</xref>). In this present study, we found that fur also contributes to the noise level which also affects sensitivity of detection, where shaved BALB/c mice have a greater than eight-fold higher noise level than SKH1 mice. Shaving was performed in preference to use of depilatory creams as it has been reported that depilatory creams allow for complete hair regrowth over a 14-day period while shaving results in much slower hair regrowth (Faia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2008</xref>).</p><p>Unlike nude mice, hairless SKH1 are considered to be an immunocompetent mouse strain which we hypothesized would represent an excellent new model for bioluminescent-based diagnostic imaging of melioidosis. In this study, outbred SKH1 were found to be similarly sensitive to respiratory melioidosis as inbred BALB/c mice. Interestingly, SKH1 mice were found to be more resistant to the virulence of the capsule mutant, such that the capsule mutant attenuation was higher in the SKH1 mouse model than we previously reported in the BALB/c model. Thus, SKH1 mice may allow for higher resolution determination of attenuation when investigating roles of bacterial virulence determinants. We have also demonstrated that SKH1 mice provide a benefit over BALB/c mice in that they: (i) do not have to be shaved, (ii) have no residual fur to mask photon emission or create noise, and (iii) allow for higher levels of lung colonization of wild type <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>. The most significant caveat we observed in the SKH1 model is the lack of splenic pathology when infected with wild type <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> even though the bacterial burden in SKH1 mice is similar to that of BALB/c mice. We previously characterized the role of the capsular polysaccharide in stimulating a proinflammatory response in the liver and spleen of BALB/c mice associated with wild type-specific elevations in histopathologic damage in these tissues (Warawa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2009</xref>). Splenic pathology is a hallmark of clinical melioidosis (Laopaiboon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2009</xref>), and it is therefore a concern that SKH1 mice do not allow for a full study of the host response to melioidosis in the spleen. SKH1 mice possess a retroviral leukemia virus which interrupts the <italic>hr</italic> gene resulting in the autosomal recessive hairless phenotype, and have been reported to possess altered subpopulations of na&#x000ef;ve and memory T cells relative to other common mouse strains (Schaffer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2010</xref>). While symptoms of leukemia do not exhibit until mice reach adulthood, it is possible that T cell sub-population alterations in 8-week-old SKH1 mice lead to the lack of the host response triggering splenic pathology. Thus, SKH1 mice represent an excellent model for the study of pulmonary disease kinetics during <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infection, but caution should be taken if this strain is used to study the host response in disseminated tissues.</p><p>Optical imaging strategies for the detection of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in mice appear to be limited to detection of pathogen specifically in the lung. We estimated the level of detection of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in the lung to be 10<sup>6.3</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>6.8</sup>&#x02009;CFU in SKH1 mice, and 10<sup>6.6</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>7.4</sup>&#x02009;CFU in BALB/c mice. At terminal disease, <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> burdens do not exceed 10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;CFU in the liver or spleen of BALB/c or SKH1 mice with the exception of the livers of BALB/c-infected mice which may exceed 10<sup>6</sup>&#x02009;CFU. It is possible that some punctate visualization of hepatic colonization may be detected during terminal disease, but the ability to monitor disease kinetics in the liver or spleen during murine melioidosis may not be achievable with optical diagnostic imaging. Engineering of new <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> strains that produce higher levels of light may allow for limited detection in the spleen, but it is likely that the close proximity of the liver to the lung, the significant pigmentation of the liver, and the relatively higher pulmonary colonization rates may mask the hepatic signal. Some strains of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> also exhibit altered organ colonization patterns, such as the NCTC 13178 strain which does not colonize the lung at high titer, even when delivered intranasally (Barnes and Ketheesan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2005</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>lux</italic>+ <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> 08 strain did not colonize the lung at high titer when introduced intranasally (Owen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2009</xref>), but it is unclear whether this is due to the low delivery volume or low strain virulence, as discussed above. Therefore not all <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> strains may be amenable to bioluminescent engineering for the <italic>in vivo</italic> detection of pulmonary disease.</p><p>Diagnostic imaging was used in this study to identify unique patterns of bacterial expansion in the lungs of BALB/c and SKH1 mice. BALB/c mice were found to be associated with a biphasic expansion while SKH1 mice were more typically associated with a low initial rate of expansion prior to rapid exponential expansion. Net bacterial expansion in the lung can be affected by several variables including: (i) variation in bacterial growth rates in different host niches, (ii) host immune-mediated clearance of bacteria, and (iii) reduction of lung colonization due to dissemination to other key sites of infection. Additional studies will be required to characterize the contribution of each of these variables on the biphasic expansion in BALB/c mice and lag expansion in SKH1 mice. Importantly, this study highlights how diagnostic imaging can critically impact our understanding of how melioidosis progresses in the lung in a mouse strain specific manner. Respiratory disease in the mouse model is typically very acute with symptoms of lethal pneumonia presenting within 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;days post-infection. The findings of this study suggest that use of arbitrary time designations to identify stages of disease (e.g., 24&#x02009;h post-infection designation of early disease) may not allow for meaningful study of host&#x02013;pathogen interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. Diagnostic imaging is therefore a critically important tool to aid in high resolution definition of host&#x02013;pathogen interactions in the study of both host and pathogen responses during infection.</p><p>A phenotype identified for the capsular polysaccharide <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> mutant in this study was the elevated colonization of the URT during infection. The high degree of nasal cavity colonization for both the wild type and capsule mutant strains had been an unexpected observation, with the nasal cavity bacterial burden exceeding that of the lung in the majority of instances of diagnostic imaging. This finding suggests that the murine nasal cavity is a primary colonization niche for <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> delivered by the i.n. route, while we have not found evidence to suggest that clinical melioidosis is associated with similar URT carriage. The reason for a potential difference between human and murine URT carriage may be due to opportunistic colonization in mice due to the high relative surface area, where mice have been reported to have over 100-fold greater relative surface area than the human nasal cavity (Warawa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2010</xref>). Alternatively, normal resident flora specific to the human URT may outcompete <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in interspecies competition, a reported phenomenon for other respiratory pathogens (Lysenko et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2005</xref>). Additional studies are required to characterize the murine-specific tolerance for URT-related melioidosis and the role of capsular polysaccharide in directing elevated URT colonization, which may shed light on our general understanding of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> colonization of mucosal surfaces.</p><p>In conclusion, we have characterized the first <italic>in vivo</italic> pulmonary diagnostic imaging model of melioidosis using a fully virulent, stable, bioluminescent strain of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>. We validated the ability to detect <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in the lung of infected mice in both BALB/c and SKH1 mice, with the higher level of sensitivity being achieved in SKH1 mice. Different patterns of bacterial expansion in the lung were observed in the two mouse strains suggesting that altered kinetics of host response and/or dissemination profiles may affect disease in these strains. We also identified the high propensity for URT colonization by <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> with the intact capsular polysaccharide modulating the level of colonization of the nasal cavity. These findings highlight the importance of using diagnostic imaging to characterize <italic>in vivo</italic> models of melioidosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, NIAID.
