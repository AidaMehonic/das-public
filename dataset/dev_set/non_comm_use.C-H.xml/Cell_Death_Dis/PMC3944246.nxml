We hypothesized that the inhibitory action of let-7e on regulation of MMP9 expression could represent a crucial mechanism during differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). ASCs were differentiated with all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid (ATRA) to promote differentiation, and the effect of let-7 silencing during differentiation was tested. Results indicate that ASCs cultured with ATRA differentiated into cells of the epithelial lineage. We found that ASCs cultured with ATRA or transfected with miRNA let-7e expressed epithelial markers such as cytokeratin-18 and early renal organogenesis markers such as Pax2, Wt1, Wnt4 and megalin. Conversely, the specific knockdown of miRNA let-7e in ASCs significantly decreased the expression of these genes, indicating its vital role during the differentiation process. Using luciferase reporter assays, we also showed that MMP9 is a direct target of miRNA let-7e. Thus, our results suggest that miRNA let-7e acts as a matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) inhibitor and differentiation inducer in ASCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs)</kwd><kwd>miRNA let-7e</kwd><kwd>MMP9</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are attractive targets for clinical applications.

Cellular changes associated with MET include major changes in the expression of several genes related to the conversion of the extracellular matrix,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> such as matrix metalloproteinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> and the redistribution of the cytoskeletal structure, finally leading to the establishment of the typical apical&#x02013;basal polarity of epithelial cells. These morphological changes result from a specific expression profile of surface markers, transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs).</p><p>The miRNAs are small (&#x0223c;22&#x02009;nt), regulatory, noncoding RNA molecules that control the expression of their target mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level by binding to the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR). There is a well-established biotechnology system for studying the role and targets of miRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> and also <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using synthetic miRNAs and transfection methods, we can mimic or suppress the action of specific miRNAs and study the consequences in different models. The miRNAs are involved in the differentiation of diverse cell lineages&#x02014;among others, skeletal muscle cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Interestingly, critical signaling pathways during differentiation, such as the Wnt pathway,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> are mainly controlled by the expression of specific miRNAs. miRNA family let-7 (let-7) is considered as a global regulator of differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> The let-7 is barely detected during embryonic development, but it increases significantly as tissues differentiate and it is mainly detected in the adult kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> In addition, let-7e plays a pivotal role in stem cell differentiation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> and its loss results in reversion of embryogenesis and dedifferentiation. Decreased levels of miRNA let-7e have also been associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in renal cell carcinoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> possibly because of its effects on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). It has previously been shown that miRNA let-7b downregulates MMP9 activity through indirect effects by inhibition of basigin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> By using <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the 3&#x02032;UTR of MMP9, a predicted binding site of miRNA let-7e was indicated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the direct effect of miRNA let-7e on MMP9 expression has not been investigated to date.</p><p>Thus, as miRNA let-7e adopts a pivotal role during stem cell differentiation, and MMP9 may be a potential direct let-7e target, we hypothesized that the inhibitory action of let-7e on the regulation of MMP9 expression could represent a crucial mechanism during renal organogenesis. In this study we show that let-7e is induced during renal epithelial cell differentiation from ASCs and that the direct inhibition of MMP9 by miRNA let-7e plays a key role during this process.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>ASCs have multilineage potential and phenotypical characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells</title><p>ASCs obtained from male Swiss CD1 mice were isolated and expanded <italic>in vitro</italic> in control media. In order to confirm their multilineage potential, these cells were cultured with adipogenic media for 15 days and with osteogenic media for 20 days. ASCs cultured under adipogenic conditions formed lipid vacuoles that are considered to be typical features of the adipogenic lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, left panel). ASCs cultured under osteogenic conditions showed depositions of mineralized matrix, a characteristic of the osteogenic lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, right panel). These observations confirmed the multilineage potential of ASCs. Cellular composition was analyzed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Approximately 90&#x00025; of the population was positive for the mesenchymal stem cell markers CD44, Sca-1 and CD29, and negative for CD34 and CD45.</p></sec><sec><title>ATRA promotes morphological differentiation of ASCs</title><p>Phase-contrast microscopy analysis of ASCs cultured with 5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid (ATRA) for 11 days showed a gradual conversion into a more epithelial polygonal phenotype with respect to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, upper panel). A flattened fibroblast-like morphology was observed in untreated cells, whereas ATRA stimulation gradually changed cell morphology into an epithelial, cobblestone-like phenotype. Changes in cytoskeletal organization were assessed by immunofluorescence staining of the actin fiber network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, lower panel). Cells showed an organized cytoskeletal network with dense actin fibers at the edges when cultured with ATRA for 11 days. Untreated controls maintained the equal actin fiber distribution throughout the whole cell, typical of the mesenchymal phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>ATRA promotes differentiation of ASCs toward the epithelial lineage</title><p>Upregulation of Pax2, an intermediate mesoderm marker, and also upregulation of WT1, Wnt4, Six2 and megalin, all markers of the metanephric mesenchyme, were observed when ASCs were cultured in media with a physiological concentration of glucose and supplemented with ATRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>ASCs also showed a significant induction of the epithelial markers cytokeratin-18 (CK18) and E-cadherin (E-CAD), whereas mRNA expression of vimentin, a classical mesenchymal marker, was downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Expression of CK18 was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). CK18 appeared as a perinuclear brown staining when ASCs were cultured for 11 days under differentiation conditions.

As we wanted to test the effect of let-7e knockdown on differentiation markers, which did not show a significant increase until day 4 of differentiation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), this particular time point was chosen to deliver anti-miRNA let-7e. A schematic overview is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>The expression of miRNA let-7e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and nephrogenic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) was evaluated. The miRNA let-7e transfection significantly upregulated let-7e expression and induced the expression of the metanephric mesenchyme markers Pax2, Wnt4, Wt1 and megalin as well as the epithelial marker CK18. In contrast, miRNA let-7e knockdown blocked the increase in early nephrogenic and epithelial markers observed during ASC differentiation with ATRA.</p></sec><sec><title>miRNA let-7e targets the 3&#x02032;UTR of MMP9</title><p>The overexpression of miRNA let-7e in ASCs cultured under untreated conditions provoked the downregulation of MMP9 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). MMP9 activity was also reduced, as observed in zymographic gels. Both pro-form and active MMP9 were downregulated compared with untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).</p><p>In order to determine whether MMP9 was regulated by let-7e through direct binding of the miRNA to the 3&#x02032;UTR, we transfected either a control vector (control), a wild-type construct (3&#x02032;UTR-MMP9) with an intact let-7e-binding site or the mutated construct (3&#x02032;UTR-mutMMP9) in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). We chose HEK293 because this cell type can be transfected very easily and is a good starting point for experiments that include luciferase constructions and co-transfection with miRNAs. Cells were co-transfected with either control miRNA (C) or miRNA let-7e (&#x0002b;let-7e). Luciferase activity showed a significant decrease in cells treated with let-7e, suggesting that let-7e binds to the 3&#x02032;UTR of MMP9. In contrast, the mutation of the let-7e-binding site in the 3&#x02032;UTR of MMP9 led to an increase in luciferase activity, confirming the involvement of let-7e in MMP9 inhibition.</p><p>Similar results were found using ASCs under untreated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Co-transfection of let-7e in undifferentiated ASCs reduced luciferase activity using the wild-type reporter construct for the 3&#x02032;UTR of MMP9 containing the intact let-7e-binding site. To confirm these data, we used ASCs differentiated with ATRA for 8 days and co-transfected the cells with either anti-let-7e or a control antimiR. The data showed a significant increase in luciferase activity by blocking let-7e during differentiation. These results further corroborate the notion that let-7e has a regulatory effect on MMP9 expression.</p><p>We also checked whether the increased expression of MMP9 provoked by miRNA let-7e silencing was directly correlated with MMP9 activity. <italic>In situ</italic> zymography experiments were performed and gelatinolytic activity was measured according to the levels of fluorescence emitted through digestion of FITC-labeled gelatine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). The results showed increased gelatinase activity when miRNA let-7e was blocked. Finally, we tested the role of MMP9 on epithelial cell features by assessing E-cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Both ASCs (left panel) and NRK-52e cells, an established kidney tubular epithelial cell line (right panel), were used to detect E-cadherin expression by western blot analysis. ASCs treated with ATRA showed a significant increase in E-cadherin expression compared with untreated cells. This increase was blocked by the addition of recombinant MMP9. The same results were obtained when using NRK-52e cells, thus confirming the inhibitory effect of MMP9 on epithelial cell characteristics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ASCs are pluripotent cells that can differentiate mainly into cells of the same lineage commitment, such as osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Nevertheless, various studies proposed that ASCs can overcome this lineage commitment and differentiate into renal epithelia. Renal epithelial differentiation of ASCs was first observed after transplantation of human ASCs into ischemic mouse kidneys. ASCs were readily integrated into the tissue and differentiated into epithelial-like cells, as corroborated by the expression of CK18.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup>
<italic>In vitro</italic> studies also showed ASC differentiation toward renal epithelium that could be induced by factors secreted from renal tubular epithelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup></p><p>Moreover, Brzoska <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> described an <italic>in vitro</italic> protocol using ATRA in order to differentiate ASCs into epithelial cells that expressed increased levels of the epithelial marker CK18 as well as decreased amounts of the mesenchymal marker vimentin.</p><p>In the present study, ASCs cultured with ATRA gradually increased the expression of different early nephrogenic markers, such as Pax2, Wt1, Wnt4, Six2 and megalin. At the same time, epithelial markers CK18 and E-CAD were upregulated, whereas the mesenchymal marker vimentin was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Most interestingly, stem cell differentiation reflected the process of kidney organogenesis during development. Therefore, <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of stem cells might be expected to mimic the expression pattern of differentiation markers of the development from the intermediate mesoderm to the metanephric mesenchyme, and finally to the renal epithelium. ATRA treatment increases the expression of Pax2, one of the first genes expressed during kidney embryogenesis in the intermediate mesoderm and the first indicator of renal lineage determination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> ATRA-treated cells also express Wt1 and Six2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> which are the main transcription factors expressed in nephron precursors, and are essential for correct kidney formation during development. Wt1 is readily upregulated in the metanephric mesenchyme together with Wnt4,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> a component of the Wnt pathway, and both play a crucial role during the transition of the mesenchyme to renal epithelia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, the membrane glycoprotein megalin adopts a pivotal role in determining kidney functional responses in renal epithelial cells. Stem cell differentiation may also be monitored by determining epithelial <italic>versus</italic> mesenchymal markers. During <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation and MET, epithelial markers CK18 Griesche <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> and E-CAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> were described to be upregulated, whereas mesenchymal markers such as vimentin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> were concomitantly downregulated. After treatment with ATRA, cells undergo significant morphological changes. The typical fibroblastic, mesenchymal-like morphology of ASCs gradually changes toward a more epithelial-like, polygonal morphology. These morphological and cytoskeletal changes represent the key process during MET, allowing the cells to adopt the characteristic epithelial cell apical&#x02013;basal polarity.</p><p>The let-7 family of miRNAs is classically involved in stem cell differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> It was previously shown that miRNA let-7, together with miRNA-24, adopts a specific role in osteogenic differentiation through the PDGF pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Interestingly, miRNA let-7 is barely detectable in the embryonic kidney, but is significantly expressed in the adult kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Moreover, let-7 expression is clearly decreased in pathophysiological states of cellular dedifferentiation such as renal cell carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> In our study, we were able to show clearly that miRNA let-7e was significantly increased in ASCs differentiated with ATRA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This increase was concomitant with an increased expression of Pax2, Wt1, Wnt4, megalin and CK18. In contrast, blocking of miRNA let-7e in differentiated cells reversed these gene expression patterns, indicating the involvement of miRNA let-7e in renal epithelial cell differentiation.</p><p>MMPs play a key role in the differentiation of diverse tissues and organs throughout the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> During renal organogenesis, MMP2 and MMP9 are mainly synthesized by renal mesenchyma when the ureteric bud interacts with the metanephric mesenchyme. Interestingly, only MMP9, but not MMP2, was shown to play a crucial role during <italic>in vitro</italic> renal organogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> MMP9 degrades denatured collagen (gelatin), native collagen types I, IV, V and IX and elastin with high specificity. Therefore, it was speculated that MMP9 is involved in epithelial differentiation because of its role in extracellular matrix remodeling, a central step in MET.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> MMP9 also has the ability to degrade other nonstructural molecules such as E-CAD as well as other cell-to-cell adhesion molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> Degradation of E-cadherin through MMP9 miRNAs promotes the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cellular dedifferentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Our results further corroborate these findings, as addition of recombinant MMP9 to differentiated epithelial cells (from ASC or NRK-52e cell line) significantly reduced the protein levels of E-CAD. In this regard, the blocking of MMP9 may possibly be a key event in the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. We conclude that MMPs are crucial players during differentiation in both MET and EMT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Therefore, there is a strong need for tight regulation of both the expression and activity of MMPs. Regarding the regulation of MMP9, miRNAs have been reported to act at the post-transcriptional level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> Moreover, MMP9 mRNA is classified in the miRWalk database as a predicted target gene of miRNA let-7e,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> and a recent report showed the indirect relationship of MMP9 and members of the let-7 family through regulation of the MMP inducer basigin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Our results point rather to a direct interaction of miRNA let-7e with MMP9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) shown by luciferase reporter assays using full-length constructs of the 3&#x02032;UTR of MMP9 and mutated constructs, deficient at the let-7e-binding site.</p><p>In summary, we found that miRNA let-7e adopts a pivotal role during the differentiation of ASCs to epithelium. We further characterized MMP9 as a direct target of miRNA let-7e and obtained mechanistic insights into epithelial cell differentiation from ASCs. To conclude, miRNA let-7e induces ASC epithelial differentiation by modulating MMP9 expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Isolation and expansion of mouse ASCs</title><p>Male Swiss CD1 mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA) were used for the extraction of subcutaneous adipose tissue, as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> All donors were 3&#x02013;4 months old and were killed by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation.
