acid (ALA) supplementation during <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation (IVM) and
culture (IVC) on nucleic maturation and embryo development of pigs.
Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were incubated in IVM medium containing
different concentration of ALA (25, 50 and 100 &#x003bc;M) for 44 h. After <italic>in
vitro</italic> maturation, nuclear maturation of oocytes were evaluated by
aceto-orcein stain. Mature oocytes with 50 &#x003bc;M ALA were fertilized and cultured
in IVC medium with ALA (25, 50 and 100 &#x003bc;M) during early-embryogenesis (48 hours
after fertilization). Then, embryos were cultured with 25 &#x003bc;M ALA during early
embryogenesis and/or late embryogenesis (120 hours after early-embryogenesis).
In results, oocyte maturation were significantly increased by 50 &#x003bc;M ALA
treatment groups compared with control groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).
Treatment of 25 &#x003bc;M ALA during early-embryogenesis enhanced cleavage rate of
embryo compared with other groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), whereas
formation and total cell number of blastocyst had no significant difference.
Similarly, cleavage rate of embryos were increased by 25 &#x003bc;M ALA supplement
during early- or late-embryogenesis than ALA treatment both stage of
embryogenesis (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), but did not influence to blastocyst
formation. Interestingly, total cell number of blastocyst were enhanced in ALA
treatment group during early-embryogenesis. These findings indicated that ALA
supplement enhance the nuclear maturation of oocyte and embryo development,
however, excessive ALA could negatively influence. Therefore, we suggest that
ALA is used for improvement of <italic>in vitro</italic> production of mammalian
embryo and further study regarding with functional mechanism of ALA is
needed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Alpha-linolenic acid</kwd><kwd><italic>In vitro</italic> maturation</kwd><kwd><italic>In vitro</italic> culture</kwd><kwd>Oocyte</kwd><kwd>Embryo</kwd><kwd>Pig</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="CrossRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016R1D1A1B03931746</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>crossmark</meta-name><meta-value>2017-06-30</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec01"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are one of fatty acid that have two or more
double bonds and exist as cis- or trans-isoform following by structure of double
bonds. The follicles, oocytes, and spermatozoa contain large amount of PUFAs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Homa &#x00026; Brown, 1992</xref>). Especially, biochemical
composition of follicular fluid determines microenvironment in follicles for oocyte
growth and maturation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Khalil et al., 2013</xref>)
and PUFAs influence to oocyte maturation, fertilization, and subsequent development
through altering the biochemical composition of follicular fluid (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bilby et al., 2006</xref>). <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Fouladi-Nashta et al. (2009)</xref> had reported that fatty acid
composition in granulosa cells were altered by dietary or supplementation in culture
medium, and it had influence to oocyte maturation, and subsequent development in
<italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Omega-3, a one of PUFAs,
regulates variety of reproductive function in mammals (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Wathes et al., 2007</xref>). Quality of oocyte and embryo were
enhanced by their type and ratio in composition of fatty acid (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Wonnacott et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; n-3 18:3), a one of omega-3 fatty acid, is mainly
contained in chloroplast of plant (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Marei et al.,
2009</xref>). As an essential fatty acid, ALA was not synthesized in mammalian
body including human, cow, and pig. And it must be supplied from foods (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Sturmey et al., 2009</xref>). <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ambrose et al. (2006)</xref> had reported that dietary ALA in cows
increased the size of pre-ovulatory follicles and reduced pregnancy loss. Also,
supplementation of ALA during bovine oocyte maturation decreased intracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) level (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Marei et al.,
2012</xref>). Many studies that are involved with effect of ALA by dietary or
<italic>in vitro</italic> supplement on female reproductive events in cows were
reported. However, a few studies in pigs were reported.</p><p>Pigs are important animal not only for agriculture, but also for research of human
disease as a disease model animal (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Pratt et al.,
2006</xref>). Because pigs have genetic, anatomical, and physiological
similarity compared to human, it was used in various field of research for disease
model and production of transgenic animals (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lin et
al., 2009</xref>). Successful <italic>in vitro</italic> production (IVP)
technique of porcine embryos were required for various researches, however, quality
of embryo derived from IVP in pigs was lower than embryo derived from <italic>in
vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et al., 2004</xref>). In
<italic>in vitro</italic> environment, porcine oocytes have a lower maturation
rate in both of nuclear and cytoplasm than <italic>in vivo</italic> mature oocytes
(<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Elahi et al., 2016</xref>). To improve these problems, many researchers
supplied the antioxidants and fatty acid into maturation or culture medium of
oocytes, and fatty acids play a role as an energy source of oocytes, storage of
energy for metabolism, and embryo development (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">McKeegan &#x00026; Sturmey, 2011</xref>). Based on these studies, we expected that
function of ALA positively influenced to oocyte maturation and subsequent
development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
additional ALA during <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation (IVM) and culture (IVC)
on nuclear maturation and embryo development in pigs.</p></sec><sec id="sec02"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec02-01"><title>1. <italic>In vitro</italic> maturation (IVM)</title><p>All procedures that involved the use of animals were approved by the Kangwon
National University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(KIACUC-09-0139). Ovaries were collected from slaughtered gilts at local
slaughter house and transferred into the laboratory in 0.9% (w/v) sterilized
saline within 2 h. The cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were aspirated from
antral follicles with 3-6 mm in diameter using 10 cc syringe with 18-gauge
needle. After aspiration, COCs with homogeneous cytoplasm and compact cumulus
layer were selected and incubated in medium-199 (Invitrogen, MA, USA) containing
10% (v/v) porcine follicular fluid (pFF), 10 IU/mL human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG; Intervet), 10 ng/mL luteinizing hormone (LH; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA), 10 ng/mL follicle stimulating hormone (FSH; Sigma-Al-drich) and 10 ng/mL
epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma-Aldrich) with ALA, which was diluted using
ethanol (final concentration: 0.9%), at 38.5&#x02103;, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> condition for
22 h. Because hCG is known that it can improve cytoplasmic maturation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">K&#x00105;tska-Ksi&#x00105;&#x0017c;kiewicz, 2006</xref>), we added hCG
into IVM medium. Then, they were subsequently incubated using hormone-free
medium-199 with ALA at 38.5&#x02103;, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> condition for 22 h. </p></sec><sec id="sec02-02"><title>2. Evaluation of nuclear maturation</title><p>Aceto-orcein stain method was used to evaluate nuclear maturation stage of
porcine oocytes that were incubated with different concentration of ALA during
IVM. Hyaluronidase was treated into mature COCs and cumulus cells were removed
by gentle pipetting using pasture pipette. Denuded oocytes were fixed in acetic
alcohol solution (acetic acid:ethanol; 1:3; v/v) for 48 h, at room temperature
(RT). And oocytes were was stained by 1% (w/v) aceto-orcein at RT for 7 min. The
morphology of nuclear was observed under light microscope. Metaphase II (MII)
stage oocytes were classified as mature oocyte.</p></sec><sec id="sec02-03"><title>3. <italic>In vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF)</title><p>Mature COCs were treated by 0.1% (v/v) hyaluronidase for reduction of binding
between cumulus cells. And they placed in 50 &#x000b5;L drop of modified tris-buffered
medium (mTBM) containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich).
For hyperactivation of spermatozoa, fresh boar semen were placed in mTBM
containing 0.4% (w/v) BSA and 0.39 mg/mL caffeine (Sigma-Aldrich) and they
diluted at a final concentration of 6&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> spermatozoa/mL. Activated
sperm inseminated into prepared COCs and co-incubated at 38.5&#x02103;, 5%
CO<sub>2</sub> condition for 6 h. </p></sec><sec id="sec02-04"><title>4. <italic>In vitro</italic> culture (IVC)</title><p>After fertilization, cumulus cells and spermatozoa surrounding zona pellucida of
fertilized oocytes were completely removed by gentle pipetting and 70-80 embryos
were cultured in 4-well dishes (SPL Life Science, Korea) with 650 &#x000b5;L porcine
zygote medium-3 (PZM-3) containing 0.3% (w/v) BSA (Sigma-aldrich) at 38.5&#x02103;, 5%
CO<sub>2</sub> condition for 48 h (early-embryogenesis). Then, culture
medium was exchanged to fresh medium and subsequently incubated for 120 h in
same culture condition (late-embryogenesis). For comparison of embryo
development between short- and long-term ALA treatment at 168 h after IVF,
cleavage rate, blastocyst formation, and total cell number of blastocyst were
checked at 168 h after IVF.</p></sec><sec id="sec02-05"><title>5. Total cell number of blastocyst</title><p>To evaluate total cell number, blastocyst stage embryos were fixed in 4% (v/v)
paraformaldehyde at room temperature (RT) for 3 min. And nuclear of blastocyst
was stained by 1 &#x000b5;g/mL bisbenzimide H 33342 trihydrochloride (Hoechst 33342;
Sigma-Aldrich) at RT for 30 min in dark room and observed using fluorescent
microscope.</p></sec><sec id="sec02-06"><title>6. Statistical analysis</title><p>All numerical data representing each parameter were analyzed using the
Statistical Analysis System Software (SAS, version 9.4). Data were presented
means &#x000b1; SEM and comparisons among treatment groups were conducted by least
significant difference (LSD) tests using a generalized linear model (GLM) in the
SAS package. A value of <italic>p&#x0003c;</italic>0.05 was considered to indicate a
statistically significant difference.</p></sec><sec id="sec02-07"><title>7. Experimental designs</title></sec><sec id="sec02-07-01"><title>1) Experiment 1: Effect of ALA on nuclear maturation of porcine
oocytes</title><p>To evaluate effect of ALA on nuclear maturation of oocytes, porcine oocytes were
incubated using IVM medium with different concentration of ALA (0, 25, 50, and
100 &#x000b5;M; Sigma-aldrich) for 44 h and stage of nuclear maturation was observed
using aceto-orcein stain method. In experiment 1, 50 COCs were used in each
replication and total 3 replication were conducted. </p></sec><sec id="sec02-07-02"><title>2) Experiment 2: Effect of ALA during early-embryogenesis on embryo
development</title><p>Based on result in experiment 1, mature oocytes with 50 &#x000b5;M ALA were fertilized
and cultured using IVC medium containing different concentration of ALA (0, 25,
50, and 100 &#x000b5;M) for 48 h after fertilization (early-embryogenesis). Then,
culture medium without ALA was exchanged and embryos were subsequently cultured
for 120 h.</p></sec><sec id="sec02-07-03"><title>3) Experiment 3: Effect of ALA during early- and/or late-embryogenesis on
embryo development</title><p>In pigs, the early embryos develop in oviduct and they are transported into the
uterus at 48 h after fertilization. Therefore, we expected that embryo
development was differently influenced before or after at 48 h after
fertilization. To investigate the effect of ALA during embryogenesis, mature
embryos with ALA were cultured in IVC medium with or without 25 &#x000b5;M ALA for 48 h
and subsequently incubated using IVC medium with or without 25 &#x000b5;M ALA for 120 h.
Treatment groups were named as following: T1, without ALA in early- and
late-embryogenesis; T2, with ALA in late-embryo-genesis; T3, with ALA in
early-embryogenesis; T4, with ALA in early- and late-embryogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec03"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec03-01"><title>1. Effect of ALA on nuclear maturation of porcine oocytes</title><p>The Effect of ALA during IVM on nuclear maturation of porcine oocytes was shown

<italic>in vivo</italic> environment. Oocyte maturation in <italic>in
vivo</italic> environment was occurred in follicles that contain follicular
fluids and influenced by nutrients in follicular fluid. And composition of
follicular fluid are changed by dietary nutrients. Therefore, this study was
conducted to investigate effect of additional ALA on nuclear maturation and embryo
development in pigs. Our findings showed that nuclear maturation of porcine oocytes
were enhanced by 50 &#x000b5;M ALA treatment, whereas it was reduced by treatment of 100 &#x000b5;M
ALA. In addition, supplement of 25 &#x000b5;M ALA during early-embryogenesis icreased
cleavage rate of embryo that were mature with 50 &#x000b5;M ALA, however, blastocyst
formation and total cell number were not influenced by treatment of ALA.
Interestingly, 25 &#x000b5;M ALA treatment during early-embryogenesis enhanced cleavage rate
and blastocyst formation, on the contrary, ALA treatment during both of early- and
late-embryogenesis decreased embryo development and quality.</p><p>Fatty acid is considered as potential metabolic substrate in oocyte and early stage
embryo and required as energy source for metabolism in embryo during
pre-implantation in pigs and cows (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Sturmey et al.,
2009</xref>). <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Wakefield et al. (2007)</xref> had
reported that maternal supply of omega-3 PUFA influence to mature of oocyte through
distribution of mitochondria, level of intracellular calcium, and increase of ROS
during oocyte maturation in follicle. Also, cis-unsaturated fatty acid stimulates
generation of ROS and lipid peroxidation in human spermatozoa (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aitken et al., 2006</xref>). These studies indicated that
supplementation of fatty acids were associated with generation of ROS in various
type of cells and it affected to cellular process such as oocyte maturation, embryo
development, and survival via stimulation by ROS. ROS, which is produced by normal
metabolism of the cell, is caused oxidative stress as a crucial signal molecule
(<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Al-Gubory et al., 2010</xref>). Excessive ROS
level in cells induce inactivation of enzymes, DNA fragmentation, dysfunction of
mitochondria, and apoptosis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kowaltowski &#x00026;
vercesi, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Exposure of ROS reduces the oocyte maturation, fertilization and embryo development
both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. In mouse oocytes,
exposure of citrinin toxin during maturation increased ROS generation and apoptosis,
and decreased maturation rates and blastocyst formation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). In results of present study, nuclear
maturation of porcine oocytes were enhanced by 50 &#x000b5;M ALA treatment and these results
were corresponded to research that was reported by <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Marei et al. (2009)</xref>. However, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al.
(2016)</xref> had reported that nuclear maturation of porcine oocytes were
enhanced by 100 &#x000b5;M ALA that was diluted by culture media including 0.4% BSA,
epidermal growth factor, and insulin. Thus, we expected that different result might
be attributed to dilution method of ALA and composition of culture media used in
each experiment. During the porcine oocyte maturation, intracellular glutathione
(GSH) was increased by treatment of ALA (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al.,
2016</xref>) and <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Marei et al. (2012)</xref> had
reported that ALA treatment reduced ROS level in bovine oocyte. GSH plays an
important role in prevent of damage by oxidative stress (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Nagai, 2001</xref>). Based on these results, our results indicated
that ALA treatment during porcine oocyte maturation might enhance the nuclear
maturation via reduction of oxidative stress. In addition, reduced nuclear
maturation of porcine and bovine oocyte by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
inhibitor during <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation was recovered by ALA treatment
(<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Marei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) and these results suggested
that ALA was involved with signal pathway regarding to nuclear maturation of
oocytes.</p><p> Supplementation of 50 &#x000b5;M ALA in IVM medium increased nuclear maturation of porcine
oocytes, however, 100 &#x000b5;M ALA treatment reduced oocyte maturation during IVM. Similar
to our findings, 100 and 200 &#x000b5;M ALA decreased nuclear maturation of bovine oocytes,
whereas 50 &#x000b5;M ALA increased oocyte maturation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Marei
et al., 2009</xref>). <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Wakefield et al.
(2007)</xref> had reported that supply of omega-3 fatty acid by dietary
increased ROS level in murine oocytes and these results suggested that excessive ALA
suppressed oocyte maturation by inducing of oxidative stress.</p><p>Measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> in rabbit embryos when cultured with palmitic acid
during the development of rabbit embryos shows that embryos can oxidize fatty acids
even in the single-cell stage, In particular, it was reported that the production of
CO<sub>2</sub> increased from the 4 cell stage (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Khandoker &#x00026; Tsujii,1998</xref>). This indicated that fatty acids added
during embryonic development were used as an energy source (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Sturmey et al., 2009</xref>), and thus the addition of 25 &#x003bc;M ALA
during embryonic development in this study may have served as an energy source
during embryonic development. However, treatment with 100 &#x003bc;M ALA suggests that
oxidative stress may be induced in the oocyte and inhibit development of the
embryo.</p><p><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2016)</xref> had reported that 100 &#x003bc;M ALA
treatment during IVM of porcine oocytes enhanced embryonic development after
parthenogenesis of oocytes. In present study, ALA was supplied into both of
maturation and subsequent development process of porcine oocytes. Additional
supplementation of 100 &#x003bc;M ALA during IVC of porcine embryo negatively affected to
cleavage rate of embryo after IVF. These different results suggested that embryo
development of porcine oocytes were influenced by period of ALA treatment and
fertilization method. Interestingly, total cell number of control group in
experiment 3 was decreased compare with control group in experiment 2. We expected
that it was influenced by seasonal effect. Experiment 2 was conducted during winter,
whereas experiment 3 was conducted during summer. </p><p>It is known that oxidative stress is a major obstacle to the development of embryos
and that excessive ROS can negatively affect embryo development (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Guerin et al., 2001</xref>). Antioxidants are added to
reduce excessive ROS production during embryonic development, and antioxidants have
been reported to be effective in embryonic development such as mice, pigs, and cows
by lowering the ROS level in embryos (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi,
2012</xref>). <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2015)</xref> had
reported that 200 &#x003bc;M &#x003b3;-tocotrienol was reduced during embryonic development and
decreased ROS and improved embryonic development. This is similar to the results of
increased cleavage rates and total cell number in the T3 group treated with ALA
during early embryonic development in this study. However, when 400 &#x003bc;M &#x003b3;-tocotrienol
was treated, the embryo apoptosis was increased as well as ROS in the embryo, This
is similar to the results of the reduced cleavage rates and total cell number of
blastocysts in the T4 group treated with ALA during both early and late embryonic
development during after of fertilization development in this study, as a result,
excessive ALA treatment had a negative effect on oocytes.</p><p>In this present study, supplementation of additional ALA in IVM and IVC medium
enhanced nuclear maturation of oocyte and embryo development in pigs. However, high
concentration of ALA (100 &#x000b5;M in IVM; 50 and 100 &#x000b5;M in IVC) negatively affect to
oocyte maturation and embryo development. Therefore, our findings suggest that ALA
could improve <italic>in vitro</italic> production systems of porcine embryo and
additional ALA in dietary may enhanced reproductive performance of pigs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant
