At this summit, more than 50 participants began to develop a model of what health coaching could become and how it could support health and wellness through sustainable lifestyle changes. Many of these principals are eloquently captured in Dr Lawson's editorial, &#x0201c;The Four Pillars of Health Coaching: Preserving the Heart of a Movement.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p>We are honored to have as guest editors Ruth Wolever, PhD, and Karen Lawson, MD, ABIHM.

These teams, which offer a diverse group of healthcare professionals ranging from nurses to dieticians to health coaches, have the patient at the center of care and often prove to be surprisingly cost effective. For example, Sara Horowitz, founder and Executive Director of Freelancers Union in Brooklyn, New York, has helped organize a clinic with two full-time doctors and eight health coaches focusing on health, wellness, and prevention. She contends that the involvement of health coaches will help patients stay healthy and avoid costly hospital stays that could result from failing to follow a treatment plan. Steven Counsell, MD, from the Center for Aging Research at Indiana University uses a team approach combining transitional and primary care to involve patients in an individualized treatment plan. He says, &#x0201c;It's not just the medical stuff &#x02026; unless you uncover the psychosocial issues&#x02014;screen for depression or cognitive impairment, lack of social support or health literacy issues&#x02014;these things send the best-laid plans out the window.&#x0201d; And Tina Sullivan, RN, nursing director of adult medical services at Bronson Healthcare Group in Michigan, advocates a patient-centered &#x0201c;teach-back&#x0201d; method that allows patients to tell their caregivers what they do and don't understand and encourages them to ask questions, a strategy that tells caregivers what's working and what needs to be reinforced.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>Health coaching is here to stay and covers a broad range of specialties. <italic>Global Advances in Health and Medicine</italic> aims to publish original articles that highlight this growing movement and promote collaboration.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lawson</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>
