The findings of the study showed that the overall client satisfaction level with the health services rendered at the hospital was 77%. Satisfaction was reported to be highest (82.7%) with the way the doctors examined them and on the other hand dissatisfaction was reported to be highest (46.9%) by respondents with the time spent to see a doctor.

Therefore, the Hospital management should understand these weak service areas and plan for a better service delivery.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hospital</kwd><kwd>Outpatient Department</kwd><kwd>inpatient</kwd><kwd>satisfaction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Client satisfaction is the level of satisfaction that clients experience having used a service. It therefore reflects the gap between the expected service and the experience of the service, from the client's point of view. Measuring client or patient satisfaction has become an integral part of hospital/clinic management strategies across the globe. Moreover, the quality assurance and accreditation process in most countries requires that the satisfaction of clients be measured on a regular basis (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Asking patients what they think about the care and treatment they have received is an important step towards improving the quality of care, and ensure local health services are meeting patients' needs (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It is an established fact that satisfaction influences whether a person seeks medical advice, complies with treatment and maintains a continuing relationship with practitioners (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Donabadian, arguably the leading theorist in the area of quality assurance, has emphasized that Client satisfaction is of fundamental importance as a measure of the quality of care because it gives information on the provider's success at meeting those client values and expectations, which are matters on which the client is the ultimate authority (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>In the prior years when hospitals were symbols of humanitarian efforts for community welfare, accountability for performance was of little concern. Today however, people are increasingly concerned about hospital's performance because: -1) Hospitals use an increasing proportion of scarce community resources. 2) There are increasing questions about quality and effectiveness. (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Moreover, addressing those service aspects of healthcare that consumers most readily appreciate, such as access, provider relationship, availability of information and opportunity for participation can influence health care quality outcomes (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>A recent study from Bangladesh reported that the most powerful predictor for client satisfaction with health services was provider behavior, especially respect and politeness (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>It is indicated that health care systems in most developing countries suffer from serious deficiencies in financing, efficiency, equity and quality and are poorly prepared to meet these challenges (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>An in-depth study of the Iringa district of Tanzania, a poor rural area, showed that patients bypassed low quality facilities in favor of those offering high quality consultation and prescriptions, staffed by more knowledgeable physicians and better stocked with basic supplies (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In Ethiopia the low level of socio-economic development resulting in one of the low standard of living, poor environmental conditions and low level of social services has been the major causes for a poor health status of the people (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Several studies conducted in Out Patient Departments of different hospitals in Ethiopia revealed client satisfaction level ranging from 22.0% in Gondar to 57.1% in Jimma (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Long waiting hours during registration, visiting of Doctors after registration, laboratory procedures and re-visiting of the Doctor for evaluation with laboratory results failure to obtain prescribed medications from the hospitals' pharmacies and difficulty to locate different sections were the frequently faced problems affecting utilization leading to dissatisfaction (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>This study would have an important input in assessing the level of clients' satisfaction on outpatient as well as inpatient health care services, identify the factors affecting the clients' satisfaction, and provide a recommendation on an improved health service delivery that will be helpful to fill research knowledge gaps which ultimately contributes to enhance quality of patient services in the hospital and improve the level of clients' satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Subjects</title><p>A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted to assess the perceived levels of clients' satisfaction with health services rendered at Jimma University Specialized Hospital, which is located 350KM Southwest of Addis Ababa. JUSH is a referral and teaching hospital running annual budget of Birr more than 20 million with bed capacity of over 450 and total staff exceeding 550.It provides services for approximately 9000 inpatient, 5000 accident and emergency cases and 80,000 outpatient attendants each year.</p><p>All clients visiting the hospital for health services from March 1/2010 to March 8/2010 were the source population. Sample size(n) was determined based on the assumption of 50% satisfaction level, Expected margin of error (d) of 0.05 and with 95% confidence level (Z<sub>&#x003b1;/2</sub>) and 10% contingency for non-response. The study population was selected using systematic random sampling technique. According to the data obtained from the Hospital the annual cases seen at OPD is estimated to be 80000 excluding accidents and emergencies and the annual admission rate is 9000.Therefore the proportional sample size for inpatient was 40 and shared equally among Internal medicine, Surgery and Gynecology &#x00026; Obstetrics wards. For Outpatient services the sample size was 382 and divided among OPDs of the above mentioned Departments. As a result, 422 clients were involved in the study. Questionnaire was administered to every 5<sup>th</sup> of Outpatient clients who received treatment and completed their visit and similar exit interview was administered to every other inpatient clients on their discharge date.</p><p>Structured questionnaire was developed in English and the interview was administered by medical interns who can speak Afan Oromo fluently, after orientation training on purpose of the study and proper administration of questioners was conducted for one day. The questionnaire was designed to obtain information on socio demographic characteristics of respondents and their satisfaction level with the different components of the Hospital's services which included the availability of drugs and supplies, information provision by the health workers, waiting time to get the services, courtesy and respect of the health workers, and cleanliness of waiting areas, toilets and wards of the hospital.</p><p>Data consistency and completeness was checked throughout the data collection, data entry and analysis. Data were coded and entered into computer using SPSS version 16.0 software. In the analysis of client satisfaction the very satisfied and very dissatisfied were categorized to satisfied and dissatisfied groups because the numbers of the respondents in the very satisfied and dissatisfied were small. Frequency distribution, percentages and Chi-square test were calculated for selected variables to check associations at 5% level of significance. Prior to this study an official letter from the college of public health and medical sciences was written to the Hospital to conduct the study and verbal consent from the Medical director, and Head nurses was secured. Informed consent was also obtained from the clients after explaining the purpose of the study.</p><p>The following Operational definitions were used during the conduct of this study;</p><p><bold>Patient waiting time</bold>: The interval between departure from the proceeding outpatient station and receiving service at the next outpatient station.</p><p><bold>Outpatient station</bold>: The different part of outpatient department, registration station, weighing station, examination room laboratory, and dispensary etc&#x02026;</p><p><bold>Consultation time:</bold> The time spent discussing health matter with one's physician.</p><p><bold>Satisfaction</bold>: Attaining one's need or desire.</p><p><bold>Very satisfactory:</bold> Above one's expectation.</p><p><bold>Satisfactory:</bold> Just one's expectation.</p><p><bold>Dissatisfactory:</bold> Below one's expectation.</p><p><bold>Very dissatisfactory</bold>: Fail to meet one's expectation usually leading to disappointment.</p><p><bold>Assessment:</bold> Is the process by which the characteristics and needs of clients, groups or situations are evaluated or determined so that they can be addressed. The assessment forms the basis of a plan for service or actions.</p><p><bold>Service:</bold> any activity undertaken to meet the social needs.</p><p><bold>Quality:</bold> User based quality is defined as &#x0201c;fitness for use&#x0201d;, which means the consumer's perception of quality.

Considerable number of clients (41%) were not able to read and write, while, 304 (72%) were married. Farmers account for 48.6% and 253 (60%) of the clients were from the rural areas. Out of the total respondents, 54.7% were revisiting and 91.0% came because of illnesses. 344 (81.5 %) were clients themselves and the rest were close family members and others. Nearly three fifth of the clients (57.8%) received the services free of charge. Concerning the ethnic composition of the clients, 306 (72.9) of them were Oromo, and 273 (64.7%) were followers of Islam (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1"

This level of satisfaction is also higher when compared to studies conducted in the hospitals of the Amhara region which showed satisfaction level of 22.0% to 50% (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Likewise, a report from Tigray zonal hospitals revealed satisfaction level of 43.60% (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The difference might be attributed to the fact that this study was conducted in a specialized teaching hospital where there are relatively adequate number of health professionals and better diagnostic facilities. In addition, study time and design might have also contributed. The present study was facility based and that of Gondar was a community based. Thus, this study should be interpreted with caution as it may tend to exaggerate social desirability bias and subjected to Hawthorne effect (courtesy bias).</p><p>The study has revealed that lack of drugs and supplies in the hospital pharmacies was the major problem, where about 70% of the clients with prescription paper for drugs did not get some or all of the ordered drugs from the Hospital's Pharmacy. This finding is similar with that of the study conducted in Jimma hospital earlier, where 63.7% of the clients lacked drugs from the hospital's pharmacies. It is also a comparable finding with that of study in Tigray Zonal hospitals which reported about 61% of those clients with prescription paper for drugs did not get the ordered drugs from the hospital pharmacies (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, our finding is higher than that of the study conducted in the hospitals of the Amhara region where about 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the clients did not get the prescribed drugs (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Failure to obtain the prescribed drugs from the hospital's pharmacy is in line with a report from a study conducted in Manica, Mozambique where it was found to be the most complaint associated with lower satisfaction (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Another study conducted in South Africa also revealed that access to drugs was one of the most suggested priorities for improvement of public health services (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>As it has been indicated in the resulted, dissatisfaction because of lack of drugs in the Hospital's pharmacies was statistically significant with payment status (p=0.000), Where about 39% of the clients from urban areas and about 47% of the paying clients were dissatisfied because of it. Many studies have also indicated that patients equate availability of drugs with high quality services (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Twenty percent of the clients in the present study were dissatisfied with the provision of information about the hospital services and their health problems. This is quite a low dissatisfaction rate when compared to the study conducted in Tigray zonal hospitals with 46.7% dissatisfaction rate (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The reason for the big difference could be due to the difference in the number and type of health care providers in those mentioned service delivery places and the variety of activities they run in their respective areas.</p><p>A study conducted in South Africa revealed lack of communication and relevant messages to patients were identified as an important issue impacting on quality thus affecting client satisfaction (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Highest satisfaction rate (82.7%) in this study may be attributed the way the doctor examined the clients. This high result could be expected in the study area hospital as it is a teaching center so that health professionals at different level are expected to demonstrate the standard way of patient examination. In contrary the lack of respect and courtesy were among the major reasons for dissatisfaction in Gondar study (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>In a study conducted in South Africa, the comments made about the poor quality of the relationships with the practitioner included: lack of empathy, mistreatment, lack of respect and lack of communication (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>As to this study, 37.2% of the clients were dissatisfied by the overall waiting time to get the services. This is higher than the finding reported earlier in Jimma hospital which showed 20.4% of the clients have reported long waiting time (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This higher dissatisfaction rate with waiting time could be attributed to the increased number of clients. However, the dissatisfaction rate with waiting time to receive the services in the study area is lower compared to the waiting time in the study in Tigray Zonal hospitals where 43.2% dissatisfaction rate was reported (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>This better finding could partially be due to the ongoing changes in the study area hospital because of the newly introduced reform, where an improvement in the service delivery process and staff attitudinal change might have resulted. Analysis of overall satisfaction by sociodemographic characteristics showed that educational status, and age were associated with satisfaction, where respondents who are illiterate, and the older age group were more satisfied as compared to those who have tertiary education (diploma and above) and the younger age groups respectively. This is in agreement with the study in Jimma Hospital in which satisfaction score was directly related to the age but had an in inverse relation to educational status, high education associated with low satisfaction score. It is also similar with a study conducted in Trinidad and Tobago which showed the percentage of satisfied clients decreased with increased educational status, but increased with increasing age (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The reason could be due to high expectation by those who are more educated than the illiterate (could be true for those who came from rural and for farmers) and confidence in medical care system and satisfaction in life in general by the older age groups.</p><p>In conclusion, the hospital management needs to understand the extent of the problem with drugs and supplies and plan to look for different mechanisms to keep adequate stock of essential drugs and supplies, fulfill human resource and standard medical equipment, establish an information desk at a convenient corner of the hospitals which would particularly be helpful for the majority of the clients who are illiterates, and avoid long waiting time and lack of privacy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to the student research project of Jimma University for its support.
