<bold>Abstract.</bold> Decades of research in causal and contingency learning
show that people&#x02019;s estimations of the degree of contingency between two
events are easily biased by the relative probabilities of those two events. If
two events co-occur frequently, then people tend to overestimate the strength of
the contingency between them. Traditionally, these biases have been explained in
terms of relatively simple single-process models of learning and reasoning.
However, more recently some authors have found that these biases do not appear
in all dependent variables and have proposed dual-process models to explain
these dissociations between variables. In the present paper we review the
evidence for dissociations supporting dual-process models and we point out
important shortcomings of this literature. Some dissociations seem to be
difficult to replicate or poorly generalizable and others can be attributed to
methodological artifacts. Overall, we conclude that support for dual-process
models of biased contingency detection is scarce and inconclusive.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>associative models</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>cognitive biases</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>contingency learning</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>cue-density bias</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>dual-process models</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>illusory correlations</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>outcome-density bias</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>propositional models</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Contingency learning is the ability to detect that different events in the
environment are statistically related. Classical and instrumental conditioning are
probably the simplest and more popular examples of contingency learning. However,
this ability is also an essential part of more sophisticated cognitive processes
like language acquisition (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1">Ellis,
2008</xref>), visual search (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1">Chun

(<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1">Kruschke, 2008</xref>). Given the
importance of these processes, it is hardly surprising that people tend to be very
good at detecting statistical correlations and causal relations since their first
years of life (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1">Beckers, Vandorpe,

1996</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, we are so eager to detect statistical patterns that we also tend to
perceive them when they are absent (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1">Chapman &#x00026; Chapman 1969</xref>; <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1">Matute, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-1">Redelmeier
&#x00026; Tversky, 1996</xref>). Understanding how and why we misperceive
contingency between unrelated events has become one of the most interesting topics
of research in cognitive psychology (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1">Gilovich, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="c97" ref-type="bibr" id="cr97-1">Vyse,
1997</xref>). It has been suggested that biased contingency detection might play
a role in the development of pseudoscientific thinking, clinical errors, social
stereotyping, and pathological behavior, among others (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1">Hamilton &#x00026; Gifford, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1">Lilienfeld, Ritschel, Lynn, Cautin, &#x00026; Latzman,

basic research on the mechanisms underlying these biases can make a potential
contribution to the improvement of debiasing and educational strategies aimed at
counteracting them (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1">Barber&#x000ed;a,
Blanco, Cubillas, &#x00026; Matute, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1">Matute et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the present review, we focus on two specific biases that are assumed to distort
our perception of contingency, namely, the cue-density bias and the outcome-density
bias (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1">Allan &#x00026; Jenkins, 1983</xref>;
<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1">L&#x000f3;pez, Cobos, Ca&#x000f1;o,

following sections we briefly explain these two biases and their contribution to our
understanding of why we perceive illusory correlations and why we infer causal
relations between events that are actually independent. Although biases in
contingency detection have been explored extensively for decades, there is still
little consensus about their underlying mechanisms. Traditionally, they have been
explained in terms of relatively simple single-process models that put the stress on
basic learning and memory processes (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1">Fiedler, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-2">L&#x000f3;pez
et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-1">Shanks,
1995</xref>). However, more recent theories have suggested that multiple
processes are needed to fully understand biases in contingency detection (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1">Allan, Siegel, &#x00026; Hannah, 2007</xref>;
<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1">Allan, Siegel, &#x00026; Tangen,

well with the increasing popularity of dual-process models in cognitive psychology
(<xref rid="c80" ref-type="bibr" id="cr80-1">Sherman, Gawronski, &#x00026; Trope,
2014</xref>).</p><p>The goal of the present paper is to assess critically the evidence for dual-process
models of biased contingency learning. To summarize our review, we first present the
basic methodology used to explore biases in contingency detection and the main
(single- and dual-process) theories designed to explain them. Then, we present the
results of a reanalysis of our own published work that suggests that the findings
that support dual-process models were not replicated in our own data set, comprising
data from 848 participants. In addition, computer simulations show that the use of
insensitive dependent measures might explain some results that are typically
interpreted in terms of dual-process models. Finally, we explore the experiments
that have tested the predictions of dual-process models with implicit measures and
we argue that the pattern of results is too heterogeneous to draw any firm
conclusions. In light of this, we conclude that for the moment it would be premature
to abandon traditional, single-process models. Unless future research shows
otherwise, these models still provide the best and simplest framework to understand
biases in contingency detection and to design successful debiasing strategies.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Biased Contingency Detection and Illusory Correlations</title><p>Imagine that you were asked to evaluate whether a new medicine produces an allergic
reaction as a side effect. To accomplish this task, you are shown the individual
medical records of a number of patients where you can find out whether each patient
took the medicine and whether he/she suffered an allergic reaction. How should you
assess the relation between taking the medicine and suffering the allergy? As shown
in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-1" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, to make this
judgment you would need four pieces of information that can be summarized in a
2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2 contingency table. You would need to know how many
patients took the medicine and suffered an allergy (cell <italic>a</italic>), how
many patients took the medicine and did not suffer an allergy (cell
<italic>b</italic>), how many patients did not take the medicine but suffered an
allergy nevertheless (cell <italic>c</italic>), and, finally, how many patients did
not take the medicine and did not suffer an allergy (cell <italic>d</italic>).</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Panel 1A represents a standard 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2 contingency
table. Panels 1B&#x02013;1G represent examples of contingency tables yielding
different &#x00394;<italic>p</italic> values.</title></caption><graphic id="fig1a" xlink:href="zea_63_1_3_fig1a"/></fig><p>Based on this information, you could compute some measure of contingency and estimate
whether or not that level of contingency is substantially different from zero.
Although there are alternative ways to measure contingency, the
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic> rule is usually considered a valid normative index
(<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1">Allan, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1">Cheng &#x00026; Novick, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1">Jenkins &#x00026; Ward, 1965</xref>).
According to this rule, if you want to assess the degree of contingency between a
cue (e.g., taking a medicine) and an outcome (e.g., an allergy), then you need to
compute<disp-formula id="eq1"><graphic xlink:href="zea_63_1_3_eq1a.jpg" id="eq1a" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>p</italic>(o|c) is the probability of the outcome given
the cue and <italic>p</italic>(o|~c) is the probability of the outcome in the
absence of the cue. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-2" rid="fig1">Figure
1A</xref>, these two probabilities can be easily computed from the information
contained in a contingency table. Positive values of &#x00394;<italic>p</italic>
indicate that the probability of the outcome is higher when the cue is present than
when it is absent (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-3" rid="fig1">Figure
1B</xref>). In contrast, negative values indicate that the probability of the
outcome is reduced when the cue is present (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-4" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, if the probability of the outcome is the
same in the presence as in the absence of the cue, the value of
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic> is always 0 (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-5" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In these latter cases, there is no contingency
between cue and outcome.</p><p>When laypeople are asked to estimate the contingency between two events, do their
judgments agree with this normative rule? As we will see, the answer is both
&#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;no.&#x0201d; To study how people detect contingency,
researchers typically rely on a very simple task that has become a standard
procedure in contingency-learning research. During the task, participants are
exposed to a series of trials in which a cue and an outcome may be either present or
absent, and they are instructed to discover the relationship between both. As in our
previous example, the cue can be a fictitious medicine taken by some patients and
the outcome can be an allergic reaction. On each trial, participants are first shown
information about whether a patient took the drug on a specific day and they are
asked to predict whether or not they think that this patient will develop an
allergic reaction. After entering a yes/no response, they receive feedback and they
proceed to the next trial. Once they have seen the whole sequence of trials in
random order, the participants are asked to rate their perceived strength of the
relationship between the medicine and the allergic reaction.</p><p>The usual result is that participants&#x02019; judgments tend to covary with the
objective drug-allergy contingency as measured by &#x00394;<italic>p</italic> (e.g.,
<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-3">L&#x000f3;pez et al., 1998</xref>;
<xref rid="c77" ref-type="bibr" id="cr77-1">Shanks &#x00026; Dickinson, 1987</xref>;
<xref rid="c98" ref-type="bibr" id="cr98-1">Wasserman, 1990</xref>). Therefore,
to some extent participants seem to be able to track the actual cue-outcome
contingency. However, departures from the objective contingency are also observed.
For instance, participants&#x02019; judgments tend to be biased by the marginal
probability of the outcome, defined as the proportion of trials in which the outcome
is present, that is,
<italic>p</italic>(outcome)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;(<italic>a</italic>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>c</italic>)/(<italic>a</italic>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>b</italic>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>c</italic>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>d</italic>).
<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-6" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> depicts an example
where there is no contingency between cue and outcome, but the outcome tends to
appear very frequently. In situations like this, participants tend to overestimate
contingency (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-2">Allan &#x00026; Jenkins,
1983</xref>; <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-2">Allan et al.,

Blanco, &#x00026; Matute, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c100" ref-type="bibr" id="cr100-2">Wasserman et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, other things being equal,
participants&#x02019; judgments tend to covary with the marginal probability of the
cue, defined as the proportion of trials in which the cue is present; that is,
<italic>p</italic>(cue)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;(<italic>a</italic>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>b</italic>)/(<italic>a</italic>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>b</italic>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>c</italic>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>d</italic>).
<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-7" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> represents an
example where the probability of the cue is high, but there is no contingency
between cue and outcome. Again, participants tend to overestimate contingency in
situations like this (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-3">Allan &#x00026; Jenkins,
1983</xref>; <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-2">Matute et al.,

&#x00026; Matute, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c100" ref-type="bibr" id="cr100-3">Wasserman et al., 1996</xref>). The biasing effects of the probability of the
outcome and the probability of the cue are typically known as
<italic>outcome-</italic> and <italic>cue-density biases</italic>. As the astute
reader might guess, the most problematic situation is that in which both the
probability of the outcome and the probability of the cue are large (<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-8" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Participants seem to
find particularly difficult to detect the lack of contingency in these cases (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1">Blanco, Matute, &#x00026; Vadillo,
2013</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that biases akin to these have also been found in the
social psychology literature on illusory correlations in stereotype formation (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-2">Hamilton &#x00026; Gifford, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1">Kutzner &#x00026; Fiedler, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1">Murphy, Schmeer, Vall&#x000e9;e-Tourangeau,
Mondrag&#x000f3;n, &#x00026; Hilton, 2011</xref>). In these experiments, participants
are shown information about the personality traits of members of two social groups.
Across trials, participants see more information about one of the groups than about
the other and they also see more people with positive traits than people with
negative traits. Most importantly, the proportion of positive and negative traits is
identical in both social groups. Therefore, there is no correlation between
membership to the majority or the minority group and the quality (positive vs.
negative) of personality traits. As can be seen, if one assumes that social groups
play the role of cues and that positive and negative traits play the role of
outcomes, this situation is identical to the one represented in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-9" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>. Although there is no correlation
between groups and traits, when participants are asked to rate the traits of both
groups, they systematically tend to judge the majority group more favorably than the
minority group. In other words, despite the absence of a real correlation,
participants tend to associate the majority group with the most frequent (positive)
personality traits and the minority group with the least frequent (negative)
personality traits. The interesting point, for our current purposes, is that we can
interpret illusory correlations as a combination of cue- and outcome-density biases,
which means that this effect may be explained as a contingency-learning
phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Single-Process Models of Cue- and Outcome-Density Biases</title><p>Traditionally, demonstrations of cue/outcome-density biases and illusory correlations
have been explained in terms of simple associative processes analogous to those
assumed to account for classical and instrumental conditioning (e.g., <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1">Alloy &#x00026; Abramson, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-5">L&#x000f3;pez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-2">Matute, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-2">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-2">Shanks, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="c81" ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-1">Sherman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c95" ref-type="bibr" id="cr95-1">Van Rooy, Van Overwalle, Vanhoomissen, Labiouse, &#x00026; French,
2003</xref>). The associative learning rule proposed by <xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-1">Rescorla and Wagner (1972)</xref> provides the simplest
example of this family of models. According to the Rescorla-Wagner model, when a cue
is followed by an outcome, an association or link is formed between the
representations of both stimuli. After each pairing, the strength of the association
is assumed to increase or decrease according to the formula:<disp-formula id="eq2"><graphic xlink:href="zea_63_1_3_eq2a.jpg" id="eq2a" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where &#x02206;<italic>V</italic><sub>C-O</sub> is the increase in the
strength of the cue-outcome association after that trial, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>
and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> are learning rate parameters depending on the salience
of the cue and the salience of the outcome, respectively, <italic>&#x003bb;</italic>
is a dummy variable coding whether the outcome was present or absent in that trial,
and V<sub>TOTAL</sub> is the sum of the associative strengths of all the potential
cues of the outcome present in that trial. In addition to the target cue, a
contextual cue is assumed to remain present in all trials. The association of the
contextual cue with the outcome is also updated according to Equation 2.</p><p>To illustrate how this simple model accounts for cue- and outcome-density biases, in
<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc2-1" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> we show the
predictions of the model when given as input the six contingencies depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-10" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-11" rid="fig1">1G</xref>. The top panel shows the
predictions of the model when the contingency is positive (1B), negative (1C), or
zero (1D). As can be seen, eventually the strength of the cue-outcome association
tends to converge to the true contingency, as defined by &#x00394;<italic>p</italic>.
By the end of training, the model learns a positive association when the cue-outcome
contingency is positive and a negative association when the cue-outcome contingency
is negative. When the cue-outcome contingency is exactly zero, the associative
strength of the cue also tends to move toward this value. Therefore, the model does
a good job at explaining why people are good at detecting contingencies (see <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1">Chapman &#x00026; Robbins, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1">Danks, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c99" ref-type="bibr" id="cr99-1">Wasserman, Elek, Chatlosh, &#x00026; Baker, 1993</xref>).
However, the model also predicts some systematic deviations from the true
contingency. In the four conditions where the contingency is zero, depicted in the
bottom panel, the model predicts an overestimation of contingency during the initial
stages of learning. These overestimations are larger when the outcome (1E) or the
cue (1F) is very frequent, and even larger when both of them are very frequent (1G).
Therefore, the model also provides a nice explanation for cue- and outcome-density
biases (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1">Matute, Vadillo, Blanco, &#x00026;

purposes, their most important feature is that, according to them, the same
mechanism explains (1) why people are sensitive to contingency and (2) why their
judgments are also biased under some conditions. A single process accounts for
accurate and biased contingency detection. As we will discuss below, this is the key
feature of single-process models that distinguishes them from their dual-process
counterparts.</p><p>It is interesting to note that this property is also shared by other early models of
biased contingency detection that do not rely on associative learning algorithms.
For example, instance-based models assume that each cue-outcome trial is stored in a
separate memory trace in long-term memory (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1">Fiedler, 1996</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-2">2000</xref>; <xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1">Meiser &#x00026; Hewstone,
2006</xref>; <xref rid="c84" ref-type="bibr" id="cr84-1">Smith, 1991</xref>).
Parts of these memory traces may be lost during the encoding process. In a situation
like the one represented in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-12" rid="fig1">Figure
1G</xref>, the loss of information has very little impact on the encoding of
cell <italic>a</italic> events, because there are many redundant memory traces
representing the same type of event. However, information loss can have a severe
impact on the encoding of cells&#x02019; <italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic>
events because there are fewer traces representing them. As a result, the
information encoded in memory contains more (or better) information about frequent
events (cells <italic>a</italic>) than about infrequent events (cells
<italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic>). Therefore, information loss explains
why participants tend to perceive a positive contingency whenever type
<italic>a</italic> events are more frequent than other events in the contingency
table. Most importantly, according to these models we do not need to invoke
different mechanisms to explain the cases in which participants are sensitive to the
actual contingency and the instances in which their judgments are biased. Accurate
and biased contingency detection are supposed to arise from the same operating
mechanisms. Therefore, from our point of view, instance-based theories also belong
to the category of single-process models.</p><p>For our present purposes, propositional models can be considered yet another case of
single-process models. In a thought-provoking series of papers, De Houwer and
colleagues (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1">De Houwer, 2009</xref>,
<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1">2014</xref>; <xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-2">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>) have suggested that all
instances of human contingency learning might depend exclusively on the formation
and truth evaluation of propositions. In contrast to simple associations,
propositions do not just represent that events in the environment are related to
each other: They also qualify how they are related (<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1">Lagnado, Waldmann, Hagmayer, &#x00026; Sloman, 2007</xref>).
For instance, &#x0201c;cholesterol is a cause of cardiovascular disease&#x0201d; and
&#x0201c;cholesterol is a predictor of cardiovascular disease&#x0201d; are different
propositions. However, the difference between them cannot be represented in terms of
a simple association. Although propositional models do not necessarily exclude the
contribution of associative processes (see <xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1">Moors, 2014</xref>), the representational power of propositions allows
these models to explain aspects of learning that fall beyond the scope of simple
associative models (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1">De Houwer, Beckers,
&#x00026; Glautier, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1">Gast

formalized in a mathematical model, but nothing in their current formulation
suggests that separate mechanisms would be needed to account for accurate and biased
contingency detection. For our present purposes, the idea that all learning depends
on the evaluation of propositions represents yet another example of a single-process
model.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Dissociations and Dual-Process Models</title><p>During the last decade, some researchers have abandoned these explanations in favor
of more complex dual-process theories (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-3">Allan et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-2">2007</xref>; <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-3">Perales et al.,
2005</xref>; <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-2">Ratliff &#x00026; Nosek,
2010</xref>). Although differing in the detail, the core idea of these proposals
is that they call upon one mechanism to explain how people (correctly) track
contingencies and a different mechanism to explain why their judgments are sometimes
biased by cue and outcome density. This proposal is based on the results of several
experiments showing what appear to be systematic dissociations between different
dependent measures.</p><p>Cue/outcome density biases and illusory correlations are typically assessed with a
numerical causal or contingency rating that participants provide at the end of the
experiment. As explained, these judgments show sensitivity to both actual
contingency and to the biasing effects of cue and outcome density. However,
according to these authors (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-4">Allan et al.,
2005</xref>, <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-3">2007</xref>; <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-4">Perales et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-3">Ratliff &#x00026; Nosek, 2010</xref>), other
dependent measures seem to be sensitive only to the actual contingency, showing no
trace of cue- or outcome-density biases. These alternative measures are assumed to
be relatively uninfluenced by higher-order reasoning processes, or at least, less
influenced by them than the numerical judgments typically used as dependent
variables. From this point of view, it follows naturally that there must be a very
basic learning mechanism that explains how people accurately track contingencies and
whose output can be directly observed in these dependent variables. In contrast,
judgments are affected both by contingency and by cue/outcome density biases.
Because measures that address directly the learning mechanism do not seem to be
sensitive to biases, these must be operating through a different mechanism that
influences judgments but not the original encoding of information. This is the
reason why these models incorporate different processes to account for accurate and
biased contingency detection. A schematic representation of the role of learning and
judgment processes of biased contingency detection is offered in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc3-1" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><fig id="fig3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of dual-process models of biased contingency
detection.</title></caption><graphic id="fig3a" xlink:href="zea_63_1_3_fig3a"/></fig><p>Therefore, in dual-process models two different and successively operating mechanisms
are invoked to explain why people are sensitive to contingency but they are also
biased by the marginal probabilities of the cue and the outcome. The first mechanism
would include basic encoding and retrieval processes that are highly sensitive to
the objective contingency. The information gathered by this mechanism would then
feed forward to other mechanisms involved in judgment and decision-making processes.
Biases would appear only at this latter stage.</p><p>These findings are certainly challenging for the theories of contingency detection
discussed in the previous section, which in the absence of additional assumptions
would typically anticipate similar effects in all dependent measures of contingency
learning. Note, however, that dissociations are not a perfect basis to draw
inferences about the presence of one or multiple systems. Borrowing an example from
<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1">Chater (2003)</xref>, following the
logic of dissociations one might conclude that human beings must have different
digestive systems, because some people are allergic to prawns, while others are
allergic to peanuts. Tiny differences in the way a single mechanism tackles similar
problems might create the illusion that several mechanisms are involved in an
operation that is actually best described in terms of a single-system process.</p><p>In spite of these concerns about the interpretation of dissociations, in the
following sections we do not question this logic, but the reliability of the
findings that support dual-process models of contingency learning. The evidence for
these models stems from three papers published during the last decade (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-5">Allan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-5">Perales et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-4">Ratliff &#x00026; Nosek, 2010</xref>).
Although their theoretical conclusions are quite consistent, the empirical findings
reported in each of them are noticeably different. In the following sections we
review each of them in turn and discuss their merits and shortcomings. To overview
our criticisms, we argue that some of these findings seem to be poorly replicable or
generalizable, while others are based on possibly faulty dependent measures.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cue- and Outcome-Density Biases in Trial-by-Trial Predictions</title><p>The first piece of evidence suggesting that these biases are not observed in all
dependent variables comes from an interesting experiment conducted by <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-6">Allan et al. (2005)</xref>. Two groups of
participants were instructed to discover the effect of a series of fictitious
chemicals (playing the role of the cue) on the survival of a sample of bacteria in a
petri dish (playing the role of the outcome). In each trial, participants saw
whether or not the chemical was present in a sample and they were asked to predict
whether or not the bacteria would survive. Immediately after entering their
responses, they were informed of the outcome of the trial (i.e., whether the
bacteria survived) and they proceeded to the next trial. At the end of training,
participants were asked to rate to what extent the chemicals had a positive or a
negative impact on the survival of bacteria, using a numerical scale from
&#x02212;100 (negative impact) to 100 (positive impact). The overall
chemical-survival contingency was different for each group of participants. For one
of them, the contingency was moderately positive
(&#x00394;<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.467), while for the other one the
contingency was always null (&#x00394;<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.000). Each
participant was asked to complete three of these contingency-detection problems, all
of them with the same overall contingency, but with different probabilities of the
outcome. Therefore, the experiment relies on a 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3 factorial
design with contingency as a between-groups manipulation and probability of the
outcome as a within-participant factor.</p><p>As the reader might expect, the first finding of <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-7">Allan et al. (2005)</xref> was that the numerical ratings that
participants provided at the end of each problem were influenced both by contingency
and outcome-probability. That is to say, participants were able, in general, to
track the objective degree of contingency between each of the chemicals and the
survival of bacteria; however, their ratings were also biased by the probability of
the outcome. This is a replication of the well-known outcome-density bias discussed
in previous sections.</p><p>Most interestingly, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-8">Allan et al.
(2005)</xref> found that other dependent measures seemed to be unaffected by
outcome density, although they were sensitive to the overall cue-outcome
contingency. Specifically, Allan et al. used the discrete yes/no predictions made by
participants in every trial to compute an alternative measure of their sensitivity
to contingency. If the participant believes that there is a statistical connection
between the chemicals and the survival of bacteria, then he or she should predict
the survival (i.e., respond &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to the question of whether the
bacteria would survive in the current trial) more frequently when the chemicals are
present than when they are not. Following this reasoning, it would be possible to
measure the extent to which a participant believes that there is a relationship
between the cue and the outcome using the formula:<disp-formula id="eq3"><graphic xlink:href="zea_63_1_3_eq3a.jpg" id="eq3a" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>
</p><p>Note that this index is based on the same logic that underlies the computation of
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic> in Equation 1, only that the real occurrence of the
outcome is replaced by the outcome predictions made by the participant (see <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1">Collins &#x00026; Shanks, 2002</xref>).
Therefore, &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> does not measure the objective
contingency between cue and outcome, but it aims at measuring the subjective
contingency that the participant perceives, as revealed by the trial-by-trial
predictions made during training.</p><p>When using &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> as their dependent variable,
<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-9">Allan et al. (2005)</xref> found that
this measure was sensitive to cue-outcome contingency. However, it was absolutely
unaffected by manipulations of the probability of the outcome. This result led them
to conclude that there must be a stage of processing in which the contingency
between cue and outcome or the target conditional probabilities have already been
encoded but the outcome-density bias is still absent. Then,
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> would provide an insight into this
basic mechanism that encodes contingency in a format that is not yet influenced by
the outcome-density bias. Given that the numerical judgments are influenced by both
contingency and outcome-probability, this must mean that judgments are affected not
only by the original encoding of information (sensitive to contingency but free from
bias) but also by processes that take place after encoding (see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc3-2" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In other words, the outcome-density
bias is not due to learning or encoding, but to more sophisticated processes related
to judgment and decision making. Although <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-10">Allan et al. (2005)</xref> explored only the outcome-density bias, they
suggested that a similar approach might explain the complementary cue-density bias
as well.</p><p>The results of <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-11">Allan et al. (2005)</xref>
and their interpretation are certainly appealing. If they proved to be reliable,
they would pose insurmountable problems for single-process models that aim to
explain cue- and outcome-density biases as learning effects. But, how strong is this
evidence? To answer this question, we decided to reanalyze data from our own
laboratory using the strategy followed by Allan et al. Specifically, we reanalyzed
data from nine experimental conditions exploring the cue-density bias (originally
published in <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-2">Blanco et al., 2013</xref>;
<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-3">Matute et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c94" ref-type="bibr" id="cr94-2">Vadillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c101" ref-type="bibr" id="cr101-1">Yarritu &#x00026; Matute, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c102" ref-type="bibr" id="cr102-1">Yarritu, Matute, &#x00026; Vadillo,
2014</xref>) and three experimental conditions exploring the outcome-density
bias (originally published in <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-2">Musca et
al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c93" ref-type="bibr" id="cr93-1">Vadillo, Miller,
&#x00026; Matute, 2005</xref>). All these experiments were conducted using the
standard experimental paradigm outlined above. In the original reports of those
experiments we only analyzed the judgments that participants reported at the end of
the training phase. However, we also collected trial-by-trial predictive responses
to maintain participants&#x02019; attention and to make sure that they were following
the experiment. These responses can be used to compute the
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> index using Equation 3. This allows us
to compare the size of the bias observed in the
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> scores with the size of the bias that
we observed in judgments. On the basis of the results of Allan et al., one should
expect a dissociation between these two measures. More specifically, cue- and
outcome-density biases should have an effect on judgments, but not on
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub>.</p><p>In the following analyses, we included data from 848 participants tested in 12
conditions included in the articles mentioned in the previous paragraph.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref><xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-1" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> plots the effect size (Cohen&#x02019;s
<italic>d</italic>) of density biases on the
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> index against the effect size of the
same manipulation on judgments collected at the end of the experiment. As can be
seen, overall, most experiments found clear evidence for density biases in
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub>. A random-effects meta-analysis
yielded a statistically significant effect of size
<italic>d</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.49, 95% CI [0.08, 0.90],
<italic>z</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.37, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.018.
Therefore, overall our results do not replicate the original findings of <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-12">Allan et al. (2005)</xref>: Cue and outcome
density do have an effect on &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> scores.
However, the confidence intervals plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-2" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> show that the effect of density bias did not reach
statistical significance in some experimental conditions. In two cases, the effect
was even negative. A closer look at the data shows that in the rare occasions when
biases were not observed in &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub>, they also
tended to be absent or smaller than usual in judgments. A meta-regression confirmed
that the effect size of biases on &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> was
moderated by the effect size of biases on judgments,
<italic>Q</italic>(1)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5.54, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.019.
These analyses suggest that cue- and outcome-density biases can be observed in
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> and that, when they are absent, it is
not due to a dissociation between judgments and
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub>, but to any other factor that affects
both measures.</p><fig id="fig4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Scatterplot of effect sizes (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>) of the

significantly correlated, <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.27,
<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001, and this correlation remained

respectively. Overall the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-4" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and these additional analyses are inconsistent with the
hypothesis that trial-by-trial predictions are unbiased by the probability of the
cue/outcome or that radically different results are observed with judgments and
trial-by-trial predictions. Thus, there is no need to postulate different mechanisms
to account for judgments and for trial-by-trial predictions.</p><p>This being said, <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-5" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also
reveals that some of our studies failed to find a significant effect of the
cue/outcome density manipulation on &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub>. To
some extent, this feature of our results can be considered a replication of <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-13">Allan et al. (2005)</xref>. But as seen in
<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc4-6" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and in the previous
analyses, this can hardly be considered strong evidence for a dissociation between
judgments and &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub>. The fact that sometimes
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> fails to yield significant results may
be due to its reduced reliability compared to judgments. There are many situations
where the use of unreliable or insensitive measures can produce patterns of results
that look like dissociations but do not require a dual-process account (<xref rid="c78" ref-type="bibr" id="cr78-1">Shanks &#x00026; St. John, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr" id="cr90-1">Vadillo, Konstantinidis, &#x00026; Shanks,

&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> might be an imperfect index of
contingency learning, as we discuss in subsequent sections.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Signal Detection Theory Analyses of Trial-by-Trial Predictions</title><p>
<xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-6">Perales et al. (2005, Experiment
1)</xref> found a dissociation strikingly similar to the one reported by <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-14">Allan et al. (2005)</xref>. In the study of
Perales et al., two groups of participants were exposed to several
contingency-learning problems where they had to learn the relationship between the
activation of a fictitious minefield and the explosion of enemy tanks. In each
trial, participants were first presented with information about whether the
minefield was active and were asked to predict by means of a yes/no response whether
or not they thought that the tanks would explode in that trial. After entering their
predictions, they were given feedback and they proceeded to the next trial. For one
of the groups, the contingency between the minefield and the explosions was always
positive, &#x00394;<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.50, while the contingency was
always zero for all the problems presented to the other group of participants.
Within participants, the probability of the cue was manipulated with two levels,
high (.75) and low (.25). At the end of each problem, participants were asked to
rate the strength of the causal relation between the activation of the minefield and
the explosion of tanks. Consistent with previous reports, Perales et al. found that
these numerical judgments were sensitive not only to the contingency manipulation,
but also to the cue-density manipulation. That is to say, for a specific level of
contingency, judgments tended to vary with the probability of the cue, replicating
the well-known cue-density bias. However, as in the case of Allan et al., Perales et
al. found that other dependent measures, also computed from participants&#x02019;
trial-by-trial responses, were sensitive only to contingency and were largely immune
to the cue-density bias.</p><p>Unlike <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-15">Allan et al. (2005)</xref>, <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-7">Perales et al. (2005, Experiment 1)</xref>
did not convert trial-by-trial predictions to
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> but, instead, they computed two
alternative measures inspired in Signal Detection Theory (SDT) analyses. One of
them, the criterion for responding, was a measure of participants&#x02019; overall
tendency to predict that the outcome will occur. The second one,
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032;, was the discriminability index of SDT analyses and aimed
at measuring participants&#x02019; ability to discriminate when the outcome was more
likely to appear and when it was less likely to appear. For reasons that will become
obvious later, only this second measure is relevant for the present discussion. To
compute the <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; index, Perales et al. registered the
&#x0201c;hit rate&#x0201d; of each participant (i.e., the proportion of trials in
which they correctly predicted that the outcome would occur, among all trials where
the outcome was present) and their &#x0201c;false alarm rate&#x0201d; (i.e., the
proportion of trials in which they incorrectly predicted the outcome, among all
trials where the outcome was absent). Based on these two measures,
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; can be easily computed as<disp-formula id="eq4"><graphic xlink:href="zea_63_1_3_eq4a.jpg" id="eq4a" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>z</italic> is the inverse of the normal cumulative
density function. Crucially, this equation ignores completely whether participants
made their predictions on cue-present or on cue-absent trials. The only important
thing is whether they correctly predicted the outcome when it was going to happen
and whether they incorrectly predicted the outcome when it was not going to happen.
In other words, the <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; index measures to what extent
participants are good at discriminating when the outcome will be presented and when
it will not. The rationale for using this index as a measure of participants&#x02019;
sensitivity to contingency is that, in principle, if participants have learned the
correct cue-outcome contingency, they should be able to make more accurate
predictions, and this should yield a higher <italic>d</italic>&#x02032;.</p><p>The key finding of <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-8">Perales et al.
(2005</xref>, Experiment 1) was that participants&#x02019;
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; scores turned out to be sensitive just to the contingency
manipulation, but not to the cue-density manipulation. This parallels <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-16">Allan et al.&#x02019;s (2005)</xref> finding
that &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> was affected by manipulations of
contingency, but not by manipulations of the probability of the outcome. Taken
collectively, both experiments converged on the same idea: There are some dependent
measures that reflect that participants have learned the cue-outcome contingency,
but which nevertheless show no trace of cue- or outcome-density bias. This stands in
stark contrast with the patterns of results found in numerical judgments, which are
sensitive to both contingency and density biases.</p><p>Perales et al. discussed several dual-process accounts that could explain these
dissociations. Although differing in the detail, all of them dovetailed with the
idea that there is a basic encoding mechanism that tracks cue-outcome contingency in
a format free from any cue- or outcome-density bias. The <italic>d</italic>&#x02032;
index would be a direct measure of this unbiased learning process. The density
biases observed in judgments must then be attributed to other mechanisms that
intervene in later stages of processing. This account fits well with the general
framework outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc3-3" rid="fig3">Figure
3</xref>.</p><p>However, a closer inspection of the results reported by <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-9">Perales et al. (2005</xref>, Experiment 1) suggests that
alternative interpretations are possible. A first striking feature of the results is
that the manipulation of the probability of the cue did in fact seem to have an
effect on <italic>d</italic>&#x02032;, although this effect was only marginally
significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.09,
<italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.067). The
authors argued that this effect was &#x0201c;far too small to account for the
significant effect of cause-density [i.e., cue-density] on judgments.&#x0201d; (p.
1109). However, this argumentation is only valid if one assumes that the validity,
reliability, and sensitivity of <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; as a dependent measure
are comparable to those of judgments. If <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; turned out to be
less sensitive, then the smaller effect size of the cue-density effect found of
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; would be very poor evidence for a dissociation.</p><p>Are there any reasons to suspect that <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; is not a sensitive
measure for cue- or outcome-density biases? We think so. The problems of
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; as a measure of learning are particularly obvious in
the two null-contingency conditions of <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-10">Perales et al. (2005</xref>, Experiment 1). In those conditions, the
probability of the outcome was always .50, no matter whether the cue was present or
not. In this situation, there was nothing participants could do to predict the
outcome successfully. The outcome and its absence were equally likely and the cue
did not offer any information to make the outcome more predictable. Furthermore,
this was the case in both the high cue-density and the low cue-density conditions:
The probability of the cue was higher in one condition than in the other, but this
did not change the fact that the outcome was equally unpredictable in both
conditions. Therefore, it is not surprising that participants in both conditions got
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; values indistinguishable from zero. Note that this
does not mean that participants had the same perception of contingency in those two
conditions. It only means that in those particular conditions, nothing participants
learn can help them make better outcome predictions as measured by
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032;. But crucially, if all participants produce a
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; of zero regardless of their predictions, then their
score cannot be used as a measure of their perception of contingency.</p><p>A computer simulation provides a simple means to illustrate the problems of
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; as a measure of contingency learning. In the
following simulation we computed <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; for a large number of
simulated participants exposed to the same contingencies used in <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-11">Perales et al. (2005, Experiment
1)</xref>. The labels PC-HD, PC-LD, NC-HD, and NC-LD shown in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-1" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> refer to the four
experimental conditions tested by Perales et al. These labels denote whether
contingency was positive (PC) or null (NC) and whether the density of the cue was
high (HD) or low (LD). For each experimental condition, we computed how many correct
and incorrect responses a simulated participant would get. Then, we used this
information to compute the <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; of that simulated participant
using Equation 4.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2"><sup>2</sup></xref>

Experiment 1)</xref>.</title></caption><graphic id="fig5a" xlink:href="zea_63_1_3_fig5a"/></fig><p>For each condition, we simulated 1,000 participants with nine different response
distributions. The rationale for simulating a wide variety of response strategies is
that, if <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; is a valid measure of learning, this index
should adopt different values when participants behave differently. Imagine that one
participant learns that there is positive contingency between the cue and the
outcome. This participant should say &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; very frequently when asked
whether the outcome will follow the cue and he/she should say &#x0201c;no&#x0201d;
very frequently when asked whether the outcome will appear in a trial in which the
cue was absent. Now imagine a second participant who learns that there is no
contingency between cue and outcome. This participant will be just as likely to
predict the outcome in cue-present and in cue-absent trials. If
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; is a good measure of contingency learning, these two
participants should get different <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; scores. In contrast, if
participants who act on the basis of different beliefs about the cue-outcome
contingency obtain the same <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; score, this would imply that
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; is not a valid measure of contingency detection. To
minimize the impact of sampling error on the exact number of hits and false alarms,
we run 1,000 simulations for each combination of experimental condition and response
distribution.</p><p>Each of the nine series of data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-2" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> refers to a different response distribution (e.g., 25/75,
50/50, &#x02026;). The first number (25, 50, or 75) refers to the probability of
predicting the outcome in the presence of the cue and the second number (also 25,
50, or 75) refers to the probability of predicting the outcome in the absence of the
cue. For instance, a simulated participant with response strategy 75/25 would
predict the outcome with probability .75 if the cue was present and with probability
.25 if the cue was absent (which is consistent with the belief in a positive
contingency). Similarly, a simulated participant with response strategy 75/75 would
predict the outcome with probability .75 regardless of whether the cue is present or
absent (which is consistent with the belief in a null contingency).</p><p>Consistent with our previous discussion, <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-3" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows that all simulated participants got almost identical
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; scores in the null-contingency conditions (right-most
half of the figure). In other words, the <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; scores obtained
by those participants reveal absolutely nothing about their pattern of performance.
In these null-contingency conditions, a participant who acted as if there were a
positive cue-outcome contingency (e.g., 75/25) would receive virtually the same
score as a participant who acted as if contingency were negative (e.g., 25/75).
Similarly, a participant who was very prone to predicting the outcome (e.g., 75/75)
and a participant who was very reluctant to predict the outcome (e.g., 25/25) would
obtain similar <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; scores. These predictions do not differ
across conditions with different cue-densities. This confirms our suspicion that the
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; scores obtained by <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-12">Perales et al. (2005, Experiment 1)</xref> in the NC conditions tell
us nothing about the participants performance&#x02019;, let alone about their beliefs
regarding the cue-outcome contingency or their outcome expectancies.</p><p>In contrast, the left-hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-4" rid="fig5">Figure
5</xref> shows that <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; can be a sensitive measure of the
perception of contingency in the positive contingency (PC) conditions tested by
Perales et al. In these conditions, different patterns of responding do give rise to
different <italic>d</italic>&#x02032; scores, suggesting that
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; can reveal something about participants&#x02019; beliefs
or about their response strategies. Therefore, it is only in these conditions with
positive contingencies that one can expect to measure differences in performance
with <italic>d</italic>&#x02032;. It is interesting to note that visual inspection of
the data reported by <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-13">Perales et al.
(2005)</xref> confirms that the trend towards a cue-density bias was stronger in
the PC condition than in the NC condition. When one takes into account that one half
of the experiment (the two NC conditions) is affected by a methodological artifact,
it becomes less surprising that the cue-density manipulation only had a marginally
significant effect on <italic>d</italic>&#x02032;.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Different Processes or Different Strategies?</title><p>This being said, we note that in the PC conditions the cue-density effect observed in
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; still looks relatively small, compared to the large
effect found in participants&#x02019; judgments. Going back to the reanalysis of our
own studies presented in our previous section, we also found there that, in some
occasions, cue/outcome density manipulations seemed to have a stronger effect on
judgments than on &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub>. Based on this evidence,
it appears that, in general, all the dependent measures computed from trial-by-trial
predictions (either &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> or
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032;) are less sensitive than numerical judgments. Is there
any reason why these dependent measures should be less reliable? As we will show
below, we suspect that the data reported by <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-17">Allan et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-14">Perales et al. (2005)</xref> provide an interesting insight into this
question.</p><p>Imagine that two participants, A and B, have been exposed to exactly the same
sequence of trials and that, as a result, they end up having the same beliefs about
the relationship between a cue and an outcome. For instance, imagine that both of
them have learned that the probability of the outcome given the cue is .75 and that
the probability of the outcome given the absence of the cue is .25. This means that
both of them would believe, implicitly or explicitly, that there is a moderate
positive contingency between cue and outcome (i.e., that the outcome is more likely
to appear in the presence of the cue than in its absence). Now, let us assume that
both participants are presented again with a series of trials where the cue is
present or absent and they are asked to predict whether or not the outcome will be
presented in each trial. Participant A might consider that, because the probability
of the outcome given the cue is .75, he should predict the outcome in roughly 75% of
the trials where the cue is present. And, similarly, because the probability of the
outcome given the absence of the cue is .25, he predicts the outcome in
approximately 25% of the trials where the cue is absent. The behavior of this
participant would show what researchers call &#x0201c;probability matching&#x0201d;
(<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-1">Nies, 1962</xref>; <xref rid="c79" ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-1">Shanks, Tunney, &#x00026; McCarthy,
2002</xref>; <xref rid="c87" ref-type="bibr" id="cr87-1">Tversky &#x00026; Edwards,
1966</xref>), that is, his predictions would match the probabilities seen (or
perceived) in the environment.</p><p>Now imagine that Participant B is asked to do the same task. But Participant B has a
different goal in mind: He wants to be right as many times as possible. If the
outcome appears 75% of the times when the cue is present, then predicting the
outcome on 75% of the trials is not a perfect strategy. If he did that, on average,
he would be right on 56.25% of the trials (i.e., .75&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;.75). In
contrast, if he always predicts the outcome when the cue is present, he will be
correct 75% of the times (i.e., 1.00&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;.75). If he wants to
maximize the number of correct outcome predictions, this is a much more rational
strategy. Following the same logic, if the probability of the outcome in the absence
of the cue is .25, it makes sense to always predict the absence of the outcome.
Doing that will allow him to be correct on 75% of the trials. Our point is that if a
participant wants to maximize the number of correct predictions, he will predict the
outcome whenever he thinks that its probability is higher than .50 and he will
predict the absence of the outcome in any other case. Not surprisingly, research
with human and nonhuman animals shows that maximization is a typical response
strategy in many situations (e.g., <xref rid="c88" ref-type="bibr" id="cr88-1">Unturbe &#x00026; Coromias, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, although both participants, A and B, base their responses on the same
&#x02018;beliefs&#x02019;, their behavior is radically different because they pursue
different goals. This has important implications for our review of the results
reported by <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-18">Allan et al. (2005)</xref>
and <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-15">Perales et al. (2005)</xref>. If
trial-by-trial predictions do not only depend on the perceived contingency but also
on response strategies like probability matching or maximization, then any dependent
variable computed from them (like &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> or
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032;) will be necessarily noisy and unreliable. This is
particularly problematic when many participants rely on a maximization strategy. For
instance, if we computed &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> for Participant A
in our previous example, that would yield an approximate value of .50, which
reflects quite well his beliefs about the contingency between cue and outcome.
However, if we computed &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> for Participant B,
this would yield a value of 1.00, which is a gross overestimation of his true
beliefs. These two participants would also receive different
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; scores.</p><p>In the case of <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-16">Perales et al.
(2005</xref>, Experiment 1), there is clear evidence of probability
maximization. The data reported in the Appendix of Perales et al. confirm that
participants in the PC group predicted the outcome in around 92&#x02013;93% of
cue-present trials and in 12&#x02013;13% of cue-absent trials. In the case of <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-19">Allan et al. (2005)</xref> there is no
obvious evidence for maximization in their noncontingent condition, but there
appears to be such a trend in the contingent condition. Their <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc5-5" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggests that although the actual
probability of the outcome given the cue varied from .567 to .900, participants
predicted the outcome in 70&#x02013;90% of cue-present trials. Similarly, although
the probability of the outcome in the absence of the cue ranged from .100 to .667,
participants predicted the outcome in 10&#x02013;30% of cue-absent trials. This
pattern is perhaps less extreme than the one found in <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-17">Perales et al. (2005)</xref>, but it does nevertheless
suggest that many of their participants must have used a maximization strategy. In
either case, this strategy makes &#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub> and
<italic>d</italic>&#x02032; less sensitive to any manipulation. The lack of
sensitivity might explain why they failed to find any effect of cue and outcome
density on these dependent variables.</p><p>It is interesting to note that participants are more likely to become
&#x0201c;maximizers&#x0201d; in relatively long experiments, which provide more
opportunities to develop optimal response strategies (<xref rid="c79" ref-type="bibr" id="cr79-2">Shanks et al., 2002</xref>). This might explain the
diverging results obtained by <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-20">Allan et
al. (2005)</xref> and <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-18">Perales et
al. (2005)</xref> and our own experiments. In their experiments, cue and outcome
density were manipulated within-participants. To accomplish this, all participants
had to complete the contingency learning several times. In contrast, in our
experiments all the manipulations were conducted between groups, reducing
substantially the length of the experiment and, consequently, the opportunities to
develop sophisticated response strategies like maximization.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Illusory Correlations in the Implicit Association Test</title><p>Dissociations between judgments and trial-by-trial predictions are not the only piece
of evidence in favor of dual-process models of biased contingency detection. This
approach received convergent support from a recent study by <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-5">Ratliff and Nosek (2010)</xref> that found a similar
dissociation between different measures of illusory correlations in stereotype
formation, suggesting that two or more processes might also be involved in this
effect.</p><p>As explained in previous sections, most experiments on illusory correlations in
stereotype formation rely on a fairly standard procedure (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-3">Hamilton &#x00026; Gifford, 1976</xref>). Participants are
presented with positive and negative traits of members of two different social
groups on a trial-by-trial basis. Crucially, there are more members of one group
(majority) than of the other (minority) and, regardless of group, most of the
members show positive traits. Although the proportion of positive and negative
traits is identical for the majority and the minority groups, people tend to make
more positive evaluations of the majority group when asked to judge both groups at
the end of training. Illusory correlations in stereotypes and cue/outcome density
biases have been explored in quite different literatures, but both effects are
clearly related and can be explained by the same or very similar models (<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-3">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c81" ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-2">Sherman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c95" ref-type="bibr" id="cr95-2">Van Rooy et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Illusory correlations are typically assessed by means of numerical ratings (similar
to judgments in contingency-detection experiments) or by asking participants to
recall which positive or negative traits were observed in the majority or the
minority group. However, <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-6">Ratliff and
Nosek (2010)</xref> wondered whether the same illusory-correlation effects would
be found in an alternative test that is supposed to provide a cleaner measure of the
underlying attitudes of participants: The Implicit Association Test (IAT; <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1">Greenwald, McGhee, &#x00026; Schwartz,
1998</xref>). Unlike traditional questionnaires, the IAT is a reaction-time test
that is traditionally assumed to measure implicit attitudes with little interference
from higher-order cognitive processes (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1">De Houwer, Teige-Mocigmba, Spruyt, &#x00026; Moors, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1">Gawronski, LeBel, &#x00026; Peters,
2007</xref>; <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-1">Nosek, Hawkins, &#x00026;
Frazier, 2011</xref>). Following this idea, if illusory correlations require the
operation of reasoning or inferential processes, then they should not be observed in
the IAT. In contrast, if only very elemental associative processes are responsible
for illusory correlations, then the IAT should be able to detect them.</p><p>
<xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-7">Ratliff and Nosek (2010)</xref> found
the standard illusory-correlation effect in the responses to the explicit
questionnaire. However, there was no hint of the effect in the IAT scores in any of
their two experiments. Most importantly, the absence of effects cannot be attributed
to the lack of validity of the IAT: The IAT was sensitive to the valence of the
majority and the minority groups when there was a correlation between membership to
one of them and the positive or negative personality traits. Nor can they be
attributed to a lack of statistical power, given that the results were replicated in
an online experiment with almost 900 participants.</p><p>
<xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-8">Ratliff and Nosek (2010)</xref>
interpreted these results in terms of a dual-process model (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1">Gawronski &#x00026; Bodenhausen, 2006</xref>) surprisingly
similar to that invoked by <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-21">Allan et al.
(2005)</xref> and <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-19">Perales et al.
(2005)</xref> in the domain of contingency learning. According to them, the IAT
would be only sensitive to the original encoding of associations in memory. From
this point of view, the fact that performance in the IAT was unaffected by the
illusory-correlation manipulation indicates that participants in their experiment
correctly learned that there was no correlation between belonging to one group or
the other and having positive or negative personality traits. Therefore, the
illusory-correlation effect observed in explicit judgments must have been due to
additional higher-order cognitive processes that took place on a later stage, and
not to the original learning mechanism responsible for the initial encoding of the
information (see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc3-4" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As in
the case of the results reported by Allan et al. and Perales et al., these results
pose problems for any single-process model that assumes that illusory correlations
are the product of the same mechanisms responsible for the detection of contingency.
If a single process were responsible for both sensitivity to contingency and for
density biases, why should an IAT be sensitive to one of these manipulations
(contingency) but not to the other (density)?</p><p>Before drawing any conclusion, it is convenient to review all the available evidence
regarding this dissociation. Until recently, the study conducted by <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-9">Ratliff and Nosek (2010)</xref> was the
only experimental work that had tried to detect illusory correlations with the IAT.
However, the latest attempt to replicate this result using a similar methodology has
failed to find any dissociation between explicit measures and the IAT. Using a very
similar procedure to Ratliff and Nosek, <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1">Carraro, Negri, Castelli, and Pastore (2014)</xref> did find an illusory
correlation on the IAT, showing that the original dissociation was either not
reliable or, more likely, not generalizable to similar but not identical conditions.
In a similar vein, a recent experiment conducted in our laboratory (<xref rid="c89" ref-type="bibr" id="cr89-1">Vadillo, De Houwer, De Schryver,
Ortega-Castro, &#x00026; Matute, 2013</xref>) found an outcome-density effect using
the IAT. The divergences with Ratliff and Nosek are less surprising in this case,
because Vadillo et al. used a radically different design and procedure. However,
this discrepancy converges to the idea that the failure of the IAT to detect
illusory correlations might not be a generalizable result.</p><p>To better illustrate the results found with the IAT, <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc6-1" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> depicts a forest plot with the divergent results of

their general discussion yielded results notably distant from those of their main
study, although both of them were statistically significant. This variability
suggests that whether or not illusory correlations are observed in the IAT probably
depends on a number of moderators that we still ignore. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc6-2" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the 95% confidence
interval of the random-effects model includes zero. An advocate of dual-process
models might claim that this null result of the meta-analysis supports the claim
that illusory correlations are not found in implicit measures like the IAT. However,
the confidence interval does not just include zero: It extends over a large number
of positive effect sizes. On the basis of the collective evidence, any value from
&#x02212;0.13 to a massive 1.16 could be an accurate estimate of the average
Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>. We doubt that this evidence is clear or robust
enough to abandon single-process models of illusory correlations, which offer a
simple and parsimonious explanation for a large body of data (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1">Allan, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-3">Fiedler, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-6">L&#x000f3;pez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-4">Shanks, 1995</xref>). Even more so, if we keep in mind that the only converging

and <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-20">Perales et al. (2005)</xref> is
open to criticism.</p><fig id="fig6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Forest plot of a meta-analysis exploring the results of the experiments

in cue- and outcome-density effects across dependent variables (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-23">Allan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-21">Perales et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-10">Ratliff &#x00026; Nosek, 2010</xref>). A
common result of these experiments is that there are some dependent measures that
only show sensitivity to contingency (e.g.,
&#x00394;<italic>p</italic><sub>pred</sub>, <italic>d</italic>&#x02032;, or IAT
scores), while other dependent measures (e.g., contingency judgments) show
sensitivity to both contingency and cue/outcome density. On the basis of this
evidence, it has been suggested that two separate mechanisms are needed to explain
(1) why people are able to learn the correct cue-outcome contingencies and (2) why
their judgments are influenced not only by contingency but also by the overall
probabilities of the cue and the outcome. However, on closer inspection, it appears
that this evidence might not be reliable enough to justify this theoretical
interpretation. A review of the available evidence from our laboratory and from
other research groups shows that some of these results do not seem to be replicable
or do not generalize easily to similar experimental settings. In our experiments,
cue- and outcome-density manipulations seem to have a significant impact on all
dependent measures. Similarly, our simulations show that some of the dissociations
previously reported in the literature might be due to simple methodological
artifacts resulting from aspects of the design and the computation of the dependent
variable.</p><p>Given the lack of strong evidence in favor of these dual-process accounts, we think
that it is premature to abandon the idea that sensitivity to contingency and density
biases are both attributable to the operation of a single mechanism. As mentioned in
the Introduction, this idea is an essential feature of many associative models that
were originally invoked to account for cue- and outcome-density effects (<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-7">L&#x000f3;pez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr" id="cr75-5">Shanks, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="c81" ref-type="bibr" id="cr81-3">Sherman et al., 2009</xref>). It is also a central feature
of alternative models of biased contingency detection, such as instance-based models
(<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-2">Fiedler, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-2">Meiser &#x00026; Hewstone, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c84" ref-type="bibr" id="cr84-2">Smith, 1991</xref>). Beyond the specific
details of these models, their common feature is that they all share the assumption
that the same mechanism that is responsible for detecting and encoding the
relationship between cues and outcomes is also responsible for density biases. In
other words, there is no level of representation in the cognitive system where
contingency information is represented in a format that is free from cue- or
outcome-density biases.</p><p>Note that, although we favor single-process models of biased contingency detection,
we do not ignore the fact that different processes might contribute to each of the
dependent variables used in this kind of research. We do not question the idea that
there are manipulations that might affect one dependent variable without affecting
others. In fact, part of our own research has been directed at showing that
judgments of contingency can vary considerably depending on seemingly minor
procedural details like the wording of the test question (<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1">Matute, Vegas, &#x00026; De Marez, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c92" ref-type="bibr" id="cr92-1">Vadillo &#x00026; Matute, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c93" ref-type="bibr" id="cr93-2">Vadillo et al., 2005</xref>; see also
<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1">Crocker, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1">De Houwer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-1">Perales &#x00026; Shanks, 2008</xref>).
Moreover, part of our discussion of <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-22">Perales et al. (2005)</xref> relies on the idea that participants sometimes
adopt response strategies that might mask their true perception of contingency. What
we are suggesting here is that there are no strong reasons to assume that there are
two different levels of representation of contingency information, one that closely
mirrors objective contingencies and one where that information is biased by factors
like the probability of the cue or the probability of the outcome. In the absence of
stronger evidence, it appears more parsimonious to assume that a single
representation is learned during contingency-learning experiments and that this
representation is biased by cue and outcome density at the encoding level.</p><p>Dual-process models of biased contingency detection share some ideas with other
dichotomist models of cognition (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1">Evans
&#x00026; Over, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1">Kahneman,
2011</xref>; <xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr" id="cr65-1">Osman, 2004</xref>;
<xref rid="c82" ref-type="bibr" id="cr82-1">Sloman, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="c86" ref-type="bibr" id="cr86-1">Stanovich &#x00026; West, 2000</xref>). There
is a crucial difference, though, between the dual models reviewed in this article
and other dual-process models. Traditionally, dual models have tended to explain
biases and cognitive illusions attributing them to very simple cognitive mechanisms
that operate effortlessly and in a relatively automatic manner, usually related to
simple encoding or retrieval processes. More complex cognitive mechanisms, usually
strategic processes related to judgment and decision making, have been invoked to
explain why people are sometimes able to overcome the harmful effect of these biases
and intuitive reactions (e.g., <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-2">Kahneman,
2011</xref>). Interestingly, the dual-process models of biased contingency
detection that we review here make the opposite interpretation: Correct contingency
detection is attributed to the operation of basic encoding and retrieval processes,
while biased judgments are attributed to more sophisticated judgment and
decision-making processes. We might even say that these models present a benign view
of biases in contingency detection: Although people might show a bias in their
judgments, deep inside their cognitive system there is some level of representation
where information is represented accurately (a similar perspective can be found in
<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1">De Neys, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The question of whether biases in contingency detection are due to basic encoding and
retrieval processes or whether they reflect the operation of judgment and
decision-making processes is not only important from a theoretical point of view. As
mentioned above, it has been suggested that these biases might contribute to the
development of superstitious and pseudoscientific thinking (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-2">Gilovich, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1">Lindeman &#x00026; Svedholm, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-4">Matute et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-2">2015</xref>; <xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-2">Redelmeier &#x00026; Tversky, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="c97" ref-type="bibr" id="cr97-2">Vyse, 1997</xref>). Given the societal costs of these and other
biases, cognitive psychologists have started to develop a number of interventions
and guidelines for protecting people from cognitive biases (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-2">Barber&#x000ed;a et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1">Lewandowsky, Ecker, Seifer, Schwarz, &#x00026; Cook,
2012</xref>; <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1">Lilienfeld, Ammirati,
&#x00026; Landfield, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr" id="cr74-1">Schmaltz &#x00026; Lilienfeld, 2014</xref>). Interventions designed to reduce
biases can only be successful to the extent that they are based on an accurate view
of their underlying mechanisms. If the underlying information was somehow encoded in
a bias-free format, as suggested by dual-process models of contingency learning,
these beliefs should be relatively easy to modify. Teaching people how to use more
rationally the information and intuitions they already have should suffice to
overcome these biases. This prediction stands in stark contrast with the well-known
fact that superstitions are difficult to modify or eradicate (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1">Arkes, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-2">Lilienfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-1">Nyhan, Reifler, Richey, &#x00026; Freed, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr" id="cr68-1">Pronin, Gilovich, &#x00026; Ross, 2004</xref>;
<xref rid="c83" ref-type="bibr" id="cr83-1">Smith &#x00026; Slack, 2015</xref>). We
think that the persisting effect of biases is more consistent with the view that
these beliefs are hardwired in the way people encode information about the
relationship between events, as suggested by single-process models. Based on the
evidence we have discussed so far, it seems safe to suggest that attempts to debias
superstitions and misperceptions of contingency should include teaching people to
look for unbiased information.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors were supported by Grant PSI2011-26965 from Direcci&#x000f3;n General de

due to their design requirements, trial-by-trial predictions were only requested

the &#x0201c;high probability of the cue&#x0201d; condition if they belonged to
the one third of the sample with the highest probability of the cue. As
mentioned above, we also included in our analyses three experimental conditions
exploring the outcome-density bias. One of them originally reported by <xref rid="c93" ref-type="bibr" id="cr93-3">Vadillo et al. (2005</xref>,

outcome-density was observed for prediction judgments, but this cannot be
