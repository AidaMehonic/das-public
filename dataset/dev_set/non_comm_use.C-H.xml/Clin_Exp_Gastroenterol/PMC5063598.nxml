It causes inflammation of the lining of digestive tract, which can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition. It is characterized by the formation of strictures, fistulas, ulcers, and granulomas in the mucosa. It may affect people in early childhood until late adulthood and has a significant impact on patient&#x02019;s quality of life due to an increased prevalence of comorbidities.<xref rid="b1-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although the gastrointestinal manifestation of CD can primarily affect the terminal ileum and colon, it can also compromise any region from the mouth to the rectum of the affected patients. The clinical manifestations of CD can include diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, malnutrition, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Extraintestinal findings, for instance, arthropathy or skin disorders, can also occur and have a substantial impact on the patient&#x02019;s quality of life.<xref rid="b2-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>A recent study from Tayside (in Scotland) indicates a prevalence rate of 157/100,000, meaning there are &#x0003e;115,000 people in the UK with CD at the present time.<xref rid="b3-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The causes of CD are widely debated. Smoking, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors are considered as important factors that are likely to play a role.<xref rid="b3-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>CD is a progressive disease with long-term damage to intestinal mucosa (if not controlled properly) and recurrent attacks, with acute exacerbations interspersed with periods of remission or less active disease.<xref rid="b3-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Treatment is largely directed at managing flares and inducing/maintaining remission, rather than curing, and active treatment of acute disease (inducing remission) should be distinguished from preventing relapse (maintaining remission).<xref rid="b3-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Management options for CD include nutritional therapy, smoking cessation, drug therapy, and, in severe or chronic active disease, surgery.<xref rid="b3-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The aims of drug treatment are to reduce symptoms and maintain or improve quality of life, while minimizing toxicity related to drugs over both the short and long term. Glucocorticosteroids (ie budesonide) are recommended to be the first-line pharmaceutical for CD<xref rid="b5-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>; 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for CD patients in whom glucocorticosteroid treatment is contraindicated.<xref rid="b3-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> For moderately active CD, azathioprine (AZA)/6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or methotrexate in combination with steroids is a treatment option recommended by the European Crohn&#x02019;s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Both National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and ECCO recommend biological therapies (eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; inhibitors and integrin blocker) as an alternative for patients with objective evidence of active disease, who have previously been steroid-refractory, -dependent, or -intolerant.<xref rid="b5-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors (eg infliximab) and/or immunomodulators are used as add-on treatments to glucocorticosteroids in case of severe and active CD when disease has not responded to conventional therapy or the glucocorticosteroid dose cannot be tapered.<xref rid="b3-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In recent years, there have been other drugs with other mechanisms of action under development, for example, humanized monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, janus kinase inhibitors, and integrin inhibitors (eg, vedolizumab).<xref rid="b6-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>A number of clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the pharmaceutical treatments in CD. Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses of these clinical trials were conducted to understand the clinical effectiveness and safety of drugs used in treating CD. A meta-analysis including 12 clinical trials suggested that budesonide was no more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission; however, the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to sparse data and high risk of bias (single-blind and no allocation concealment).<xref rid="b10-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Another meta-analysis including 27 studies showed that anti-TNF-&#x003b1; antibodies were superior to placebo in inducing remission of luminal CD. Anti-TNF-&#x003b1; antibodies were also superior to placebo in preventing relapse of luminal CD.<xref rid="b11-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In a systematic literature review including 13 randomized clinical trials with a total of 1,211 participants, it was concluded that immunosuppressive drugs, such as AZA and 6-MP, are no more effective than placebo for inducing remission in CD.<xref rid="b12-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there has been no published systematic literature review to investigate how these pharmaceutical therapies are adopted in real-world clinical practice and whether the results from the clinical trials can be generalized to real-world settings.</p><p>The objective of this work is to systematically review the treatment pattern of pharmaceutical inventions in CD in real-world clinical practice (in Europe) and the clinical effectiveness and safety of the pharmaceutical therapies that are labeled for the treatment of CD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A systematic literature review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines on March 26, 2015, to identify relevant publications regarding current treatment pattern in practice, clinical effectiveness and safety of pharmaceutical therapies in real-life settings, patient preference in CD, and resource utilization/costs of treating CD. Among the aforementioned topics, current treatment pattern in practice and clinical effectiveness/safety of pharmaceutical therapies in real-life settings are the issues of interest for this study. A study protocol was developed to ensure the replicability of this literature review. The study protocol specified databases, limitations, and inclusion and exclusion criteria to be used in selection.</p><p>We searched Medline<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Embase<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and Cochrane (including Health Technology Assessment Database and National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database) to identify articles published from 2000 onwards.

Full-text papers were accessed for all publications that were qualified in the title/abstract selection phase according to the same inclusion and exclusion criteria. In order to be able to target recent publications and have a geographic focus of the European countries, a further time limitation from year 2010 and a geographic limitation of Europe, or major European Union countries including UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Portugal were used during the full-text selection phase.

After removing duplicates and screening the titles and abstracts of these 1,998 articles, 755 articles were retrieved and reviewed for full text. Based on the full-text publications, 705 articles were excluded for reasons according to the study protocol, including ineligible population (n=125); not interventions of interest, for example, surgical intervention and off-label drugs (n=169); not real-world studies (n=17); and irrelevant outcomes (n=123). Furthermore, 166 articles were excluded as they are either published before 2010 or conducted in countries other than those of interest.

There are two general approaches adopted by the studies to define clinical remission/response. The first approach is to define clinical response according to symptoms control in a steroid-free setting, measured by either some standard tools (ie, CDAI [remission defined as CDAI &#x0003c;150], or Harvey&#x02013;Bradshaw Index [HBI; remission defined as HBI &#x0003c;4]), judgment of a physician, or need for surgery.

Although there are limited number of studies that investigated the use of pharmaceutical therapies in CD, these studies suggested a similar pattern in Europe. 5-ASA and corticosteroids have been widely used among CD patients, although there has been a trend of decreasing prescription in recent years. No studies investigating the clinical effectiveness and safety of 5-ASA and corticosteroids in the real-world setting has been identified, showing a lack of interest of researchers and/or physicians in this topic.</p><p>Immunomodulators and biological therapies appear to be promising treatment options in CD management and have been increasingly used in Europe in recent years, especially as long-term maintenance treatments.<xref rid="b28-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Due to the variance in how clinical effectiveness is measured across the studies, the results are not directly comparable. Nevertheless, clinical effectiveness is mainly measured by symptom-based measurements, for example, remission rate, response rate, CDAI, HBI. Based on the results reported by the identified studies, infliximab, adalimumab, and thiopurines are likely to achieve a remission rate of ~50% as maintenance therapies. Dose escalation was observed among approximately one-third and half of the CD patients receiving infliximab and adalimumab treatments, respectively, within 5&#x02013;7 months. However, a substantial recurrence/relapse rate (18% per patient-year<xref rid="b36-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and cumulatively up to 83%<xref rid="b28-ceg-9-311" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) was also reported among patients who were under immunomodulator or biological treatments, and especially among those who discontinued the treatments.</p><p>Few major safety issues have been reported regarding these immunomodulators and biological therapies besides those that are widely recognized with these agents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Bas van Dijk (employed by Pharmerit) for editing the manuscript.
