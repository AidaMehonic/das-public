Spasmolytic polypeptide/trefoil factor 2&#x02013;expressing metaplasia (SPEM) is known to emerge after parietal cell loss and during <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection, however, its role in gastric ulcer repair is unknown. Therefore, we sought to investigate if SPEM plays a role in epithelial regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Acetic acid ulcers were induced in young (2&#x02013;3 mo) and aged (18&#x02013;24 mo) C57BL/6 mice to determine the quality of ulcer repair with advancing age. Yellow chameleon 3.0 mice were used to generate yellow fluorescent protein&#x02013;expressing organoids for transplantation. Yellow fluorescent protein&#x02013;positive&#x000a0;gastric organoids were transplanted into the submucosa and lumen of the stomach immediately after ulcer induction. Gastric tissue was collected and analyzed to determine the engraftment of organoid-derived cells within the regenerating epithelium.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Wound healing in young mice coincided with the emergence of SPEM within the ulcerated region, a response that was absent in the aged stomach. Although aged mice showed less metaplasia surrounding the ulcerated tissue, organoid-transplanted aged mice showed regenerated gastric glands containing organoid-derived cells. Organoid transplantation in the aged mice led to the emergence of SPEM and gastric regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data show the development of SPEM during gastric repair in response to injury that is absent in the aged stomach.

These changes include decreased gastric acid secretion, motility, and proliferation.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In addition, angiogenesis, a fundamental process essential for wound healing, is impaired with advanced age.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Such pathophysiological changes are believed to result in disrupted repair in response to chronic ulceration in the elderly that can be exacerbated during chronic insults such as <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In elderly patients there is a strong association between ulceration with cancer or evolution of dysplasia into neoplasia.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Renewal of gastric stem cells to produce committed progenitor cells that differentiate further into adult epithelial cell types is important for the structural integrity of the mucosa. However, relatively little is known regarding the age-related changes affecting gastric epithelial stem cells.

Recent investigations have indicated that loss of parietal cells, either from acute toxic injury or chronic <italic>Helicobacter</italic> infection, leads to the development of spasmolytic polypeptide/trefoil factor (TFF) 2&#x02013;expressing metaplasia (SPEM) through transdifferentiation of chief cells into mucous cell metaplasia.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the face of continued inflammation and M2-macrophage influence, SPEM may progress to a more proliferative preneoplastic metaplasia.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> However, studies with acute injury have indicated that SPEM disappears after resolution of injury.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Whether SPEM may contribute to the healing of gastric ulcers is unknown. We now report that SPEM represents a major reparative lineage responsible for wound healing after gastric ulcer injury.

Briefly, the stomach was opened along the greater curvature and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A dissecting microscope was used to remove the muscle layer. The remaining tissue was cut into pieces smaller than 5 mm<sup>2</sup> and incubated in 5 mmol/L EDTA in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) (without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) for 2 hours on a shaker at 4&#x000b0;C. For gastric gland dissociation 5 mL of dissociation buffer (55 mmol/L D-sorbitol and 43 mmol/L sucrose in DPBS without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) was added to tissue and vigorously shaken for 2 minutes. Media containing glands was centrifuged at 65&#x000a0;&#x000d7; g for 5 minutes. Glands were resuspended in Matrigel Corning Incorporated (Tewksbury, MA) and 50 &#x003bc;L of glands suspended in Matrigel was added to each well. Gastric organoid media containing 50% Wnt conditioned media, 10% R-spondin conditioned media, [Leu15]-gastrin 1 (10 nmol/L; Tocris, Pittsburgh, PA), N-acetylcysteine (1 mmol/L; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), fibroblast growth factor 10 (100 ng/mL; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), epidermal growth factor (50 ng/mL; PeproTech), Noggin (100 ng/mL; PeproTech), Y-27632 (10 &#x003bc;mol/L; Sigma), and advanced Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)/F12 was added after Matrigel polymerization at 37&#x000b0;C.

Patients were aged between 15 and 19 years. Human fundus was collected during sleeve gastrectomies (Institutional Review Board protocol number: 2013-2251). The human gastric tissue was cut into pieces smaller than 5 mm<sup>2</sup> before being suspended in advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 20 mmol/L HEPES and 2 mmol/L Glutamax (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A total of 1 mg/mL collagenase (C9891; Sigma) and 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin were added to the supplemented advanced DMEM/F12 media.

The stomach was exteriorized through a midline abdominal laparotomy opening. One hundred percent acetic acid was applied to the serosal surface of the exteriorized stomach for 25 seconds using a capillary tube. Organoids were transplanted at the same injury site. Before transplantation, organoids were washed twice with ice-cold DPBS (without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) to remove Matrigel. Organoids then were resuspended in DPBS to a concentration of approximately 500 organoids per 50 &#x003bc;L. Immediately after ulcer induction either 50 &#x003bc;L DPBS or 50 &#x003bc;L organoids were injected into the muscle and submucosa of the stomach surrounding the ulcer site using a 26G&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 3/8 syringe (309625; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). The stomach then was replaced into the abdominal cavity and the muscle and skin incisions were sutured.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Tissue was collected from the ulcerated area and fixed in Carnoy&#x02019;s fixative or 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 hours. Human gastric ulcer tissue array was purchased from US Biomax, Inc (Rockville, MD) (BB01011a). Longitudinal sections of the mouse stomach were paraffin-embedded and 4-&#x003bc;m sections were stained for histologic evaluation.

Twenty percent normal goat, donkey, or rabbit serum was used to block the sections. Sections then were immunostained with a primary antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody for 1 hour. The primary antibodies and dilutions used were as follows: 1:200 dilution of anti&#x02013;green fluorescent protein Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (A21311; Thermo Fisher), 1:10,000 mouse-specific rat anti-CD44v, 1:25,000 human-specific rat anti-CD44v (a gift from Professor Hideyuki Saya, Keio University), 1:1000 mouse anti&#x02013;hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase &#x003b2; (MA3-923; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), 1:100 rabbit anti-intrinsic factor (Ab91322; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), 1:100 rabbit anti&#x02013;chromagranin A (CgA) (Ab15160; Abcam), and rabbit antihistone (Ab125027; Abcam). Rabbit anti-TFF2 (mouse- and human-specific) was adsorbed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with 5 &#x003bc;g recombinant human TFF2 in a final volume of 5 &#x003bc;L and used at a 1:1000 dilution for immunostaining. Secondary antibodies used were diluted 1:100 anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 555, or 633, and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 633. Hoechst (10 mg/mL) was added after the secondary antibody in a 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature.

<italic>Helicobacter</italic> infection and parietal cell&#x02013;specific protonophores (DMP-777 and L635) are known inducers of SPEM.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Although an earlier study reported the emergence of TFF2 expression at the ulcer margin,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> we report the induction of SPEM after gastric ulceration. SPEM was identified in the ulcer margin in the regenerating gastric glands and disappeared when the mucosa returned to its normal compendium of cell lineages, suggesting a possible role for SPEM in ulcer repair. Emerging SPEM cells were localized to the base of the ulcer margin, similar to where the ulcer associated cell lineages have been described previously during repair in the intestine.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Our data suggest that SPEM may represent the major reparative lineage responsible for wound healing after severe gastric ulceration.</p><p>Although ulcers induced in aged mice led to aberrant repair, as evidenced by the formation of foveolar hyperplasia within the injured tissue, organoid transplantation restored normal glandular architecture in these mice. These&#x000a0;data are consistent with findings showing impaired angiogenesis, decreased prostaglandin biosynthesis, and delayed injury healing in the gastric mucosa of aging rats.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Here, we show that engraftment of cells through the transplantation of gastric organoids contributes to ulcer repair in aged mice. Previous studies have shown organoid engraftment and repair in the mouse intestine. Yui et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> have shown that organoids derived from a single Lgr5+ colon stem cell are transplantable, engrafting within a superficially damaged mouse colon. This organoid engraftment was shown to be beneficial to the recipient mice.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> In addition, Fordham et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> showed that after transplantation into a colonic injury model, in&#x000a0;vitro expanded fetal intestinal progenitors contribute to epithelial regeneration. Our study reports that mouse- and human-derived organoids are transplantable in gastric tissue and are beneficial for repair of ulcer damage. We are still in the preliminary stages of investigating the engraftment and differentiation of organoids transplanted into the gastric epithelium. However, taken together, these results indicate that transplantation of organoids may provide SPEM lineage cells that can promote repair in the aged stomach.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Salles</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is stomach spontaneously ageing?
