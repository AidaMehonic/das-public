In the published article, we reported that satisfaction with life <italic>negatively</italic> correlated with self-esteem, optimism, subjective well-being, gratitude, and positive emotions in the US. However, we note the correct finding as follows: satisfaction with life <italic>positively</italic> correlated with these factors in the US. In the published article, we reported in the correlation matrix that depression <italic>positively</italic> correlated with the aforementioned factors in the US. However, we correct the finding as follows: depression <italic>negatively</italic> correlated with these factors in the US.</p><p>To recap, in the published article, we reported four main findings, namely:</p><list list-type="order" id="list1-2055102917703260"><list-item><p>The bicultural group had higher scores on the measure of optimism both in the US and Japanese groups than in the other three cultural groups; this finding is corrected as follows: the bicultural group had higher scores on measure of <italic>optimism in the US only</italic> than the other three cultural groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The independent group had higher levels of self-esteem than the other three cultural groups both in the US and Japan; this finding is corrected as follows: the independent group had higher levels of <italic>subjective well-being, gratitude, and satisfaction with life</italic> than the other three cultural groups both in the US and Japan.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The interdependent group had higher scores on the undesirable factors of depression (in the US only), and also in pessimism, social anxiety, and negative emotion than the three other cultural groups both in the US and Japan; this finding is corrected as follows: the interdependent group had higher scores on the undesirable factors of <italic>depression and perceived stress in the US and Japan</italic> than the other three cultural groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The marginal group experienced high levels of negative emotions including depression (in the US only) and perceived stress than the other three cultural groups; this finding is corrected as follows: the marginal group experienced higher levels of <italic>social anxiety (in the US only)</italic> than the other three cultural groups.</p></list-item></list><p>These findings can be framed from the bicultural identity or biculturalism perspectives, which have been useful in explaining four self-construal types among the participants in mid-life in the US and Japan. Bicultural group members are both high in independence and high in interdependence in terms of self-construal. From our findings, the revamped conclusion about the direction is that people in this group tend to exhibit greater perceived positive health and well-being across divergent measures when compared to the other three self-construal groups.</p></body></article>
