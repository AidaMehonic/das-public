Surveillance cultures were performed weekly from: tracheal aspirates, urine, and gut (oropharynx &#x000b1; gastric aspirates). The pts were catalogued in two groups: colonized (appearance or persistence of <italic>Candida</italic> in surveillance cultures) and invasive candidiasis (IC) (defined as any one or more of the conditions following: candidemia, endophtalmitis, other infections: peritonitis, organ biopsy). Multisite colonization (MC) was defined as &#x02265; 2 sites positive from surveillance cultures, and persistent MC as positive cultures in &#x02265; 1 week. The pts were clasified in two groups, medical, and surgical-traumatic. Demographic variables, APACHE II, comorbidity, associated risk factors and outcome were analized and compared between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We analyzed 1765 consecutive pts: 961 were considered colonized or infected by <italic>Candida</italic> species: 468 were medical, 309 surgical and 184 traumatic pts. In the medical group 438 were colonized (persistent MC, 78 pts; non-persistent MC, 183 pts; and in a single site, 202 pts, and 30 (6.4%) were in IC group. <italic>C. albicans</italic> was the most prevalent (82.4%). Univariate analysis identified factors to be associated with <italic>Candida</italic> colonization/infection in the medical pts: age, APACHE II, diabetes, COPD, hematologic malignancies, renal insufficiency, immunosupression, steroid therapy time, and mortality rate (intra-ICU and hospital). By stepwise logistic regression, hematologic malignancies (OR 6.0 [95% CI, 1.1-31.4]), diabetes (OR 2.4 [95% CI, 1.4-4.2]), and enteral nutrition (OR 2.2 [95% CI, 1.4-3.6]), proved to predict the development of <italic>Candida</italic> presence in medical pts independently.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Hematologic malignancies, diabetes and enteral nutrition are independently significant risk factors for <italic>Candida</italic> colonization/infection in medical critically ill patients.</p></sec></body></article>
