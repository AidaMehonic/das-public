Here we make use of transcriptome and exome sequencing data from thousands of tumours across 19 cancer types, to identify lncRNAs that are induced or repressed in relation to somatic mutations in key oncogenic driver genes. Our screen confirms known coding and non-coding effectors and also associates many new lncRNAs to relevant pathways. The associations are often highly reproducible across cancer types, and while many lncRNAs are co-expressed with their protein-coding hosts or neighbours, some are intergenic and independent. We highlight lncRNAs with possible functions downstream of the tumour suppressor <italic>TP53</italic> and the master antioxidant transcription factor <italic>NFE2L2</italic>. Our study provides a comprehensive overview of lncRNA transcriptional alterations in relation to key driver mutational events in human cancers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>
Long non-coding RNAs are implicated in multiple aspects of tumourigenesis. Here, the authors generate a landscape of these macromolecules in a wide array of cancer types and examine which RNAs are transcriptionally altered in relation to somatic driver mutations in established coding cancer genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Transcriptomic studies have shown that mammalian genomes encode an abundance of messenger RNA(mRNA)-like transcripts that are often multiexonic and polyadenylated, but lack obvious protein-coding capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Increasingly, it is becoming clear that some of these long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important regulatory roles in cells, for example by controlling transcription through recruitment of histone-modifying complexes to chromatin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, regulation of mRNA translation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> or control of mRNA splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Several studies also implicate dysregulation of lncRNAs as a contributing factor in human cancer, with early examples such as <italic>MALAT1</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) now followed by many others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>Notably, an increasing number of studies describe lncRNAs that act as critical downstream effectors in established cancer-relevant pathways. Examples include the identification of <italic>lincRNA-p21</italic> as a key target and mediator of the p53 DNA damage response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, as well as other studies of p53-regulated long non-coding RNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Similarly, inhibition of Notch1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia identified lncRNAs acting as downstream targets and effectors of Notch signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and both overexpression and siRNA silencing of <italic>MYC,</italic> followed by transcriptomic profiling, has been used to identify long non-coding RNAs acting downstream of c-Myc (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Another recent study compared the transcriptomes of melanocytes with and without expression of mutant <italic>BRAF</italic>(V600E), revealing differential expression of several lncRNAs including <italic>BANCR</italic>, shown to affect melanoma cell migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>While intriguing, these studies are still limited in number, and it is likely that lncRNAs have roles also in many other oncogenic programs. An attractive prospect is therefore to harness the increasing availability of mutational and transcriptomic data from tumours, to identify associations between coding oncogenic drivers and potential effector lncRNAs in a more systematic way. Recently, this idea was briefly explored in lung cancer using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), revealing associations between the mutational status of six key oncogenes and altered expression of lncRNAs (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Although an obvious drawback to this approach is that it is correlative, that is, does not involve molecular perturbations, in return it has the potential to greatly facilitate the exploration of associations between lncRNAs and a large number of mutational driver events. Importantly, associations detected in this manner also represent direct observations from actual human tumours; a distinct advantage compared with data from cell culture systems. Still, the principle has not been systematically explored and evaluated in comprehensive human tumour materials.</p><p>Here we make use of molecular data generated by TCGA to determine expression levels and copy number amplitudes for GENCODE (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) lncRNAs in more than 7,000 tumours across 19 types of human cancer. We establish a methodology to systematically search for associations between established key driver mutations and alterations in the expression of individual lncRNAs. The approach is evaluated in several ways, including silencing of the antioxidant transcription factor <italic>NFE2L2</italic>, which plays a critical role in lung tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, followed by transcriptome profiling to confirm predicted <italic>NFE2L2</italic>-responsive lncRNAs. We present a catalogue of associations, involving a broad repertoire of driver events, that are often consistent across many cancer types and that may serve as a reference and starting point for experimental studies. Additionally, our study provides an overview of lncRNA expression in human cancers.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>LncRNA molecular profiles across 7,295 human tumours</title><p>We established a framework whereby poly(A)-positive transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and copy-number data from TCGA were used to derive lncRNAs expression and copy-number profiles across 7,295 human tumours. We additionally obtained coding mutation data for a subset of 4,698 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The cohort spanned 19 cancer types, although breast cancer (BRCA) samples were subdivided into the four established PAM50 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) subtypes for a total of 22 types, each represented by between 49 and 517 tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p>Briefly, expression levels were determined by realignment of RNA-seq libraries to the human genome and subsequent quantification of lncRNAs and coding genes in the GENCODE (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) annotation (Methods). We choose this lncRNA catalogue as it has been subjected to extensive manual curation and evaluation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. We considered 13,307 lncRNAs that were further subdivided into 7,885 &#x02018;genic' and 5,422 &#x02018;intergenic' loci, based on a 5&#x02009;kb threshold with respect to the distance to the nearest coding gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). LncRNAs are often expressed at low levels, and high sequencing depth is therefore essential for proper quantification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. We consequently included only RNA-seq libraries generated on the Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 platform that resulted in at least 25 million fragments mapping to GENCODE gene loci (average 54.8 million), in the end obtaining data from 7,295 samples that each represented a unique tumour and patient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Finally, lncRNAs and coding genes were assigned DNA copy number amplitudes by remapping of segmented data from the Affymetrix SNP6 platform, available for all 7,295 samples.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Overview of lncRNA expression in human cancer</title><p>We next sought to obtain an overview of the obtained lncRNA profiles, in part to ensure the overall technical validity. By comparison of the maximum length-normalized expression value (FPKM) across all samples we found that lncRNAs were expressed at considerably lower levels than coding genes in tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), in agreement with several earlier observations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Notably, only 439,000 fragments were on average mapped to lncRNA loci in each sample, further reduced to 171,000 for intergenic lncRNAs and to be compared with 52.8 million for coding genes, again stressing the need for high sequencing depth in lncRNA transcriptomic studies.</p><p>While lncRNAs in general are weakly expressed, some are highly abundant and exceed even many coding mRNAs (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). We found that a small number of loci contributed a major fraction of all intergenic lncRNA-derived reads, notably with the top five constituting more than 50&#x00025; in many cancers (for example, <italic>XIST</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) or <italic>HULC</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The total fraction lncRNA-derived reads varied between cancers (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1e-99, one-way ANOVA), to a large extent explained by abundant <italic>MALAT1</italic> or <italic>NEAT1</italic> in some types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This variability was largely mirrored in corresponding normal samples, and was not explained by <italic>MALAT1</italic>/<italic>NEAT1</italic> copy number gain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Notably, these lncRNAs are both processed by RNase P from a poly(A)-positive into a poly(A)-negative transcript<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, and a shift in the ratio between forms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> or, alternatively, increased detection of polyA-negative RNA in some of the cancers, could conceivably contribute to the observed variability. Among top expressed loci in all cancers was also <italic>LINC00657</italic>, previously shown to be conserved between human and mouse and highly expressed in endothelium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p>We next investigated genome-wide correlations between DNA copy number amplitudes and expression levels. While these were generally much lower for lncRNAs compared with coding genes, this was largely explained by the overall low abundance of lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), and correlations approached that of coding genes when considering only highly expressed loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The results support the overall validity of the data, as positive DNA-to-RNA correlations depend on proper lncRNA quantification.</p><p>Principal components analysis was applied to investigate whether cancer types were distinguishable based on their repertoires of expressed intergenic lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). We found that tumours from the same or related cancer types typically clustered closely together, supporting earlier results that many cancers have distinct lncRNA signatures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In the principal components analysis, glioblastoma and low-grade glioma samples were similar yet different from other cancers, suggesting a distinct lncRNA profile in neural tumours. Likewise, there was co-occurrence between breast (BRCA) and ovarian (OV) carcinomas, known to have several commonalities including copy number alterations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The results show that tumour types are clearly distinguishable by their lncRNA expression profiles, a likely reflection of the high degree of tissue specificity shown by many lncRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Associations between driver mutations and mRNA changes</title><p>We next explored the relationship between somatic driver mutations and transcriptional changes in tumours, with the ultimate goal of associating key mutational events with alterations in lncRNA expression. The principle has so far only seen limited use and the feasibility has not been evaluated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, and we therefore wanted to first assess and establish our methodology on the protein-coding transcriptome.</p><p>We defined a set of 68 key driver genes commonly mutated in cancer, all established cancer genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> and with significant recurrence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> in the present material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, Methods). We next used non-parametric statistics (two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test) to test for associations between mutations in these genes (exome data) and changes in mRNA levels, individually in each cancer type. As a first step, we applied an inclusive significance threshold (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 uncorrected) in combination with a minimum requirement on the expression level change (two-fold), which produced a large number of associations (22,613; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Although randomization of sample labels showed that most of the associations were statistically true (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), many may represent indirect effects, for example due to transcriptional subtypes that differ with respect to the frequency of important driver mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. This was suggested, for example, by a large number of <italic>TP53</italic>-related associations.</p><p>To circumvent this and enrich for more relevant signals, we hypothesized that <italic>bona fide</italic> downstream effectors, such as direct targets of cancer-relevant transcription factors, would be likely to show consistent alterations in multiple cancer types, in relation to a specific mutational event. We thus focused on 30 events for which 1,121 such consistent associations (replicated in &#x02265;2 cancers using the criteria above), involving 978 unique genes, were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). In comparison, randomized data produced only two consistent associations (corresponding to a false discovery rate&#x0003c;0.005; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The added requirement of cross-cancer replicability thus adds considerable stringency and removes most initial hits.</p><p>We first noted that several canonical direct targets were among the detected genes. These included the prototypical downstream effector and positive target of p53 <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (<italic>p21</italic>) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), which showed a strong negative association with mutations in <italic>TP53</italic>, which are typically inactivating, in multiple cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Similarly, among genes consistently associated with activating mutations in <italic>NFE2L2</italic>, a master regulator of the oxidative stress response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, were several well-known direct targets and downstream effectors including <italic>GCLC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and <italic>GCLM</italic>. Notably, all <italic>NFE2L2</italic> associations were positive, compatible with <italic>NFE2L2</italic> being a transcriptional activator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Importantly, by comparison with available microarray data from A549 lung cancer cells treated with siRNA against <italic>NFE2L2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) we found that most <italic>NFE2L2</italic>-associated mRNAs detected in &#x02265;2 cancers, and all detected in &#x02265;4 cancers, were repressed 24&#x02009;h post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p>By comparison with the molecular signatures database (MSigDB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, we found that gene sets consistently associated with specific driver genes in our analysis were in several cases enriched for relevant pathways or direct responders identified by chemical or molecular perturbation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). These included, for <italic>EGFR</italic>, genes repressed after treatment with the EGFR inhibitor CL-387785 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>) (<italic>q</italic>=1.4e-2); <italic>NFE2L2</italic>, genes repressed after siRNA silencing of <italic>NFE2L2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>) (<italic>q</italic>=1.9e-19); <italic>RB1</italic>, genes induced on shRNA silencing of <italic>RB1</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) (3.5e-11); <italic>KRAS</italic>, genes induced by <italic>NRAS</italic> overexpression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> (<italic>q</italic>=1e-2), as well as various ERK/MAPK-related sets; <italic>TP53</italic>, genes responding differentially to DNA damage in <italic>TP53</italic> null or wild type cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> (<italic>q</italic>=9.4e-7). While limited by available gene sets in molecular signatures database, these results further support that integration of mutation and expression data from thousands of tumours is useful to identify effector transcripts that show altered expression in relation to specific oncogenic mutational events. Importantly, while some associations may be indirect and more difficult to interpret, it appears that by considering signals replicated in multiple cancers we enrich for transcripts that are canonical downstream responders or direct targets.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>LncRNAs are altered in relation to key mutational events</title><p>Having established our methodology on the coding transcriptome, we next used the same principle to uncover associations between key mutational driver events and altered lncRNA expression (complete unfiltered result in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). We focus here on a subset of lncRNAs showing clear and consistent associations in multiple cancers, although additional relevant effects might be present at lower stringencies. Our analysis identified 189 consistent associations (replicated in &#x02265;2 cancers as established above for mRNAs) involving 21 mutational events and 169 unique lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>), while none were found using randomized data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>LncRNAs may be co-expressed with neighbouring or overlapping coding genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, suggesting that associations may arise secondary to mRNA expression changes. Hence, for each of the 189 associations we compared its strength (lowest <italic>P</italic>-value across cancers) to that of its closest up and downstream coding neighbours, as well as any coding gene within 100&#x02009;kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). We found that the genic lncRNAs, which constituted roughly half (98/189) of the associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), were typically hosted by coding genes that likewise were strongly associated with the same driver events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Expectedly, these lncRNAs-mRNA pairs were normally co-expressed (indicated by dot size in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). For example, two out of three genic lncRNAs associated here with mutations in <italic>CTNNB1</italic> (&#x003b2;-catenin) co-localize with <italic>NKD1</italic>, an established transcriptional target of &#x003b2;-catenin complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> and a marker of aberrant Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref> shows <italic>RP11-401P9.6</italic>, antisense intronic to <italic>NKD1</italic>). The intergenic associated lncRNAs (91/189) were generally more independent and showed less co-expression with nearby coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Interestingly, co-expressed coding neighbours would in many cases show weaker associations, compatible with lncRNAs being primary targets rather than the opposite.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Known and novel <italic>TP53</italic>-dependent lncRNAs</title><p>We note that, out of three intergenic lncRNAs highlighted in a recent study as being the strongest lncRNA responders to DNA damage and direct targets of p53 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), two were among the <italic>TP53</italic>-associated lncRNAs identified in our screen, in both cases due to consistent reduction in <italic>TP53</italic> mutated tumours (<italic>LINC01021</italic>, also known as <italic>LOC643401,</italic> and <italic>RP3-510D11.2</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). The third, <italic>LINC00086</italic> (also known as <italic>LED</italic>), as well as the recently identified p53 effector <italic>MKLN1-AS1</italic> (also known as <italic>PINT</italic>&#x02009;)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, showed similar patterns but did not meet our stringent criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). <italic>LINC01021</italic> was recently confirmed as a p53 target and a negative regulator of proliferation in SW480 colorectal cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. As some <italic>TP53</italic> mutations can have a gain-of-function effect in addition to disrupting normal <italic>TP53</italic> action<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, we additionally performed our association screen using this subset. This identified one intergenic lncRNAs, <italic>RP1-46F2.2</italic>, which was activated in relation to <italic>P53</italic> gain-of-function mutations independently from its coding neighbours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>By re-analysis of nuclear run-on data (GRO-seq) from HCT116 colon cancer cells treated with the p53-activating agent Nutlin-3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>), we found that lncRNAs negatively associated with <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in our screen typically showed reduced transcription in <italic>TP53</italic> null compared with wild type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), supporting the overall validity of the results. The strongest reduction (139-fold) was seen for <italic>RP11-115D19.1</italic>, which was 2.9-fold transcriptionally induced 1&#x02009;h after Nutlin-3 treatment in wild type cells while being almost completely blocked in <italic>TP53</italic> null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).

Instead, by focusing on effects that are replicated across cancer types, more informative results are obtained, often enriched for known downstream responder mRNAs. Applying this strategy to lncRNAs recapitulated known biology in relation to <italic>TP53</italic> and also provided numerous new predictions, some of which were further highlighted.

Here, we highlight lncRNAs consistently induced in tumours with activation of the transcription factor <italic>NFE2L2</italic> (encoding NRF2), which is critical for the oxidative stress response. We demonstrate by RNA-seq that predicted <italic>NFE2L2</italic>-dependent lncRNAs typically show immediate responsiveness to <italic>NFE2L2</italic> silencing in A549 cells, where NRF2 is constitutively active<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. Although some detected associations may be due to indirect effects, these results suggest that many represent immediate downstream consequences. In particular, for <italic>LINC00942</italic>, we confirmed that NRF2 directly binds to an upstream regulatory element in its promoter to induce its transcription. Additionally, transfection with ASOs complementary to <italic>LINC00942</italic> suggested a functional role in the <italic>NFE2L2</italic> antioxidant pathway by altering levels of GCLC, which is required for synthesis of the key antioxidant glutathione and a known target of NRF2. Compatible with a reduction in GCLC, reductions in glutathione levels and a marked increase in ROS were observed. However, additional mechanisms are likely involved and further work is needed to validate and extend these results. By using orthogonal methods such as CRISPR/Cas9 targeted mutagenesis and CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional repression/activation, future studies will be able to establish the function and mechanism of action for <italic>LINC00942</italic> or other lncRNAs downstream of <italic>NFE2L2</italic>.</p><p>In summary, we have systematically investigated alterations in lncRNA expression in relation to key mutational driver events in human cancers.

DNA of 250&#x02009;&#x003bc;l was added to each IP, as well as 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of DNA for the input sample. Immunoprecipitation of the NRF2 protein was done using a rabbit monoclonal antibody targeting the C-terminus of human NRF2 (Abcam, EP1808Y) and a rabbit polyclonal NRF2 antibody (Diagenode, C15410242). As a negative control, a rabbit IgG antibody was used (Diagenode, cat. no. C15410206). Three replicate immunoprecipitations was performed for each antibody in each cell line. The fragmented DNA was incubated with 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of each antibody conjugated to the magnetic beads overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Next, the un-bound antibodies were removed, followed by de-cross-linking of the formaldehyde fixed protein&#x02013;DNA complexes. The chromatin was eluted in both immunoprecipitated and input samples by incubating the samples at 65&#x02009;&#x000b0;C overnight. To purify the DNA, immunoprecipitated and input samples were incubated with IPure magnetic beads and then washed with 50&#x00025; isopropanol (VWR, cat. no. 437423R). The isolated DNA was used for qPCR analysis to test for enrichment of the predicted NRF2 binding site. Two positive controls (established NRF2 sites in <italic>HMOX1</italic> and <italic>NQO1</italic>) and three negative control regions lacking NRF2 binding sites were also considered. Primer sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Life technologies, cat. no.

A549 and H838 cells were cultured in a 12-well plate 24&#x02009;h prior to transfection, and at a confluency of approximately 80&#x00025; cells were transfected with the wild type or mutant plasmid together with one of two different control siRNAs or two siRNAs targeting <italic>NFE2L2</italic>.
