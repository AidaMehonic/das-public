Here we show that the COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) and the Wiskott&#x02013;Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue (WASH) complexes are both crucial for endosomal sorting of LDLR and for its function.

Furthermore, <italic>Commd1</italic> depletion results in mislocalization of LDLR, accompanied by decreased LDL uptake. Increased total plasma cholesterol levels are also seen in hepatic COMMD9-deficient mice.

This pentameric protein complex, which consists of WASH1, FAM21, strumpellin, KIAA1033 (also known as SWIP) and CCDC53, is recruited to endosomes by the retromer complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Retromer is formed by the vacuolar protein-sorting (VPS) proteins VPS26, VPS29 and VPS35, and in concert with sorting nexins, it selectively mediates endosomal cargo sorting into recycling and retrieval pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Recently, the COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex has been identified to interact and colocalize with retromer and the WASH complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The CCC complex consists of the copper metabolism MURR1 domain-containing (COMMD) proteins, coiled-coil domain-containing protein 22 (CCDC22), coiled-coil domain-containing protein 93 (CCDC93) and C16orf62 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Among the 10 COMMD proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, COMMD1, a gene product that is mutated in Bedlington terriers affected by a hepatic copper storage disorder resulting in copper toxicosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, was shown to regulate in concert with the WASH complex the recycling of the copper transporter ATP7A (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In this same study, we reported that X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) patients carrying a mutation in <italic>CCDC22</italic> (c.49A&#x0003e;p.T17A) also have aberrant copper homeostasis, as serum copper and serum ceruloplasmin levels are increased in these patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>Given the pleiotropic function of COMMD1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and CCDC22 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), and the large number of membrane proteins sorted by the WASH complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, it is expected that the CCC complex is involved with numerous physiological processes. Here we identify that the CCC complex regulates the level of circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by mediating the endosomal trafficking of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Mutations affecting the formation of the CCC complex cause hypercholesterolaemia in humans, dogs and mice. We further show that LDLR is an endosomal cargo of the CCC-associated WASH complex, and inactivation of this complex results also in LDLR mislocalization and impaired LDL uptake. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanism causing hypercholesterolaemia, and highlights the importance of CCC and WASH complexes in cholesterol homeostasis.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>CCDC22</italic> mutations are associated with hypercholesterolaemia</title><p>On further clinical analysis of a large XLID family affected with a <italic>CCDC22</italic> p.T17A mutation we discovered that these patients also have an increase in total plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), exceeding the 95th percentile corrected for age and gender<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. One of the patients (V-2, 4 years of age) is too young, and plasma cholesterol levels are not informative in this case<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In another XLID family with a <italic>CCDC22</italic> mutation (p.Y557C) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), we found that the circulating total cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol of the two patients carrying the mutation were also above the 95th percentile (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). These observations suggest that mutations in the CCC component <italic>CCDC22</italic> are causally related to hypercholesterolaemia.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>COMMD1 deficiency results in hypercholesterolaemia in dogs</title><p>Since <italic>CCDC22</italic> mutation (p.T17A) and COMMD1 inactivation both impairs the formation of a stable CCC complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, we were prompted to investigate the plasma cholesterol levels in dogs with a <italic>COMMD1</italic> loss-of-function mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In addition to the expected copper accumulation in the liver of these animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), the levels of the CCC components CCDC22 and CCDC93 were markedly reduced in liver homogenates from a COMMD1-deficient (<italic>COMMD1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>) dog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Importantly, similar to patients with <italic>CCDC22</italic> mutations, <italic>COMMD1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> dogs have elevated plasma TC levels, showing a &#x0223c;50&#x00025; increase in plasma cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) without affecting plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In unaffected littermates (<italic>COMMD1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> dogs), cholesterol is predominantly carried in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), due to the absence of cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity in dogs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In <italic>COMMD1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> dogs, the plasma cholesterol profile revealed that cholesterol is mainly present in the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p>High levels of copper in the liver have previously been described to be associated with reduced circulating cholesterol levels in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, we therefore evaluated a possible correlation between progressive hepatic copper accumulation and plasma cholesterol levels in dogs. As a model, we used Labrador retrievers affected by copper toxicosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). The aetiology of this disorder is unknown, but <italic>COMMD1</italic> has been excluded to be the causal gene. Plasma cholesterol levels and lipoprotein profile were unchanged in affected Labrador retrievers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c,d</xref>). These observations are in agreement with a recent study on Wilson disease, the main disorder of copper toxicosis in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Although Wilson disease patients accumulate copper to toxic levels in their livers, as COMMD1-deficient dogs, no unusual plasma cholesterol (total, HDL and LDL) levels were observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Altogether, these data suggest that aberrant copper homeostasis and elevated plasma cholesterol are not causally linked in dogs or humans, and thus the CCC-deficient phenotype is due to pleiotropic effects.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ablation of hepatic <italic>Commd1</italic> increases plasma LDL in mice</title><p>LDL is the foremost cholesterol type that is elevated in patients and dogs carrying mutations affecting the CCC complex, and since the liver is the main organ involved in clearing circulating LDL cholesterol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> we determined the cholesterol levels and the lipoprotein profiles of hepatocyte-specific <italic>Commd1</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Commd1</italic><sup>&#x00394;Hep</sup>) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) fed either a chow diet or a high-fat high-cholesterol (HFC, cholesterol 0.2&#x00025;) diet. Consistent with the increased plasma cholesterol concentrations found in COMMD1-deficient dogs, plasma cholesterol levels in <italic>Commd1</italic><sup>&#x00394;Hep</sup> mice were significantly higher than in <italic>Commd1</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup> wild-type (WT) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), with an increase of &#x0223c;35&#x00025; (chow-fed mice) and &#x0223c;39&#x00025; (HFC-fed mice). Plasma TG levels, hepatic cholesterol, hepatic TG concentrations and body weight were however unaffected by the loss of hepatic <italic>Commd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). As shown previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, hepatic copper concentrations were not affected in <italic>Commd1</italic><sup>&#x00394;Hep</sup> mice when dietary copper was not increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>), which further supports that the increase in plasma cholesterol by CCC insufficiency is not caused by aberrant copper homeostasis. These data are in agreement with the fact that patients with <italic>CCDC22</italic> mutations have increased serum ceruplasmin and copper levels, but do not exhibit clinical signs of copper overload or liver injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In addition, we observed no differences in cholesterol levels between WT mice and transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase in hepatocytes (Alb-Cre), thus excluding the possibility that Cre recombinase expression in murine liver affects cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p>Next, we determined the lipoprotein profiles of pooled plasma samples from WT and <italic>Commd1</italic><sup>&#x00394;Hep</sup> mice fed either conventional chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) or HFC diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Independent of the diet, hepatic <italic>Commd1</italic> ablation resulted in significantly higher LDL cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c&#x02013;f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b,c,d,e</xref>). To assess whether the increase in plasma LDL in hepatocyte COMMD1-deficient mice is caused by aberrant VLDL homeostasis, VLDL production and secretion were measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>, no differences were found in VLDL production and secretion, indicating that COMMD1 is not involved in VLDL homeostasis. Furthermore, we observed no alterations in hepatic expression of genes and proteins involved in cholesterol uptake, synthesis or efflux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g,h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). However, consistent with results from COMMD1-deficient dogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), CCDC22 and CCDC93 levels were both markedly decreased in <italic>Commd1</italic>-ablated hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g,h</xref>). With the notion that all members of the COMMD family can associate with the CCC complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, we assessed if COMMD9 is also involved in cholesterol homeostasis. We therefore deleted <italic>Commd9</italic> specifically in hepatocytes by intravenous injection of recombinant adenovirus carrying Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre) in conditional <italic>Commd9</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Commd9</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup>) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). As a negative control mice were injected with adenovirus carrying the <italic>LacZ</italic> gene (Ad-LacZ). Cre-mediated ablation of <italic>Commd9</italic> resulted in a clear reduction in hepatic <italic>Commd9</italic> mRNA and COMMD9 protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Similarly, as shown in hepatocytes lacking COMMD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g,h</xref>), hepatic COMMD9 inactivation resulted in a decrease in CCDC22 and CCDC93 protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), which was accompanied by an increase in plasma cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). Together, these data indicate that mutations affecting the formation of the CCC complex cause hypercholesterolaemia.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>COMMD1 binds to LDLR through its COMM domain</title><p>Plasma LDL cholesterol levels are largely dependent on functional LDL receptors in the liver, and since the CCC complex mediates the trafficking of various transmembrane proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, we investigated whether COMMD1 interacts with LDLR and is required for normal LDLR function. Pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated a clear association between COMMD1 and LDLR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and continuous sucrose gradient fractionation of fresh liver homogenates showed overlap in the cellular distribution of COMMD1 and LDLR, which support a physical association between COMMD1 and LDLR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). We found that this COMMD1&#x02013;LDLR interaction depends on the NPxY-based trafficking motif within the cytoplasmic tail of LDLR and on the COMM domain of COMMD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). Although additional studies are needed to determine whether the interaction between COMMD1 and LDLR is direct, our results are consistent with previous studies, which demonstrated that the NPxY motif is essential for the binding of various LDLR adaptor proteins involved in the intracellular trafficking of LDLR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>WASH components colocalize and interact with LDLR</title><p>Our prior work demonstrated that the CCC complex acts in conjunction with the multi-subunit WASH complex to mediate the trafficking of ATP7A (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), and this motivated us to assess the cellular distribution of the WASH complex and retromer relative to LDLR. Isopycnic centrifugation of murine liver lysates showed a marked overlap in the cellular distribution of LDLR with WASH components (WASH1 and FAM21), as well as with CCC components (CCDC22 and COMMD1), and to a lesser extent with the retromer component VPS35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assays revealed that WASH1 and FAM21 can both bind to LDLR, but no physical association was detected between VPS35 and LDLR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). In addition, the interaction between the PDZ-domain-containing sortin nexin 27 (SNX27) and LDLR was assessed as SNX27 is required for retrieval and recycling of numerous transmembrane proteins, including several members of the LDLR family (for example, VLDLR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, no interaction of LDLR and SXN27 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Furthermore, the subcellular localization of SNX27 and its binding to FAM21 was not affected by COMMD1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).

Loss of COMMD1 decreased the colocalization of LDLR with the early endosomal marker EEA1 and the lysosomal marker LAMP1, but increased LDLR localization to a VPS35-enriched endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>), suggesting that LDLR might not be able to traffic normally from retromer-coated endosomes to other compartments. Next, we quantified surface levels of LDLR in WT and <italic>Commd1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> MEFs by using a surface biotinylation assay. Although total LDLR levels were not affected by the loss of COMMD1, cell surface levels of LDLR were markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>).

To assess the functional effect of LDLR mislocalization and decreased LDLR surface levels on LDL cellular uptake, we added fluorescently labelled LDL (Dil-LDL) to the medium and determined the level of endocytosed LDL.

In addition, removal of WASH resulted in collapsed endosomal structures, as shown previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Although COMMD1 levels were not affected by WASH deficiency, LDLR protein levels were markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), but were restored by the treatment with the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e,f</xref>), as shown for epidermal growth factor receptor levels in WASH-deficient cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In addition to a reduction in total LDLR levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), LDLR levels at the cell surface were decreased in <italic>Wash1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> MEFs, as demonstrated by a surface biotinylation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g,h</xref>). To assess whether mislocalization and reduced levels of LDLR in <italic>Wash1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> cells affect LDL uptake, Dil-LDL was added to the media. Dil-LDL uptake was visualized by microscopy and subsequently quantified. WASH1 depletion markedly diminished LDL cellular uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5i,j</xref>). It has been demonstrated that WASH-mediated actin polymerization on the endosomal membrane is crucial for endosomal sorting of specific cargos, and loss of WASH1 results in endosomal collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Indeed, restoring WT WASH1 in WASH1-deficient cells rescued the accumulation of LDLR in collapsed endosomes, which could not be prevented by expressing WASH1-&#x00394;VCA, a deletion mutant that cannot activate the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).

However, the mechanisms regulating the trafficking of LDLR are not completely understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Here we identified that the multi-subunit protein complexes CCC and WASH are required for LDLR endosomal sorting and for directing the receptor to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Mutations affecting the formation of these complexes are causally related to hypercholesterolaemia in humans, dogs and mice.</p><p>COMMD1 was initially identified as a regulator of copper homeostasis in mammals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>; however, here we uncover that COMMD1 is also critically important in cholesterol homeostasis. According to our previous work revealing that COMMD1 and the CCC complex regulate the endosomal sorting of the copper transporter ATP7A (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), we found that this same system similarly regulates the endosomal trafficking of LDLR. We demonstrated this in a variety of cellular models, and the physiologic importance of our observations has been substantiated in two independent mammalian models of COMMD1 deficiency, which display increased plasma LDL cholesterol. In agreement with these models, deleterious human mutations in <italic>CCDC22</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) are causally linked to elevated plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels in affected patients. The atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype of these patients is similar to that of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia caused by heterozygous <italic>LDLR</italic> mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, but cholesterol levels do not reach the high levels seen in patients with homozygous mutations in either <italic>LDLR</italic>, <italic>ARH</italic> (autosomal recessive hypercholesterolaemia) or <italic>APOB</italic> (apolipoprotein B), or in patients with a gain-of-function mutation in <italic>PCSK9</italic> (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). In addition, elevated TC and LDL cholesterol levels were found in a RSS patient, with a homozygous mutation in the <italic>KIAA0196</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>&#x02014;encoding for a component of the WASH complex&#x02014;thus indicating that WASH dysfunction might also cause aberrant cholesterol homeostasis.

This line of thought is reinforced by the observation that all 10 members of the COMMD family can engage in the CCC complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, and by our recent work showing that the trafficking of Notch, another cargo of this system, is particularly dependent on COMMD9 in various cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Although these observations advocate for the presence of CCC subcomplexes in cargo selectively trafficking, here we found that deletion of <italic>Commd9</italic> in hepatocytes also causes increased plasma cholesterol in mice, which indicates that the composition of these subcomplexes and their roles in cargo trafficking are likely cell type specific. Further research is therefore warranted to dissect the contribution of the COMMD proteins in cargo selectively trafficking.</p><p>The retromer&#x02013;WASH-associated SNX27 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) interacts with the NPxY-based trafficking motif<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, and here we assessed whether SNX27 is engaged in CCC/WASH-mediated LDLR trafficking. In agreement with prior work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, we did not find SNX27 in the interactome of LDLR. Furthermore, ablation of COMMD1 did not affect SNX27&#x02013;FAM21 interaction or subcellular localization of SNX27.

Interestingly, the SNX27 family member SNX17 has been identified as an adaptor of LDLR.

SNX17 and COMMD1 both colocalize to vesicles positive for the early endosome marker EEA1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), but in contrast to COMMD1, localization studies did not demonstrate overlap between SNX17 and LDLR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesize that the action of SNX17 on LDLR trafficking precedes CCC- and WASH-mediated endosomal sorting of LDLR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). In addition to SNX17, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDGR1) also regulates the trafficking of LDLR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Loss of NDRG1 reduces LDLR levels on the cell surface accompanied by impaired LDL uptake. In addition, cells deficient for NDRG1 display accumulation of inducible degrader of the LDLR (IDOL)-mediated ubiquitinated LDLR in multivesicular bodies, whose structure is deformed by NDRG1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>).
