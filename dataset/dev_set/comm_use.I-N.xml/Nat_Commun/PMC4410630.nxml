This leads to the enhancement of the interaction with any object within the mode<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> by a factor proportional to <italic>Q</italic>/<italic>V</italic>. As a result, the presence of even nanoscale objects within the evanescent field of the WGM can lead to detectable variations in its spectrum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Specifically, these variations include broadening (due to shortening of the cavity lifetime)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, splitting (due to induced crosstalk between its two counter-propagating modes)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> or a shift (due to modification of the optical path length)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The typical scale of all these spectral variations is of the order of a few MHz or more, in principle allowing their detection on a timescale of less than a microsecond.</p><p>However, although there are fast methods to separately measure splitting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, broadening<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> or a shift<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, the only method for obtaining the full spectrum had so far been laser scanning. Laser scanning is slow not only because of technical reasons. It is inherently slow since to accurately capture the cavity spectrum, the laser must scan over the cavity resonance (of width 2<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>) during a time long enough for the intracavity field to continuously maintain a steady state. The timescale for this duration is determined by the cavity lifetime <italic>&#x003c4;</italic> (=1/4<italic>&#x003c0;&#x003ba;</italic>), meaning that the scan rate needs to be significantly slower than <italic>&#x003ba;</italic>/<italic>&#x003c4;</italic>. Accordingly, to acquire a spectral scan over a total bandwidth <italic>B</italic>, the total scan time needs to exceed <italic>N&#x003c4;</italic>, with <italic>N</italic>=<italic>B</italic>/<italic>&#x003ba;</italic> representing the effective number of frequency points acquired during the scan. Yet this scan time is not optimal&#x02014;the fundamental limit for the duration of such a spectral measurement is defined by the time&#x02013;bandwidth uncertainty relation (or the Fourier limit) and is set by the desired spectral resolution (<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>) to be roughly <italic>&#x003c4;</italic>. In other words, a scan measurement is at least <italic>N</italic> times slower than a Fourier-limited one.</p><p>Here we present cavity ring-up spectroscopy (CRUS) as an ultrafast method for acquiring complete spectral snapshots of WGM resonators at the minimal timescale set by the Fourier limit. CRUS relies on the abrupt turn-on of far-detuned probe laser pulses (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>&#x0226b;2<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>), which are coupled to the WGM microresonator (a microtoroid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> in our case) through a tapered optical fibre<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. At such a large detuning, most of the light is transmitted through the fibre without entering the cavity. However, the short rise time <italic>t</italic><sub>r</sub> of the pulse corresponds to a broad spectral distribution of bandwidth <italic>B</italic>&#x0223c;1/<italic>t</italic><sub>r</sub>. Accordingly, if the cavity resonance lies within this bandwidth (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>B</italic>), this turn-on leads to the build-up of a small, transient field in the cavity. This field then radiates back into the fibre, where it interferes with the transmitted field, creating a ring-up signal. The spectrum can now be retrieved with a resolution of &#x0223c;<italic>&#x003ba;</italic> (or better) by acquiring this ring-up signal during a time of <italic>&#x003c4;</italic> (or longer).</p><p>CRUS therefore enables monitoring kinetics and events in the nanosecond regime, drastically expanding the capabilities demonstrated in previous schemes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, which have focused on the slow detection of long-term events, such as binding of viruses or nanoparticles to the surface of the microresonator. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate how CRUS captures variations of WGM spectra due to different nonlinear mechanisms, induced by a separate pump laser. In particular, we directly observe the spectrum of a resonator oscillating mechanically at 12.5&#x02009;MHz.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Principles of CRUS</title><p>The configuration of CRUS, outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, is reminiscent of the well-known method of cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), in which the field emitted from a cavity is directly measured by abruptly turning off a resonant probe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. CRDS is widely used as a sensitive method for absorption spectroscopy of gaseous samples in Fabry&#x02013;P&#x000e9;rot resonators. Since CRDS captures only the intensity of the ring-down signal, it provides no knowledge of the centre frequency of the resonance, and therefore cannot be used to detect spectral shifts (nor does it enable reconstruction of asymmetric spectra). Accordingly, its application to WGM microresonators has so far been limited to <italic>Q</italic>-factor measurements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>In contrast, in CRUS, the far-detuned probe, which continues in the fibre, serves as a local oscillator as it interferes with the emitted cavity field. The result is therefore a robust heterodyne measurement of both the amplitude and the phase of the cavity field, which allows the unambiguous extraction of the complete spectrum, including its centre frequency. The difference between CRUS and CRDS is therefore analogous to the difference between a hologram, which captures both the amplitude and the directionality of the object wavefront, to a picture, which captures only its intensity. In this view, the large detuning between the probe and the resonance is analogous to the large angular separation between the reference beam and the object in an off-axis hologram, which prevents overlap between positive and negative frequencies (the object and its conjugate) during the reconstruction.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Spectrum retrieval</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> presents the measured ring-up signal, defined as <italic>s</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)=(|<italic>y</italic>|<sup>2</sup>&#x02212;|<italic>x</italic>|<sup>2</sup>)/(<italic>x</italic>), where <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> are the input and output fields, respectively. The main features of the WGM resonance already appear in this signal. Accordingly, <italic>s</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) enables complete retrieval of the transmission spectrum <italic>T</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>)=|<italic>Y</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>)/<italic>X</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>)|<sup>2</sup>, which by the final value theorem is identical to that obtained by frequency scanning (where <italic>X</italic>,<italic>Y</italic> are the Fourier transforms of <italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>). This is done by noting that the output field results from interference between the input field and the emission from the cavity, that is, <italic>Y</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>)=<italic>X</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>)&#x0002b;<italic>X</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>)<italic>H</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>), where <italic>H</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>) is the cavity's transfer function. By Fourier transforming the ring-up signal <italic>s</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and using the fact that due to the large detuning <italic>H</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>) contains only positive frequencies, we get <italic>H</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>)=<italic>S</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>)/<italic>X</italic>(<italic>&#x003c9;</italic>), finally yielding (see Methods)</p><p><disp-formula id="eq1"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e411" xlink:href="ncomms7788-m1.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1c</xref> presents the spectrum obtained from a single-shot, 500-ns pulse performed on a resonance with <italic>Q</italic>=1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> at 780&#x02009;nm, showing an excellent agreement with the much-slower (5&#x02009;ms) single-shot scan measurement. The fundamental origin of the drastic difference between the speeds of CRUS and a regular scan is clearly illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, which simulates scans of the spectrum of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> at various speeds. The fact that CRUS is a transform-limited measurement, whereas a scan measurement is not, is clearly exhibited by the ringing effects that appear at short scan times<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>The ability to rapidly capture the entire spectrum also makes CRUS more resilient to various noise mechanisms (such as amplitude noise) that typically occur at lower frequencies and can distort a scan measurement, which samples different parts of the spectrum at different times. Indeed, as evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, the signal-to-noise ratio of CRUS is comparable to that of the much-slower scan. CRUS also has the inherent advantage of heterodyne measurements, which enable shot-noise limited sensitivities (as shown in the extraction of decay rates from beat-note signals generated either by sweeping<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> or shifting the probe frequency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, or by non-linearity-induced shifts of the resonance itself<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Sensitive detection of weak fields is extremely important with WGM microresonators, in which the intracavity power must be kept very low, to prevent the onset of undesired non-linearities.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Demonstration of rapid spectral acquisition using CRUS</title><p>As a first demonstration of the potential of CRUS for capturing ultrafast phenomena, we applied it to fully characterize the non-linearities of the microtoroid.

As demonstrated in previous works<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, for modulation frequencies below &#x0223c;1&#x02009;MHz, the non-linearity of the microtoroid is dominated by its thermal response, which is governed by two processes with different timescales<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The short timescale is set by the conduction rate of heat from the optical mode to the rest of the cavity, and the longer corresponds to dissipation of heat from the entire cavity to the silicon substrate through the pillar. The high rate of CRUS allows the accurate extraction of these timescales directly from the cavity's temporal response to abrupt turn-off of the pump, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>.</p><p>The CRUS measurements also reveal a phase lag of 50&#x000b1;1&#x000b0; between the cavity oscillations and the pump modulation (inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), which is a result of the interplay between the two capacitive thermal mechanisms and the much weaker, frequency-independent Kerr nonlinearity. By measuring this phase shift as a function of modulation frequency, we find that the heating per intracavity energy is 67&#x02009;K/nJ for the slow mechanism and 7&#x02009;K/nJ for the fast mechanism, in good agreement with theory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3c</xref> shows the cavity's centre frequency response to abrupt turn-on of a pump laser modulated at 5.5&#x02009;MHz, extracted from spectral snapshots taken every 37&#x02009;ns. At this high frequency, the non-linearity of the cavity is dominated by the Kerr effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> (superimposed on the slower thermal drift), with the corresponding instantaneous response exhibited by a nearly zero phase shift (4&#x000b1;1&#x000b0;) with respect to the pump modulation (see inset).</p><p>As a final demonstration of the capabilities of CRUS, we directly monitor optomechanical oscillations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> of the microtoroid at a rate much faster than the oscillation frequency. Such pulsed measurements are of particular interest in the context of quantum non-demolition measurements of mechanical motion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. For this purpose, we tuned the pump to excite the second-order crown mode of the microtoroid (inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref> presents the measured time-varying spectrum of a 90-MHz WGM resonance, captured at intervals of 25&#x02009;ns.

Here the spectra were taken at intervals of 16&#x02009;ns. The extracted phase difference between the mechanical oscillations and the pump is 89&#x000b1;1&#x000b0;, in agreement with the expected value of <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>/2 for a resonantly driven oscillator. The resonant behaviour of these oscillations is also exhibited by the fact that they continue after the pump is abruptly turned off. By measuring the decay rate of these oscillations, we obtain a mechanical quality factor of 300. These results provide the first direct observation of optomechanical oscillations by continuous monitoring of the entire WGM spectrum&#x02014;a task far beyond the ability of laser scanning.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By acquiring maximal knowledge on the spectrum at the shortest possible timescale, CRUS introduces the promising field of optical sensing with WGM microresonators into the nanosecond regime.
