However, electron beams typically create high-energy excitations that severely accelerate sample degradation. Here this major difficulty is overcome using an &#x02018;aloof' electron beam, positioned tens of nanometres away from the sample: high-energy excitations are suppressed, while vibrational modes of energies &#x0003c;1&#x02009;eV can be &#x02018;safely' investigated. To demonstrate the potential of aloof spectroscopy, we record electron energy loss spectra from biogenic guanine crystals in their native state, resolving their characteristic C&#x02013;H, N&#x02013;H and C=O vibrational signatures with no observable radiation damage. The technique opens up the possibility of non-damaging compositional analyses of organic functional groups, including non-crystalline biological materials, at a spatial resolution of &#x0223c;10&#x02009;nm, simultaneously combined with imaging in the electron microscope.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

These techniques provide structural information, but do not probe the sample properties. They are also insensitive to the presence of hydrogen, the most common element in organic molecules, and to how hydrogen is bonded to other atoms. Although it is possible to acquire infrared spectra at a spatial resolution of better than 100&#x02009;nm using tip-enhanced infrared absorption in an atomic force microscopy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, the technique is limited to films that are flat over an extended region. Selecting the amide I absorption peak, Berweger <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> showed that it was possible to map the distribution of bacteriorhodopsin in phospholipid bilayer. If spectroscopy carried out in the electron microscope could be extended to the visible and infrared region, then it should be possible to use electron microscopy to not only determine overall morphology but also to find where functionally significant biomolecules, such as chromophores and proteins, are located within the overall structure at high spatial resolution.</p><p>The damage an energetic electron beam causes to the biological sample is another key limitation of present-day electron microscope imaging and analysis. Avoiding the damage requires that the electron fluence be kept at a very low level, typically of the order of &#x0003c;10&#x02009;e&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), and this severely limits the spatial resolution at which biological samples can be imaged and analysed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Methods for minimizing the radiation damage include averaging the information over many unit cells of a periodic sample, averaging over many identical structural units in a non-periodic sample<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> examining cryogenically preserved specimens at liquid nitrogen temperatures (cryo-TEM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and using direct electron detectors to fractionate dose among many image frames<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>Recent developments have demonstrated electron microscope resolution of infrared features, by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) carried out with an energy resolution of &#x0223c;10&#x02009;meV (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). This has made it possible to record spectra showing vibrational features of hydrogen-containing inorganic materials such as metal hydrides, but the approach has not been applied to biological samples. Aloof beam spectroscopy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> was proposed by Cohen <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> as a near-field spectroscopy probe and was used by Krivanek <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> to acquire vibrational spectra from titanium hydride. The theoretical advantage of using aloof beams to avoid radiation damage has recently been explored by Egerton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The key advantage of aloof spectroscopy is that for a tightly focused beam passing a distance <italic>d</italic> outside the sample, damage-causing high-energy interactions are suppressed relative to information-providing low-energy interactions. In other words, an ability to accurately control the beam&#x02013;sample distance has an important advantage: one can choose the effective range of energy transferred to the sample, similar to what can be achieved with photon techniques by adjusting the beam energy range. Thus, it is not just the beam intensity, or scattering cross-section that is varied, but the fundamental characteristics of beam&#x02013;sample interaction. Specifically, by selecting <italic>d</italic>-values that do not allow energy transfers above the infrared regime, one can perform measurements that are, in principle, similar to probing with infrared irradiation, hence with minimal damage.</p><p>Here we show that aloof electron beam vibrational spectroscopy can be carried out at an energy resolution sufficient to probe different types of bonds in biological samples, including those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, with no significant radiation damage.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Vibrational spectroscopy</title><p>To demonstrate control over beam&#x02013;sample interaction, we apply the aloof beam EELS configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) for the detection of electronic and vibrational peaks in guanine, one of the DNA bases. Anhydrous guanine in its crystalline form has a strong anisotropic dielectric response that is used in nature by organisms such as fish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, arthropods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and reptiles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> for manipulating light. Crystals extracted from the scales of the Japanese Koi fish (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) were purified and placed on Cu holey carbon-coated TEM grid (see Methods for details). They are in the form of rhombohedral plates &#x0223c;10-&#x003bc;m long and 30-nm thick. A typical guanine crystal is shown in the TEM image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). It is lying on a holey carbon film, such that the e-beam of a Nion UltraSTEM can be directed through vacuum at a distance <italic>d</italic> from the side of the crystal that can be accurately controlled in a range of 10&#x02013;250&#x02009;nm, as shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>. The scattering wavevectors perpendicular to the beam direction <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> in the plane of the specimen are much greater than <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Also, under our experimental conditions, dipole scattering dominates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The planar guanine molecules (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) with 1 C=O bond, 1 NH<sub>2</sub> group, 1 CH bond, 2 NH bonds and 7 C&#x02013;N bonds all in the same plane are stacked parallel to the surface of the crystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This means that we selectively excite vibrations in the plane of the guanine molecule.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref> presents an EEL spectrum in the infrared range, as recorded at a distance <italic>d</italic>=30&#x02009;nm from the crystal edge with beam energy of 60&#x02009;keV. Close agreement with the infrared absorption spectrum, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, of anhydrous guanine crystals (acquired <italic>ex situ</italic>) is found, including the detailed peak positions given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. The most prominent feature is the peak from the C=O stretch at 209&#x02009;meV. All the peaks that can be attributed to stretching of hydrogen covalently bonded to nitrogen or carbon have been identified in the spectrum as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. Thus, this spectrum demonstrates not only the detection of hydrogen but also the capability of resolving different hydrogen-related vibrations. The peak intensities increase as the electron probe is moved closer to the specimen edge, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> is a dark-field image showing the positions of the electron probe.

Strong peaks at 4.04 and 6&#x02009;eV are observed, with a weaker peak at 4.94&#x02009;eV, superimposed on a broad spectral band. These features have been observed in the dielectric response derived from ultraviolet ellipsometry of thin films of guanine on Si(111) substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and polarized reflection spectra of 9-ethylguanine and guanine hydrochlodirde dihydrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The 4.04&#x02009;eV peak is due to &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0;&#x0002a; transitions from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital as supported by both self consistent field<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and density functional theory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> calculations. The 6&#x02009;eV peak is due to transitions from the highest occupied molecular orbital to a <italic>&#x003c3;</italic>&#x0002a; level. The broad band is associated with the tails of a &#x003c0;-collective plasmonic excitation. The 4&#x02013;6&#x02009;eV peaks become visible when the probe is within 15&#x02009;nm of the edge, but as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> the intensity of higher-energy loss features increases significantly only when the electron probe is very close to the specimen edge.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Damage-free vibrational spectroscopy</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a,c</xref> shows how the intensity of vibrational EELS signals varies with time for a beam situated at a fixed position. A slow decay is observed for <italic>d</italic>=10&#x02009;nm, taking place on a timescale of 30&#x02009;min. The time for the intensity to decay by a factor of <italic>1</italic>/<italic>e</italic> is 53&#x02009;min for the bonds of carbon and nitrogen with hydrogen and 68&#x02009;min for the carbon oxygen bond. This would imply that hydrogen is broken off in the first stage of radiation damage. Visible signs of damage are also observed in the image taken immediately after this data was acquired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). These patches are similar in appearance to what is observed when the electron probe is stationary on the specimen for 20&#x02009;s as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>. Even with a low electron flux of 0.02 electrons per nm<sup>2</sup> per s, as would be typical in cryo-electron microscopy, there is little high-resolution structural information remaining after exposure for just over 1&#x02009;min, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>.</p><p>It would be expected that the lateral distribution of damage would be confined to &#x0223c;10&#x02009;nm, which is the distance of the probe from the sample edge and hence the scale of dominant interaction. However, damage is also observed further away in this case. In a discussion on damage caused by fast secondary electrons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, it has been proposed that it mainly originates from K shell excitations. For a beam 10&#x02009;nm outside the specimen, it is not possible to excite K edges; hence the electrons causing this damage very likely originate from lower-energy excitations. Remarkably, and in contrast to the measurement at 10&#x02009;nm distance, no damage is observed when the beam is 30&#x02009;nm from the edge, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4 c,d</xref>. The reason for this striking difference between the two beam positions is that a critical energy is crossed at this <italic>d</italic>-range: the ionization energy of guanine is &#x0223c;7&#x02009;eV, which translates into &#x0223c;14&#x02009;nm (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The lateral spatial resolution is approximately given by the distance of the electron beam from the specimen edge. In the electron microscopy of beam-sensitive specimens, spatial resolution is limited by the need to restrict the electron beam fluence to avoid damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In this sense, aloof beam spectroscopy is similar to other forms of electron microscopy and spectroscopy in that there is a tradeoff between damage and spatial resolution. An advantage of aloof beam spectroscopy is that vibrational spectral features can be safely detected before bringing the beam closer to the sample and before damage becomes apparent. Furthermore, it is possible to directly monitor which bonds are being broken given that radiation damage often involves ejection of hydrogen, either by a knockon impact process or by radiolysis. By resolving the infrared signatures of hydrogen attached to different atoms as the electron probe gets closer to the specimen within a range of 10&#x02009;nm, the sensitivity of radiation damage to ionization events of different energies can be explored.</p><p>In practical applications aloof beam spectroscopy will be complementary to tip-enhanced infrared absorption. The main difference is the nature of the specimen. Flat films are better studied using scanning probe infrared absorption, while aloof beam EELS is more appropriate for TEM specimens where the features of interest lie close to an edge. The spatial resolution of electron beam techniques applied to biological specimens is limited by the ability to tolerate damage. If high resolution is required, the electron beam can be moved very close to, or even on to, the specimen for brief periods to achieve nanometre or better resolution. The spatial resolution of tip-enhanced infrared absorption is approximately the tip radius of &#x0223c;20&#x02009;nm, as demonstrated by Huth <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. At present, tip-enhanced infrared spectroscopy has superior energy resolution, but the spectral range is limited by the laser power to 600&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (75&#x02009;meV). In electron spectroscopy (within the electron microscope), excitations of all energies take place simultaneously, from vibrational modes to plasmons and single-electron excitations with energies equivalent to ultraviolet and soft X-ray photons. We have shown that by controlling the distance of an external narrow electron probe from the edge of a specimen, we can selectively probe vibrational modes without exciting energies above the energy thresholds that potentially lead to radiation damage. This can be seen graphically in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>, which shows strong infrared peaks when the electron probe is outside the specimen while the features corresponding to ultraviolet excitations are hardly detectable. Moreover, by stepping outside the sample, we avoid high-momentum transfer impact processes (knock on damage) that eject or displace light atoms. This is especially significant for biological samples that are predominately composed of light elements. Notably, in contrast to optical spectroscopy, we still retain all the advantages of electron microscopy, with fast and easy control of the electron beam, and with the ability to easily change <italic>d</italic>-values or move to a different area on the sample.</p><p>The superior high-energy resolution provided by the present monochromated electron microscope<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> is an important ingredient of the proposed approach. For example, we have successfully distinguished the vibrational modes of hydrogen covalently bonded to carbon versus nitrogen and clearly resolved the peak due to stretching of the C=O bond. Further improvements in the energy resolution will make it possible to record all peaks corresponding to modes with frequencies greater than &#x0223c;50&#x02009;meV (400&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), encompassing much of the useful range in infrared absorption spectroscopy.</p><p>To realize its full potential for characterizing biological specimens damage free, aloof beam EELS should be combined with cryo-TEM. Complementary information can then be obtained from low-dose imaging and aloof beam electron spectroscopy. We have already resolved the C=O stretch, one of the amide peaks characteristic of proteins. An improvement in resolution to 5&#x02009;meV would make it possible to clearly resolve the other amide peaks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and analyse the secondary structure of proteins in the electron microscope in a damage-free mode, while determining overall morphology using standard low-dose imaging techniques in the same instrument. Using the NH stretch vibrational mode, it should be possible to localize proteins in membranes at nanometre resolution. Exciting possibilities of distinguishing other significant biological molecules from their vibrational or optical signature are expected to be realized by our approach, enabling nanometre-level resolution of functional groups in biological structures.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>Japanese Koi fish (<italic>Cyprinus capio</italic>) were purchased from Peka (Rehovot, Israel) and were maintained in an aquarium at the animal care facility in the Weizmann Institute of Science.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Guanine crystals extraction</title><p>Fish scales were mechanically removed and washed with double deionized water (DDW).

Acquisition parameters for the spectrum in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> were 40&#x02009;s and 2&#x02009;meV per channel, and for the spectrum shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> were 7&#x02009;s and 5&#x02009;meV per channel.</p><p>The spectrum shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> was acquired using the Nion HERMES system at Rutgers University. It was equipped with a Nion prototype spectrometer with first- to fourth-order aberration correction and a 2k &#x000d7; 2k pixel lens optically coupled with CMOS camera. The scintillator is constructed such that the ZLP completely missed the scintillator, and hence the ZLP tail due to light spread in the scintillator was greatly suppressed. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref> shows how this significantly reduces the background intensity. A power-law background was fitted between 66.7 and 96.13&#x02009;meV. The EELS dispersion was 0.46&#x02009;meV per channel, and the energy resolution (half width of the ZLP, measured in a spectrum recorded separately) was 8&#x02009;meV. The accelerating voltage was 60&#x02009;kV, the probe diameter was &#x0223c;2&#x02009;nm and the probe current &#x0223c;2&#x02009;pA. The probe convergence semi-angle was 15&#x02009;mrad, and the EELS collection semi-angle was 13&#x02009;mrad. The spectrum shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> is an average of 19 energy-aligned spectra, each with 10&#x02009;s acquisition time, taken from a point 30&#x02009;nm from the edge of the guanine crystal.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TEM diffraction</title><p>TEM diffraction of the guanine crystals was conducted on an FEI Tecnai F20 microscope with the beam spread out over micron-sized regions at room temperature. Electron diffraction patterns were recorded on a Gatan US4000 charge-coupled device camera.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Spectrum processing</title><p>With the exception of the spectrum shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, separate backgrounds were fit under the C=O peak, and the CH, NH and NH<sub>2</sub> peaks. The fitting regions were 0.16&#x02013;0.18 and 0.23&#x02013;0.25&#x02009;eV for the C=O peak, and 0.25&#x02013;0.29 and 0.45&#x02009;eV&#x02013;0.52&#x02009;eV for the stretching modes involving hydrogen. The C=O peak was the intensity remaining from 0.18 to 0.23&#x02009;eV after background subtraction, and the peak corresponding the CH, NH and NH<sub>2</sub> stretches was the intensity remaining from 0.29 to 0.45&#x02009;eV after background subtraction. These energy windows were used for the integrated intensities plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">4a,b</xref>, though the window for fitting the power-law background under the compound CH, NH and NH<sub>2</sub> stretch peaks was modified to stop at 0.48&#x02009;eV and the integration window ended at 0.43&#x02009;eV, due to problems with a defective pixels in the detector array in the spectra used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> shows the raw and background subtracted spectra.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Rez, P. <italic>et al</italic>.
