Sequential proteolytic processing of APP, catalyzed by &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretase, generates the neurotoxic peptide amyloid-&#x003b2; (A&#x003b2;), which accumulates in the brain and cause progressive neurodegeneration. However, APP is mainly processed through another pathway, where APP is cleaved by &#x003b1;- and &#x003b3;-secretase, generating the secreted sAPP&#x003b1; fragment. Stimulation of &#x003b1;-secretase processing of APP constitutes an important therapeutical strategy, not only since it precludes the formation of A&#x003b2;, but also because the sAPP&#x003b1; fragment has been shown to have neuroprotective properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. APP was the first plasma membrane protein shown to be O-GlcNAcylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], a dynamic post-translational modification involving the attachment of &#x003b2;-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase. However, the consequences of APP O-GlcNAcylation have so far not been investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><p>We have used siRNA and pharmacological inhibitors directed against O-GlcNAcase and O-GlcNAc transferase to determine these enzymes regulate O-GlcNAcylation of APP. O-GlcNacylated proteins were immunioprecipiated from cell-lysates using an O-GlcNAc antibody, and APP was then detected by western blot using. The levels of sAPP&#x003b1; and A&#x003b2; in the cell medium were analyzed using western blot and ELISA. The studies were mainly preformed in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, but other cell-lines were used as well as a comparison.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Here, we show that O-GlcNAcase and O-GlcNAc transferase regulate the level of APP that is immunoprecipitated with O-GlcNAc antibody in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We also show that O-GlcNAcylation increases &#x003b1;-secretase processing, resulting in increased levels of the neuroprotective sAPP&#x003b1; fragment and decreased A&#x003b2; secretion. The proteolytic processing of the APP homologue, APLP2, remained unchanged in response to increased O-GlcNAcylation. Furthermore, the effect of O-GlcNacylation on APP processing seems to be specific for neuron-like cells, since the levels of sAPP&#x003b1; from the human embryonic kidney cell-line HEK293 remains unchanged in response to inhibition of O-GlcNAcase, whereas the neuroblastoma cell-line SK-N-AS show increased sAPP&#x003b1; levels, but not to the same extent as in SH-SY5Y cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that increased O-GlcNacylation selectively affects APP processing in neuro-like cells. Our results implicate O-GlcNAcylation as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Mattson</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Culwell</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Esch</surname><given-names>FS</given-names></name><name><surname>Lieberburg</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Rydel</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><article-title>Evidence for excitoprotective and intraneuronal calcium-regulating roles for secreted forms of the &#x003b2;-amyloid precursor protein</article-title><source>Neuron</source><year>1993</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>243</fpage><lpage>254</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/0896-6273(93)90315-I</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8094963</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Griffith</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name><name><surname>Mathes</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmitz</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><article-title>Beta-amyloid precursor protein is modified with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine</article-title><source>J Neurosci Res</source><year>1995</year><volume>41</volume><fpage>270</fpage><lpage>278</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/jnr.490410214</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7650762</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
