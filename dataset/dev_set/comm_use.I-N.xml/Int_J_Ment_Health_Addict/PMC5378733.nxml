Regardless of legislative prohibition for underage gambling, adolescents gamble on both regulated and unregulated gambling media (Forrest and McHale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>; Volberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>; Blinn-Pike et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>; Stinchfield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>). There are several short- and longer-term consequences of problem gambling among adolescents, which can negatively affect adolescents&#x02019; overall social functioning, mental health, academic performance, and quality of life (Derevensky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>; Shead et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2010</xref>; Castr&#x000e9;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). Thus, adolescent gambling and problem gambling have been rightfully identified as public health concerns (Blinn-Pike et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>; Messerlian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>). Despite this, adolescent gambling and problem gambling have been shown to be perceived as less problematic than other risk behaviours (e.g., drug use, violence in schools or spending too much time online) among parents, teachers and mental health professionals (Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>; Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>; Temcheff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>).</p><p>Adolescence is a sensitive period of life during which many risk behaviours, including gambling, are typically adopted (Dickson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2004</xref>). However, unlike alcohol or other substance abuse, adolescent problem gambling is not as visible and therefore may be less easily detectable by parents, teachers, and even mental health professionals in schools (Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>), thus it is not often perceived as a form of adolescent risk behaviour (Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>; Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>; Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2016</xref>; Temcheff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>). Nevertheless, internationally, the prevalence of adolescent problem/disordered gambling varies between 0.9 and 8.1&#x000a0;% (Volberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Adolescent Gambling in Finland</title><p>Despite the legal gambling age of 18&#x000a0;years, which was raised from 15 to 18&#x000a0;years in 2010, with giving slot machines a 1-year transition period, which ended 2011, adolescents engage themselves in gambling activities (Salonen and Raisamo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). Availability and accessibility to gambling opportunities in Finland is relatively exceptional. Approximately 20 000 slot machines are not only available in gambling venues but in kiosks, shops, shopping centers, hotels, coffee shops, gas stations where youngsters have access into (Warpenius et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>). Based on a population study (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4566) conducted in 2011, 44&#x000a0;% of 12 to18-year-old Finns had gambled during the past 6&#x000a0;months (Raisamo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). Furthermore, a nationwide School Health Promotion Study (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;101,167) conducted in 2010&#x02013;2011 revealed that 62&#x000a0;% of the 14 to16-year-olds had gambled during the previous year (R&#x000e4;s&#x000e4;nen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>). Depending on different methodological (e.g., severity of gambling problem measures, sampling, time) and geographical aspects, Finnish prevalence estimates for adolescent at-risk and problem gambling vary from 2.3 to 10.7&#x000a0;% (Ilkas and Aho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>; Castr&#x000e9;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>; R&#x000e4;s&#x000e4;nen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2016a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Impact of Adults&#x02019; Attitudes on Adolescent Risk Behaviours</title><p>Given teachers spend a considerable amount of time with adolescents on a daily basis, they remain in a good position to identify youth for multiple risky behaviors. Teachers&#x02019; perceptions of adolescent risky behaviours has recently been surveyed in Canada (Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>) and Romania (Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). The results revealed that only 20&#x000a0;% of the Canadian teachers and 44.3&#x000a0;% of the Romanian teachers perceived gambling as a serious adolescent issue, and were the least concern compared to other potentially adolescent risky behaviours (e.g., drug use, violence or bullying, excessive online activities, excessive video game playing, smoking).</p><p>Previous research has revealed that parents&#x02019; positive attitudes towards gambling (Shead et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>) and problem gambling behaviour (Delfabbro and Thrupp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>; Magoon and Ingersoll <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>) result in increased adolescent gambling. Campbell and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>) in Canada, reported that only 40&#x000a0;% of parents perceived adolescent gambling as a serious risk behaviour. In fact, adolescent gambling was rated as the least risky behaviour among 13 other potential risk behaviours, suggesting a general lack of concern regarding adolescent gambling. Similarly, more recent studies revealed that mental health professionals in schools also viewed problem gambling as the least serious adolescent risk behaviour (Temcheff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>; Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). At present, parents, teachers and professionals working closely with adolescents fail to perceive adolescent gambling as a high-risk behaviour (Ladouceur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2004</xref>; Graham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>; Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>; Temcheff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>; Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2016</xref>).</p><p>Given the prevalence rates of adolescent gambling and problem gambling in Finland, information on teachers&#x02019; awareness, beliefs and attitudes concerning adolescent gambling and other risk behaviours is needed in order to develop school-based training and prevention materials.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to identify how Finnish middle and high school teachers perceive adolescent gambling issues and other risk behaviours. The four main areas under investigation were: a) teacher awareness of adolescent gambling; b) teacher beliefs and attitudes regarding adolescent gambling and other high-risk activities; c) teacher knowledge of school policies for gambling and other risk behavior and prevention; and d) teachers&#x02019; confidence in their ability to provide services and meet continuing education needs for youth with gambling problems<italic>.</italic> The results of this study will extend and further our understanding of international trends with respect to teachers&#x02019; overall knowledge and perceptions of adolescent risk behaviours, including gambling-related activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants and Procedure</title><p>After obtaining approval from the Ethics Committee of the University of Helsinki, schools were contacted using advertisements via the Association of Finnish Principals in April 2014. Each school&#x02019;s principal decided whether their school participated in the study. The principals in 19 middle and high schools informed teachers about the study, using an information letter (in which the rationale of the survey was explained and teachers were informed that their participation was voluntary, survey responses were anonymous and confidential, and that they could discontinue at any time with no consequences) and allocated time for the teachers to participate in the study. Surveys, and information letters were sent to the schools principals to be distributed. Teachers received written instructions asking them to complete the questionnaire, insert it in an envelope and place it in a sealed box in the teachers&#x02019; lounge. Surveys were completed during teachers&#x02019; meetings or lunch breaks in the teachers&#x02019; lounge, and it took approximately 25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min to complete. One reminder was sent in August 2014 and all completed questionnaires were sent to the researcher (SC). Of the 704 teachers invited to participate, 157 returned completed questionnaire packages (73.9&#x000a0;% women; response rate of 26&#x000a0;%).</p><p>Socio-demographic characteristics of the sample of teachers are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Awareness of Adolescent Gambling</title><p>This study examined a sample of teachers&#x02019; awareness, beliefs and attitudes towards adolescent problem gambling and other risk behaviors among middle and high school students in Finland. Additionally, the teachers&#x02019; knowledge of school policies for gambling and other risk behaviors, their perceptions of their abilities to effectively deal with problem gambling among students was questioned, and their continuing education needs were addressed.</p><p>In general, teachers&#x02019; knowledge regarding the legal age for gambling-related activities was reasonably good but not quite as good as it was for example regarding purchasing alcohol and tobacco. The awareness of the legal age of purchasing gambling products (e.g., scratch cards) or to gamble is not as accurate as their knowledge of other potentially risky behaviours (e.g., purchasing alcohol, cigarettes or driving a car). This result is in line with another Finnish study, which found that enforcement of age limits was more efficient when purchasing alcohol and tobacco than gambling on slot machines (Warpenius et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>).</p><p>Overall, teachers tended to over-estimate the adolescent problem gambling rates. Of importance is that a recent Finnish population study indicates that the increased mandatory age limit (including all games) on has decreased adolescent gambling and problem gambling between 2011 and 2015 (Salonen and Raisamo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). Yet, teachers perceptions about participation rates were somewhat correct and in line with the previous population based studies, varying from between 40 to 60&#x000a0;% depending on age group (Raisamo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>; R&#x000e4;s&#x000e4;nen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2016b</xref>). Our results highlight the same inconsistencies found in both the Canadian (Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>) and Romanian studies (Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>) in that the teachers are to some extent aware of adolescents&#x02019; involvement, in underage gambling and recognize typical characteristics of a problem gambler, but at the same time problem gambling is viewed the least serious adolescent risk behavior. Detection of gambling-related problems are difficult, since the problems do not present as clearly as these with many other addictions (i.e., alcoholism), where the signs are more visible (Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). It may not be due to teachers being unaware of gambling being a risky behavior, but lack of knowledge of how to identify and recognize students with possible gambling problems. Therefore, it is vital that teachers are educated on how to identify students with possible gambling related problems, how they can help with prevention and how to help them or refer them further.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Beliefs and Attitudes Regarding Adolescent Gambling and High-Risk Behaviors</title><p>Of the 14 listed potential problems and concerns, gambling was not perceived by teachers as a very serious issue. The Finnish teachers&#x02019; perceptions about the seriousness of adolescent issues were closer to the Canadian teachers&#x02019; perceptions than the Romanian teachers&#x02019; (Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>; Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). However, Finnish teachers&#x02019; perceptions clearly reflected fewer concerns of any adolescent risk behaviour compared to the Canadian and Romanian teachers. This may likely reflect cross-cultural differences and general attitudes towards both adolescent issues and perceptions of gambling in different countries and a different view of overall responsibility (i.e., state, parents, educators). Overall, public attitudes towards gambling have been more favorable in Finland compared with Great Britain and Australia (Markham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>), and they have shifted even more favorable towards gambling between 2011 and 2015 (Salonen and Raisamo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). Gambling opportunities have increased internationally (&#x000d6;rnberg and Cisneros <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>; Williams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>) and are widely available and accessible in Finland. Games are not only available in casinos, but also in gambling venues such as kiosks, shops, shopping centers, hotels, coffee shops and gas stations, thus resulting in gambling becoming normalized and socially acceptable. Within the Finnish context, characterized by favorable attitudes and easy accessibility to gambling, enhancement of teachers&#x02019; awareness of problem gambling and possible harms related to it at a young and vulnerable age is important.</p><p>Similar to Canadian and Romanian teachers, Finnish teachers were concerned about excessive video game playing and time online (Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>, Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). Excessive video game playing, and more recently social casino gambling has been seen as a possible precursor to gambling and problem gambling. The internet provides new gambling opportunities and may become an attractive environment for adolescent gambling (Dickson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>). Many schools have already implemented &#x02018;safe&#x02019; internet use policies teaching children about privacy issues and cyber bullying (Valcke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2011</xref>). Teachers need to be provided with current information regarding the risks of gambling including internet gambling and the potential negative consequences related to these activities (Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>).</p><p>The teachers believed the ultimate responsibility to prevent adolescents from gambling and excessive problematic gambling lies with parents, which is in-line with previous studies (Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>, Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). Furthermore, in Finland and Canada many teachers reported that the gambling industry had responsibility in gambling prevention for adolescents (Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). Based on population survey among Finns aged 15 to 74, Finnish Gambling 2015, the primary responsibility to prevent gambling problems relies on individuals themselves (45.7&#x000a0;%), the gambling industry (32.3&#x000a0;%) and officials monitoring and treating gambling and gambling problems (20.3&#x000a0;%) (Salonen and Raisamo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Knowledge of School Policies for Gambling and Other Risk Behavior and Prevention</title><p>Teachers were more aware of policies relating to other adolescent high-risk behaviors than those regarding gambling. Finnish teachers&#x02019; knowledge about school policies was lower compared to their international counterparts (Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>, Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). The awareness of formal gambling prevention program was also limited. These findings are reasonable since, currently, there are no national prevention programmes focused on adolescent gambling/problem gambling in Finland. In contrast, smoking and drinking are both well-established adolescent risk behaviours and much effort has been put into prevention programmes for tobacco smoking and alcohol abuse in Finland (Warpenius et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2015</xref>; Huurre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>; Raitasalo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>; Pirskanen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>; Soikkeli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>; Laine and Tossavainen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, public awareness of youth problem gambling is just emerging in Finland compared to preventive initiatives established both in Canada (i.e., International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviours, which provides practical tools and workshops for prevention) (St-Pierre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>; Derevensky and Gilbeau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>; Temcheff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>; Lussier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>, Dickson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2004</xref>) and programs in Romania (Lupu and Lupu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>; Todirita and Lupu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2013</xref>; Lupu and Todirita <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>), that may in turn have been reflected in the Canadian and Romanian teachers&#x02019; perceptions of being more concerned by knowing more about the risks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Confidence in Ability to Provide Services and Continuing Education Needs</title><p>Notwithstanding the limited knowledge about educational resources and awareness of prevention programs for adolescent gambling, some teachers felt prepared to manage students with gambling problems. Many teachers seem to know when to refer a student to the school counselor or when to advise a student to talk to a professional. Given this, it is crucial to also address the issue with the school&#x02019;s health care staff since their knowledge and awareness may be beneficial (Temcheff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>). On the other hand, a recent survey for Finnish health care and social welfare professionals indicates that their basic training does not given them enough knowledge and skills to encounter gambling problems (Castr&#x000e9;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2016</xref>). In general, Finnish teachers&#x02019; reported relatively low interest in receiving any information relating to adolescent gambling, either in a professional training in regard to high-risk behaviours.</p><p>As suggested in earlier studies (e.g., Derevensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>; Sansanwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>), there is a need for school-based prevention programs addressing gambling issues similar to other high-risk behaviours such as violence and bullying issues, substance use, mental health and educational concerns including sexual education. Prevention programs for adolescents often require active participation from schools, especially in Finland, where teachers noted that there is no material available about gambling prevention or were unaware of their existence. It is important to establish policies and practical guidelines similar to those established e.g., for violent behavior, bullying and substance use in Finland. Teachers, particularly in Finland, need to be provided with current information regarding the risks of youth gambling. In Finland it would be possible to arrange in-service training times (teachers have 3 training days per year). Furthermore, strategies from the substance abuse prevention field in Finland could be used as guidelines (i.e., more efforts and initiatives, specifically aimed at schools, are needed to enhance efficacy of preventive youth work and willingness to promote students&#x02019; overall well-being) (Soikkeli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>; Vehmaskoski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2013</xref>; Laine and Tossavainen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>).</p><p>This study is limited due to a convenience sample and relatively low participation rate. Moreover, self-reported survey methodology was used, thus the results could have been subject to participant biases. In addition, as participation was voluntary, the plausibility of self-selection biases exists. Furthermore, it must be acknowledged that cross-cultural comparison is merely descriptive since cultural aspects, such as school systems, curriculums, and teacher&#x02019;s education may affect the different results in different countries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions and Implications</title><p>Adolescent gambling issues are not perceived as important as other well-established adolescent high-risk behaviours, despite the fact that a non-negligible percentage of Finnish adolescents suffer from gambling-related difficulties. Serious attention is needed to prevent vulnerable adolescents from gambling-related harms. Future funding and research should focus on a) increasing public awareness about youth gambling-related issues; b) offering appropriate education and training to teachers about youth gambling issues; c) adopting and implementing preventive school-based programmes; d) advocating to school boards to develop and enforce policies addressing youth gambling issues, and e) evaluating the efficacy of preventive initiatives taken.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Informed Consent</title><p>All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000.
