Pyronaridine has high potency against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, including chloroquine-resistant strains. Studies in various animal models have shown pyronaridine to be effective against strains resistant to other anti-malarials, including chloroquine. Resistance to pyronaridine appears to emerge slowly and is further retarded when pyronaridine is used in combination with other anti-malarials, in particular, artesunate. Pyronaridine toxicity is generally less than that of chloroquine, though evidence of embryotoxicity in rodents suggests use with caution in pregnancy. Clinical pharmacokinetic data for pyronaridine indicates an elimination T<sub>1/2</sub> of 13.2 and 9.6&#x02009;days, respectively, in adults and children with acute uncomplicated falciparum and vivax malaria in artemisinin-combination therapy. Clinical data for mono or combined pyronaridine therapy show excellent anti-malarial effects against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and studies of combination therapy also show promise against <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>. Pyronaridine has been developed as a fixed dose combination therapy, in a 3:1 ratio, with artesunate for the treatment of acute uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria and blood stage <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria with the name of Pyramax&#x000ae; and has received Positive Opinion by European Medicines Agency under the Article 58 procedure.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pyronaridine</kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic></kwd><kwd>Review</kwd><kwd>Artemisinin containing compound</kwd><kwd>Anti-malarial therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Pyronaridine (4-[(7-chloro-2-methoxybenzo<italic>b</italic>[1,5]naphthyridin-10-yl)amino]-2,6-bis[(pyrrolidin-1-yl)methyl]phenol) [Recommended INN: List 59 41: WHO Drug Information, Vol. 22, No. 1, 2008] is a benzonaphthyridine derivative first synthesized in 1970 at the Institute of Chinese Parasitic Disease, Chinese Academy of Preventative Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Pyronaridine also referred to as &#x02018;7351&#x02019; and Malaridine&#x000ae; has been used in China for the treatment of malaria as a single agent for the past 30&#x02009;years.</p><p>More recently, interest has been renewed in pyronaridine as a possible partner for use in artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria treatment. Indeed, its limited use outside China suggests that resistance will be slow to emerge when used in ACT and pyronaridine is currently under investigation as a fixed-dose combination administered in a 3:1 ratio with artesunate for the treatment of uncomplicated <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and blood stage <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria.

Almost all published clinical trials to date used the Chinese enteric-coated tablet formulation with 175&#x02009;mg of the tetraphosphate, equal to 100&#x02009;mg base, with dosages calculated as the free base. The Chinese also developed a capsule formulation available as 100&#x02009;mg and 50&#x02009;mg free base. A capsule fixed-dose formulation of pyronaridine tetraphosphate plus artesunate (3:1 ratio) has been reported by University Sains, Malaysia with pyronaridine dosages based on the tetraphosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. </p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparative activity of pyronaridine against chloroquine-susceptible and -resistant</bold><bold><italic> P. falciparum </italic></bold><bold>field isolates from SE Asia and Africa.</bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1475-2875-11-270-1"/></fig><p>Pyronaridine free base is &#x02018;very sparingly&#x02019; soluble in water, whereas the tetraphosphate salt is &#x02018;sparingly&#x02019; soluble in water (1.46%), aiding oral absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The greater hydrophobicity index (Rm 0.872) of the salt confirms the higher aqueous solubility <italic>versus</italic> the base (Rm 0.773).

The mechanism(s) by which pyronaridine acts as an antimalarial has been examined. Initial studies demonstrated that pyronairidne interfered with the digestive system of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Pyronaridine inhibited &#x003b2;-haematin production with an IC<sub>50</sub> similar to that of chloroquine (0.125 &#x003bc;M) and formed complexes with &#x003b2;-haematin with a 1:2 stoichiometry to enhance haematin-induced human blood cell lysis. 10 &#x003bc;M of pyronaridine was needed for complete lysis, approximately 1/100 of the concentration needed with chloroquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, there was no clear evidence for antagonism between pyronaridine and other anti-malarials that target haematin formation (chloroquine, mefloquine or quinine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

It is noteworthy that both of the &#x02018;positive&#x02019; studies with pyronaridine utilized a bone marrow staining procedure (May Grunwald/Giemsa stain) that would be unable to discriminate between&#x02019;true DNA-containing micronuclei&#x02019;, and potential artefact arising from non-DNA containing granules, such as the RNA-containing granules (&#x02018;Q-bodies&#x02019;) such as has reported in mouse bone marrow after treatment with quinacrine.</p><p>Maier and Schmid reported that quinacrine hydrochloride induced, not micronuclei, but irregularly shaped granular and fibrillar bodies that were negative in the Feulgen reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>].

It was concluded that the apparent increases in micronucleus frequency reported in the earlier studies on pyronaridine were due to the presence of non-DNA containing artefacts on the slides, which had been incorrectly identified as &#x02018;true micronuclei&#x02019; as a consequence of the use of a staining procedure that was not specific for DNA. Furthermore, an <italic>in vivo</italic> COMET assay examining the effects of pyronaridine in the liver and an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay provided no evidence for a direct DNA damaging effect of pyronaridine and were both negative.</p><p>In order to explain the discrepancy between the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data the effects of pyronaridine on topoisomerase II were examined in an inhibition assay and a TARDIS (Trapped in Agarose DNA Immunostaining) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>].

The results indicated that pyronaridine was increasing the number of topoisomerase II molecules complexed with cellular DNA, and that it thus may be acting as a topoisomerase II poison. This could be due to a direct interaction between pyronaridine and topoisomerase II or due to an indirect mechanism such as inhibition of removal/repair of the topoisomerase II complexes on DNA. Clearly this conclusion contrasts with that discussed for the previous study in which purified human topoisomerase II enzyme was used and the absence of linear DNA indicated that pyronaridine was acting as a catalytic inhibitor rather than as a topoisomerase II poison.

In the pyronaridine-artesunate group, 92/228 (40.4%) patients experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event of any cause compared with 72/228 (31.6%) in the chloroquine group. Increased transaminases were more common in the pyronaridine-artesunate group (2.2%) <italic>versus</italic> the chloroquine group (0%). All adverse events in the pyronaridine-artesunate group and the majority (70/72; 97.2%) in the chloroquine group were of mild-to-moderate severity. Adverse events deemed study drug related by the investigator occurred in 27/228 (11.8%) patients in the pyronaridine-artesunate group and 23 (10.1%) in the chloroquine group. There were no deaths during the study. Two patients, both in the pyronaridine-artesunate group, had serious adverse events (one pyrexia, one typhoid fever); neither was considered drug related by the investigator. Two patients, both in the chloroquine group, had adverse events leading to drug discontinuation and study withdrawal (one vomiting plus fatigue, one vomiting); all considered possibly related to drug treatment by the investigator. No clinically meaningful difference in change from baseline in haemoglobin was observed between patients with or without phenotypic G6PD deficiency. Other haematology laboratory findings (increases in platelets, eosinophils, and lymphocytes and a decrease in neutrophils) were of similar magnitude in both treatment groups. Biochemistry laboratory observations were generally similar in both treatment groups, with the exception of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). From Day 3 to the end of the study, 3/228 (1.3%) patients in the pyronaridine-artesunate group had peak ALT&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5x the upper limit of normal (ULN); two (0.9%) with peak ALT&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;ULN. Total bilirubin values were within normal limits for both of these subjects throughout the study. No patients in the chloroquine group had ALT&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5xULN. Post-treatment AST was&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;ULN in one patient in the chloroquine group and&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;ULN in one patient from the pyronaridine-artesunate group; total bilirubin was within normal limits. Values for AST and ALT were close to or within normal limits by Day 28. No patient had peak ALT or AST&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;ULN plus total bilirubin&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;ULN during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Pyronaridine plus artesunate combination: paediatric formulation</title><p>One study, conducted in Gabon, included children aged two to 14&#x02009;years old with the tablet formulation of fixed-dose pyronaridine-artesunate at three different ratios 6:2, 9:3 and 12:4&#x02009;mg/kg or a paediatric granule formulation of fixed-dose pyronaridine-artesunate at 9:3&#x02009;mg/kg; both formulations were given once daily for three days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>]. In this study, between 70% and 90% of patients experienced at least one adverse event, one third of which (20&#x02013;36%) was judged as being at least possibly study drug related (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>). The majority of study drug-related adverse events was observed in the category of gastrointestinal disorders, including patients experiencing vomiting (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), abdominal pain (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), diarrhoea (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), and nausea (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). Other possibly drug-related adverse events were rare. No study drug-associated abnormal electrocardiographic finding occurred in this clinical trial. All adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity and there was no severe or life threatening adverse events or increase in the rate of events based on dose. Two serious adverse events occurred in the lowest dose group (6&#x02009;mg/kg pyronaridine&#x02009;+&#x02009;2&#x02009;mg/kg artesunate) and were not study drug related. In this study there was a modest decrease in median haemoglobin levels in the first 72&#x02009;h of treatment with complete recovery by Day 7. A general rise in platelet count and eosinophils was noted. There were no clinically significant changes in the biochemistry parameters during the course of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Pyronaridine plus artesunate combination: pooled analyses</title><p>In an integrated safety analysis of the pyronaridine-artesunate Phase III studies, 57.2% of pyronaridine-artesunate patients reported at least one adverse event after baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">120</xref>]. Pyronaridine-artesunate and the comparator drugs were well tolerated. Overall, the rate and type of adverse event were generally comparable between the various treatment groups and were of mild or moderate severity. There were no deaths and few SAEs (0.6% in pyronaridine-artesunate patients) and most of them were not related to pyronaridine-artesunate. Overall, no changes in vital signs were observed except for a fall in heart rate immediately after treatment, probably reflecting the clearance of fever. The pattern of changes seen in clinical laboratory parameters was consistent with acute malaria and its resolution after treatment. All biochemistry changes were transient and reversible and not associated with any symptomatology. Pyronaridine-artesunate was not associated with any increased risk of haematologic adverse events.</p><p>The hepatic data were reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) that consisted of six members, including three international experts in Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI). The committee concluded that a three-day treatment with pyronaridine-artesunate can cause transient rises in ALT concentration in a small subset of patients. However, the early onset (Day 3&#x02013;7), dose response trend, and rapid resolution were all consistent with direct low-level toxicity. The IDMC commented that with hepatotoxic drugs, serious idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity typically begins after weeks or months of treatment, like described with amodiaquine, another Mannich base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">126</xref>]. These findings, combined with the fact that pyronaridine-artesunate is given for only three days, suggest that the risk of progressive liver injury to subjects receiving pyronaridine-artesunate is very lowA detailed review of ECGs from patients who received pyronaridine-artesunate was conducted by a single, independent observer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">127</xref>]. ECGs (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,371) were reviewed from eight sites in Asia and Africa in 477 adult patients (15&#x02013;60&#x02009;years, mean age: 28&#x02009;years) and 228 ECGs from one site in Africa in 60 paediatric patients (two-14&#x02009;years, mean age: six years). ECGs were assessed for waveforms (P, QRS and T as well as the presence of U waves), rhythm (abnormal rhythms as well as tachycardia and bradycardia) the evidence of abnormalities of PR, QT, and ST segments and ECG clinically significant abnormality. In the adult study, only 2% of the total number of ECGs were considered clinically significant abnormal, with no evidence of any increased risk of QTc elongation and only 0.13% having a QTc &#x0003e;450&#x02009;msec (all of which were&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;465&#x02009;msec). There were no differences with dose of pyronaridine-artesunate and generally no changes from baseline with the exception of bradycardia (HR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;55&#x02009;bpm), also being the most commonly reported finding; Day 1 (5.2%) and Day 2 (7.5%) with similar frequency between Africa and Asia, being in line with literature reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B128">128</xref>]. In those under 14&#x02009;years treated, the most frequent abnormality reported was sinus arrhythmia, which is commonly reported in children of this age. In summary the use of pyronaridine-artesunate was not associated with either significant ECG changes or increased risk of QTc prolongation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Current status</title><p>Pyronaridine tetraphosphate-artesunate (PYRAMAX&#x000ae;) is being co-developed by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) and Shin Poong Pharm Co Ltd (Republic of Korea) for the treatment of acute uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and blood stage <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria with a fixed-dose combination tablet and granule formulation for paediatric administration. MMV is a not-for-profit organization, operating as a public&#x02212;private partnership seeking to discover, develop and deliver new anti-malarial drugs. A complete suite of toxicology and safety pharmacology studies and a full clinical programme has been undertaken. Pivotal Phase III comparative clinical trials were completed in 2009, to include over 3,000 children, adolescents and adults across sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia in more than 18 countries. Positive Opinion was received by the European Medicines Agency under the Article 58 procedure in March 2012. Shin Poong received approval from the Korean Federal Drug Agency in August 2011 and this will be followed by national regulatory submissions and WHO procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pyronaridine has shown value as a therapeutic partner to use in artemisinin combination therapy. Pyronaridine brings high efficacy, including against chloroquine and amodiaquine-resistant strains, and the reassurance of many years of successful use in China as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-malarials, without the development of widespread drug resistance. To date no serious toxicities have been reported for pyronaridine.. Notably, pyronaridine in combination with artemisinins appears to reduce the development of resistance <italic>in vitro</italic>. Also, studies <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models indicate a synergistic effect between pyronaridine and artemisinins against parasites resistant to one or both components, restoring efficacy against these strains. Consequently, pyronaridine represents an ideal candidate for combination therapy with artemisinin derivatives, such as artesunate. Pyronaridine also appears to be well tolerated in clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">120</xref>]. Clinical studies of the combination of pyronaridine tetraphosphate and artesunate are encouraging and show it to be a promising new artemisinin combination therapy for the treatment of both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and P. <italic>vivax</italic> malaria in adult, children and infant populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B121">121</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACT, Artemisinin-based combination therapy; Bid, Twice daily; ECG, Electrocardiogram; ED50, The amount of material required to produce a specified effect in 50% of a population; IC50 IC90, IC99 dose at which 50, 90 or 99% of parasites are inhibited, Respectively; IG, Intragastric; IM, Intramuscular; IP, Intraperitoneal; IV, Intravenous; LD50, Lethal dose of 50% of test population; MLD, Minimal lethal dose; QD, Once daily; SC, Subcutaneous; ALT, Alanine aminotransferase; AST, Aspartate aminotransferase.; Eq/g Pyronaridine tetraphosphate, 910.03&#x02009;g.mol-1 ; Pyronaridine, 518.05&#x02009;g.mol-1 ; Log D, 1.7 at pH 7.4.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr CS Shin is former Head of Pyramax Development at Shin Poong Pharmaceuticals (retired).
