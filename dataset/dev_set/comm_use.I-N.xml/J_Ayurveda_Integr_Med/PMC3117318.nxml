They continue to do so today and will also play major roles in the future. Systems of medicine considered Indian in origin, or systems of medicine which have come to India from abroad and been assimilated into Indian culture are collectively known as Indian Systems of Medicine (ISM). India has the unique distinction of having six recognized systems of medicine in this category: Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>]</p><p>Among them, Ayurveda has been practiced for thousands of years. Considerable research on the pharmacognosy, chemistry, pharmacology, and clinical therapeutics of Ayurvedic medicinal plants has been carried out. Natural products, including those from plants, animals, and minerals have been the basis of its treatment of disease. The currently dominant system, modern medicine or &#x02018;allopathy&#x02019; has gradually developed and over the years come to be accepted through scientific research and observation. However, the ultimate basis for its development lies in traditional medicine and therapies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>]</p><p>In explaining medicinal plants, <italic>Rigveda</italic> dates them back three yugas prior to the existence of animal life on earth. This indicates the importance it attributed to medicinal plants. Ayurvedic texts, from the <italic>Samhitas</italic> to the <italic>Nighantus</italic>, identify about 2000 species of plants and explain their properties. But India&#x02019;s 4,635 ethnic communities include one million folk healers using an estimated 8000 or more species of medicinal plants. Their rural households have little or no financial means to buy drugs off the shelf for medical care. Such folk medicines are the first response to simple ailments. Their economic and therapeutic potential makes standardization, documentation, and conservation of medicinal plants of vital importance</p><p>Selecting the right scientific and systematic approach to biological evaluation of plant products, based on their use in traditional medicine is the key to ideal development of new drugs from plants. One such plant is Lagenaria siceraria (Molina) standley (LS) (Family: Cucurbitaceae). It is a large, softly pubescent, annular, climbing or trailing herb growing throughout the India.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>]</p><p>The entire plant is recognized to be beneficial in ethnic systems of medicine. The fruit is sweet, diuretic, antipyretic, antibilious, tonic for the liver, vulnerary, and antiperiodic. It can cure blood diseases in persons of pitta constitution; muscular pain and dry cough. In Punjab, the pulp is applied to the soles of the feet of those with &#x0201c;burning feet.&#x0201d; The seeds are fattening, cooling, anthelmintic, and a brain tonic; they can cure cough, fever, scalding urine, and earache; they also reduce inflammation (Unani). Their oil can be applied for headache. The rind of the fruit is good for piles, while its ash is styptic and vulnerary. The root is applied in the treatment of dropsy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>PLANT PROFILE</title><p>LS is also known as <italic>Lagenaria leucantha</italic> Rusby and <italic>Lagenaria vulgaris</italic> Seringe. Its common names include bottle gourd (Eng.); alabu (Sanskrit); lauki or ghia (Hindi); dudhi or tumbadi (Gujarati); sorakkai (Tamil); chorakkaurdu (Malayalam); and ghiya (Urdu). Geographically it occurs throughout India and is now cultivated worldwide. It is generally accepted that LS was indigenous to Africa and that it reached temperate and tropical areas in Asia and the Americas about 10,000 years ago.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>PROPERTIES AND ACTIONS MENTIONED IN AYURVEDA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>]</title><p><italic>Rasa</italic> : <italic>Madhura (sweet)</italic></p><p><italic>Guna</italic> : <italic>Snigdha</italic> (viscous)</p><p><italic>Virya</italic> : <italic>sita</italic> (cool)</p><p><italic>Vipaka</italic> : <italic>Madhura</italic> (pleasant)</p><p><italic>Karma</italic> : <italic>Pittahara, Bhedaka, Hrdya, Vrsya</italic></p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Parts used[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>]</title><p>All parts of the plant including ripe fruits, leaves, stem, and flowers may be used for the treatment of various ailments as described above.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Morphology</title><p>Vigorous annual herb. <italic>Stems</italic> are prostrate or climbing, angular, ribbed, thick, brittle, softly hairy, upto 5 m long, cut stems exude no sap. <italic>Leaves</italic> are simple, up to 400 mm long and 400 mm broad, long petioled, 5-lobed, cordate, pubescent, shortly and softly hairy, broadly egg-, kidney-, or heart-shaped in outline, undivided, angular, or faintly 3&#x02013;7 lobed, lobes rounded, margins shallowly toothed, crushed leaves nonaromatic.

The juice extract was studied for its analgesic effect on acetic acid induced writhing and formalin pain tests in mice. Anti-inflammatory effects were investigated employing acute inflammatory models, i.e., ethyl phenylpropionate induced ear edema, carrageenan- and arachidonic acid induced hind paw edema, and also the albumin-induced paw edema in rats. Extract (150 -300 mg/kg, p.o.) exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of writhing and also showed a significant inhibition of both phases of the formalin pain test, but with a less intense effect on the first phase than on the second. The extract&#x02019;s effects were significantly lower than those produced by morphine (10 mg/kg) and aspirin (300 mg/kg) in the same tests. The extract elicited significant inhibitory effect on ear edema formation at 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h after EPP injection. In other acute inflammatory models, the extract significantly inhibited carrageenan- and arachidonic acid induced hind paw edema. LS juice also caused inhibition of albumin-induced paw edema over a period of 90 min.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Antihyperlipidemic activity</title><p>Antihyperlipidemic activity of the fruit extracts in triton-induced hyperlipidemic rats and hypolipidemic effect in normocholesteremic rats were investigated.

Out of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg of peel extract, 100 mg/kg was found to be safest and most effective, as it could inhibit the levels of serum thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and glucose as well as hepatic LPO. Finally the antithyroidal, antiperoxidative, and glucose inhibitory potential of the peel extract were tested in T4-induced hyperthyroid animals. After 21 days of treatment, reductions in concentrations of serum thyroid hormones, glucose, and hepatic LPO were observed, with parallel increases in antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione, indicating the efficacy of the peel in hyperthyroidism, hyperglycemia, and hepatic LPO.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT26">26</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion|conclusions" id="sec1-7"><title>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</title><p>L. <italic>siceraria</italic> is a well-known plant used in ISM; in addition, folk medicine also claims uses especially in cardiac and hepatic diseases, ulcer, etc. Recently LS fruit has become widely cultivated in India, Sri Lanka, China, and many other countries for its culinary and medicinal uses.
