To build comprehensive life cycle inventories, secondary datasets are commonly used when primary data are not available. However, different inventory data and modelling approaches are used to populate secondary datasets, leading to different results. The present study analyses the features of twelve secondary datasets to support datasets selection and proper interpretation of results. We assess twelve datasets for arable crop production in France, as modelled in three databases often used in the LCA field (Agri-footprint, ecoinvent and AGRIBALYSE). First, we compared system boundaries and general assumptions. Second, we focused on foreground systems comparing, inventory data, data sources and modelling approaches. Third, we performed a contribution analysis of impact assessment results to identify modelling choices that contribute most to differences in the results. Nine relevant elements were identified and assessed: definition of system boundaries and modelling of agricultural practices, characteristics of inventory data, agricultural operations, fertiliser application and fate, plant protection products application and fate, heavy metals inputs to the agricultural system and fate, irrigation assumptions, land use and transformation. The datasets differ greatly with respect to these elements. Hence, recommendations are drawn from the datasets comparison, supporting the selection of the datasets coherently with the goal and scope of a study and interpretation of results.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Life Cycle Assessment</kwd><kwd>Life cycle inventory</kwd><kwd>Agriculture</kwd><kwd>Arable crops</kwd><kwd>Databases</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p id="misc0010">Handling Editor: R.L.

The aim is to identify drivers of environmental impacts associated with food production and possible improvements thereof. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a reference methodology for supply-chain impact assessment (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">ISO, 2006</xref>). However, when the subject of the study is a manufactured product (e.g. a food product), data on agricultural stages of basic ingredients (e.g. wheat) are often not collected directly, relying instead on &#x0201c;secondary data&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Williams et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). This approach helps to streamline estimation of the product's environmental profile (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Teixeira, 2015</xref>), reducing the resources required to collect data and allowing a LCA to be performed when the necessary life cycle inventory data are not available from primary sources of data. The choice of the secondary datasets to be used is considered one of the challenges for a robust LCA study (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Notarnicola et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>) and can influence the results of the LCA study (e.g. <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Peereboom et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>, found out a variation of impact results from 10% to 100% when different datasets were used in a case study on PVC). Indeed, different modelling assumptions in datasets aiming to represent the same product system can lead to different results, affecting the reliability of the LCA study (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Williams et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). LCA practitioners are, therefore, recommended to choose datasets carefully according to the goal and scope of their studies (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Fazio et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">Several authors have already analysed secondary data from different points of view: (i) developing criteria for assessing data quality (e.g. <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Garra&#x000ed;n et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Grabowski et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>), (ii) estimating influence of datasets quality on life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Peereboom et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>), (iii) developing approaches based on a descriptive and statistical analysis to assess reliability of secondary data used in LCA (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Teixeira, 2015</xref>), and (iv) adopting meta-analysis to estimate average values of environmental impacts (e.g. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Achten and Van Acker, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">To our knowledge, however, systematic analysis of secondary datasets modelling arable crops has not been performed to date. Hence, the present study analyses secondary datasets of arable crop production, based on the approach adopted by <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Peereboom et&#x000a0;al. (1998)</xref> with some adaptations for the agricultural context. It aims to understand similarities and differences in datasets of arable crop cultivation and the extent to which the differences may affect LCIA results. We identified and analysed elements in datasets which may influence LCA results the most, as well as strengths and weaknesses of the modelling approaches adopted. Results of the present study could help LCA practitioners to choose secondary datasets which are consistent with the goal and scope of their study and interpret results properly. Furthermore, the results may inform dataset developers about the need for potential improvements to, for example, modelling approaches and underlying assumptions on which datasets were built.</p><p id="p0025">The article is organised as follows: first, system boundaries and underlying assumptions adopted in secondary datasets for arable crops within three databases are reviewed. Second, a summary of the approaches adopted to model the foreground system is supplemented by highlighting similarities and differences among the approaches. Next, the influence that modelling approaches can have on LCIA is illustrated. Finally, conclusions about relevant elements of the datasets are provided.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="p0030">The present study is focused on analysis of secondary datasets for arable crop production as modelled in three of the most commonly used LCA databases: AGRIBALYSE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> v 1.2 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Colomb et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>), Agri-footprint<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> v 1.0 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Blonk Agri-footprint BV, 2014a</xref>) and ecoinvent<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> v 3.1 (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Weidema et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Four arable crops cultivated in France in all three databases were selected for analysis: soft wheat, barley, rapeseed and pea (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Agro-footprint and ecoinvent do not include specific datasets modelling soft wheat production, therefore the dataset for wheat production was considered in the analysis. Futhermore, as AGRIBALYSE includes both spring pea and winter pea, the average of the two was considered in the analysis. The crops and their country of production were selected to obtain the largest number of comparable datasets. Ecoinvent includes: attributional datasets, consequential datasets and datasets based on the so-called &#x0201c;cut-off system model&#x0201d; approach (whose underlying philosophy is that primary production of materials is always allocated to the primary user of a material) (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">ecoinvent, 2016</xref>). Differences in the LCIA results of these three modelling approaches were screened. As few differences were found (supplementary material, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Figs.&#x000a0;S6&#x02013;S9</xref>) and inclusion of consequential and &#x0201c;cut-off&#x0201d; datasets would have rendered the comparison with other databases too complex, only ecoinvent's attributional datasets (the default) were analysed.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Databases assessed in the study., FR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;France, U&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;unit process, S&#x000a0;= system process, Alloc def&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;ecoinvent default allocation.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0045">Table&#x000a0;1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Database</th><th>Dataset</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AGRIBALYSE v 1.2</td><td>Soft wheat grain, conventional, national average, at farm gate/FR U<break/>Barley, conventional, malting quality, national average, at farm gate/FR S<break/>Rapeseed, conventional, 9% moisture, national average, at farm gate/FR U<break/>Winter pea, conventional, 15% moisture, at farm gate/FR U<break/>Spring pea, conventional, 15% moisture, at farm gate/FR U</td></tr><tr><td>Agri-footprint v 1.0</td><td>Wheat grain, at farm/FR<break/>Barley grain, at farm/FR<break/>Rapeseed, at farm/FR<break/>Pea, at farm/FR</td></tr><tr><td>ecoinvent v 3.1</td><td>Wheat grain {FR} | wheat production | Alloc Def, U<break/>Barley grain {FR}| barley production | Alloc Def, U<break/>Rape seed {FR}| production | Alloc Def, U<break/>Protein pea {FR}| production | Alloc Def, U</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0035">Datasets were analysed based on information reported in dataset documentation, data provided in the databases as implemented in the software SimaPro v 8.0.5, and some other relevant publications (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Frischknecht and Rebitzer, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Nemecek et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). We considered a generic representation of an agricultural production system and distinguished foreground and background systems when analysing datasets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). System boundaries and underlying assumptions of each dataset were compared referring to this diagram. The foreground system was examined by describing the assumptions adopted to model it, highlighting similarities and differences among datasets per hectare of cultivated land. For wheat and barley, all inputs and output flows of cropping were allocated to the grain (none to the straw) to allow results to be compared. As with the foreground system analysis, allocation of potential impacts among co-products was removed from the inventories. Furthermore, since Agri-footprint includes datasets modelling the same product with different allocation approaches, a screening of the effect of allocation on LCIA was performed. LCIA was conducted for the three datasets using the ILCD Midpoint v 1.06 characterisation method (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">EC-JRC, 2011</xref>) as implemented in the software SimaPro v. 8.0.5.

AGRIBALYSE and Agri-footprint data were derived from average information for the French context, collected respectively using questionnaires distributed to technical institutes and from available statistics or other specific data (e.g. the literature). In contrast, ecoinvent datasets were built from data collected for a single French region, Barrois, in the GL-Pro project (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nemecek and Baumgartner, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="p0070">Database providers checked the quality of activity data. For AGRIBALYSE and Agri-footprint, the quality check was performed by experts not directly involved in defining the inventory data and quality was analysed at two levels: plausibility of activity data and presence of data gaps or errors in the LCIA and LCA results (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Blonk Agri-footprint BV, 2014a</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Koch and Salou, 2013</xref>). Ecoinvent datasets, instead, were independently reviewed before they were integrated into the ecoinvent database. Data quality was assessed based on the pedigree-matrix approach in AGRIBALYSE and ecoinvent (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Frischknecht and Rebitzer, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Weidema et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), which, by qualitatively assessing data quality indicators, is applicable when only a single mean value for activity data is available (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Frischknecht and Jungbluth, 2007</xref>). The pedigree matrix considers information about the quality of each primary input and output datum in terms of reliability, completeness, temporal correlation, geographical correlation and further technological correlation.</p><p id="p0075">Uncertainty in activity and inventory data cannot be avoided due to variability and stochastic errors in activity data, appropriateness of input and output flows, model uncertainty and the exclusion of important flows (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Frischknecht and Jungbluth, 2007</xref>). Therefore, a basic uncertainty is reported in ecoinvent for &#x0201c;unit process&#x0201d; datasets. In AGRIBALYSE, barley production is reported only as a &#x0201c;system process&#x0201d; with no information about uncertainty. In Agri-footprint, uncertainty is estimated only for certain categories of background data, mainly according to expert knowledge (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Blonk Agri-footprint BV, 2014a</xref>). The lack of information about uncertainty partially influenced analysis of each dataset's foreground.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Analysis of system boundaries and underlying assumptions</title><p id="p0080">System boundaries and the main underlying assumptions adopted to model arable crop production differ somewhat among the three databases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). It is evident that, within a given database, the same modelling approach is adopted for all the arable crops analysed. Furthermore, databases have several similarities in how they model agricultural systems. In particular, AGRIBALYSE background data were taken from ecoinvent v 2.2, which explains some similarities between the two databases.

When choosing a dataset, it is, therefore, recommended to verify that modelling of PPP application follows legislation of the country in question. Regarding the LCIA, PPP emissions influenced freshwater ecotoxicity and, to a lesser extent, human toxicity. However, estimated impacts can be influenced by assumptions about PPP fate and the type of PPP used. Some PPP emissions did not have associated characterisation factors in the ILCD characterisation model, which may have caused toxicity-related impacts to be underestimated. Therefore, since none of the characterisation methods and related models currently available has characterisation factors for all possible emissions of PPPs, LCA practitioners should be aware that the combination of characterisation model and dataset can influence results of toxicity-related impact categories.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.7"><label>4.7</label><title>Heavy metal inputs and environmental fate modelling</title><p id="p0285">Mass balance and fate of HMs is affected by several uncertainties and limitations. For example, in the datasets analysed, uncertainty in HM inputs to the agricultural system and in fate modelling led to misleading negative emissions to the agricultural soil (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Koch and Salou, 2013</xref>) that resulted in negative contributions to human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity impacts. Furthermore, the choice of characterisation model can influence assessment of impacts on human health greatly (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Pizzol et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.8"><label>4.8</label><title>Irrigation modelling</title><p id="p0290">Databases differ in both irrigation volumes and water flows, with different spatially-explicit characterisation factors, which contribute to different LCIA results. In contrast, temporal variability in irrigation is not considered in any of the datasets analysed. Even though <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pfister and Bayer (2014)</xref> highlighted the importance of considering temporal variability when assessing the impact of water stress, databases currently implemented in commonly used LCA software do not report temporally-explicit flows. Therefore, LCA practitioners are recommended to prefer spatially-explicit water flows to assess water resource depletion, while LCA database developers should focus on including temporal variability in water withdrawals in their datasets.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.9"><label>4.9</label><title>Land transformation modelling</title><p id="p0295">The three databases model land transformation differently. In Agri-footprint and AGRIBALYSE, in which average data are considered, land transformation is reported, but different amounts of transformed land are considered. In contrast, ecoinvent excludes net land transformation. Transformation from a discontinuously built urban area to an agricultural one gives a relevant negative contribution to land use impact in AGRIBALYSE. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to land transformation are considered relevant and are included only in Agri-footprint. In addition, impact due to different land management practices are currently difficult to assess.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0300">Datasets from different databases that model the same crop have methodological differences that can lead to significantly different LCIA results. In the present study nine relevant elements of datasets that model arable crop cultivation were analysed to highlight similarities and differences and investigate the extent to which they affect results. The nine elements are data sources, system boundary definition, agricultural practice modelling, agricultural operation modelling, fertiliser application and nutrient fate modelling, PPP application and environmental fate modelling, HM input and environmental fate modelling, irrigation modelling and land transformation modelling.</p><p id="p0305">Results of the present study provide LCA practitioners with&#x000a0;elements they can use to evaluate characteristics of datasets&#x000a0;which they use for modelling (not only the databases analysed here), to choose the most appropriate one depending on the aim and scope of the study, and to interpret results. Furthermore, to a certain extent, they can provide information to database developers to improve dataset quality. For instance, the exclusion of infrastructure, machinery, and production of PPPs and seeds from system boundaries can significantly influence contribution of the background system to nearly all impact categories.</p><p id="p0310">Activity data from which datasets were built differ greatly because datasets rely on different data sources. Since official statistics on arable crop production in France are currently not available for most activity data, it was not possible to identify the most accurate datasets, however, a check of activity data by a pool of experts may yield a higher level of accuracy.</p><p id="p0315">Concerning the LCIA results, the foreground system contributed more to overall impact for most impact categories and nearly all of the datasets analysed. Impacts of the foreground system were associated mainly with field emissions, most of which are estimated with models. Since field emissions are influenced largely by site-specific conditions, including site-specific parameters in the modelling may lead to more accurate estimates.</p><p id="p0320">Although the present study examined only 12 datasets modelling four arable crops, we consider the present work as a basis from which to start analysing and interpreting other datasets of agricultural products. Furthermore, as the study highlighted that much of the LCIA is associated with estimated emissions, we ask other researchers to explore the pertinence of models used to estimate field emissions and to provide more details about the representativeness of and uncertainty in the results.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Achten</surname><given-names>W.M.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Acker</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>EU-average impacts of wheat production: a meta-analysis of life cycle assessments</article-title><source>J.&#x000a0;Ind.
