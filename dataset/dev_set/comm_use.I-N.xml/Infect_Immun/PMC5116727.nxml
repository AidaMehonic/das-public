Cytokines of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) family have been proposed as important in the host response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection through their role in augmenting antibacterial immune responses, although their proinflammatory effect may contribute to lung damage that occurs as a result of chronic infection. We set out to explore the role of IL-17 in the host response to chronic <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection. We used a murine model of chronic pulmonary infection with CF-related strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>. We demonstrate that IL-17 cytokine signaling is essential for mouse survival and prevention of chronic infection at 2 weeks postinoculation using two different <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> strains. Following infection, there was a marked expansion of cells within mediastinal lymph nodes, comprised mainly of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs); &#x0223c;90% of IL-17-producing (IL-17<sup>+</sup>) cells had markers consistent with group 3 ILCs. A smaller percentage of IL-17<sup>+</sup> cells had markers consistent with a B1 phenotype. In lung homogenates harvested 14 days following infection, there was a significant expansion of IL-17<sup>+</sup> cells; about 50% of these were CD3<sup>+</sup>, split equally between CD4<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells, while the CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> IL-17<sup>+</sup> cells were almost exclusively group 3 ILCs. Further experiments with B cell-deficient mice showed that B cell production of IL-17 or natural antibodies did not provide any defense against chronic <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection. Thus, IL-17 rather than antibody is a key element in host defense against chronic pulmonary infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source id="gs1">Medical Research Council (MRC)

This occurs most notably in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchiectasis but is also increasingly recognized in other chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In CF, <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infections are initially intermittent and can be eradicated by intensive antibiotic treatment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Transition to chronic <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> airway infection usually ensues, such that by age 20, 60 to 70% of CF patients are chronically infected (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The continuous presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> in the airways is accompanied by an inexorable decline in respiratory function, leading to premature death or lung transplantation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Thus, this switch from intermittent to chronic infection is a key event in the progression of disease (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Although antibiotics can delay this transition, better therapies aimed at preventing chronic infection could potentially significantly attenuate the rate of decline in lung function in patients affected by CF, as well in other chronic lung diseases in which chronic <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection occurs.</p><p>Little is known of the mechanisms of host defense against chronic <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection. Cytokines of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) family have been suggested as important in protection against <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection. IL-17 in the lung may be important in host defense against <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> through its ability to orchestrate a neutrophil response and by the induction of a variety of innate antimicrobial peptides (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Increased levels of IL-17A (hereinafter referred to as IL-17) are found in sputum and bronchial lavage specimens of patients with CF (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), produced by a variety of cells of the innate and acquired immune system, including T cells of the Th17 lineage (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Other cells known to produce IL-17 include, <italic>inter alia</italic>, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Although such inflammatory responses can contribute to host defense, they also can potentially cause tissue damage, as is well known for <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> infection, where the host inflammatory response can result in significant tissue damage. Proinflammatory actions of IL-17 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection could increase tissue damage through excess neutrophil accumulation and induction of matrix metalloproteinases (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Indeed, the inflammatory changes and subsequent bronchiectasis so typical of CF have been suggested to be driven by IL-17 cytokines. Although one study examined the role of IL-17 in acute infection (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), the specific role of IL-17 in chronic <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection has not been addressed.</p><p>In the work presented here, we have defined the interactions and effector functions of the IL-17 axis in the pathogenesis of chronic pulmonary <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection. Using a murine model, we show that IL-17 signaling is crucial in host defense against chronic <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection, protecting against chronic colonization and death. Despite increased bacterial burdens, mice lacking IL-17 signaling had less weight loss than controls. We identified a diverse range of cellular sources of IL-17 both in draining mediastinal lymph nodes and in lungs following infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Agar bead infection model.</title><p>The infection model was adapted from the protocol described by van Heeckeren and Schluchter (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and modified as described previously (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</named-content>-laden agar beads were prepared the day before inoculation and stored overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, and a different bead preparation was used for each experiment. <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>-laden beads were stored on ice throughout the murine surgery. Following inoculation of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>-laden beads, the inoculum administered was confirmed by homogenization and quantitative bacteriology of a further two aliquots of beads. Sterile agar beads were stored at 4&#x000b0;C and used for several experiments. Sterile agar bead preparations were confirmed to be sterile before and after each use. For experiments using knockout mutants, all animals (knockout mutants and wild-type [WT] controls) were treated with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>-laden beads.

An average inoculum of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/50 &#x003bc;l per mouse was delivered. Animals were closely monitored postoperatively using a disease severity scoring system (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).

We used two different clinical strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> from patients with CF: YH5, a mucoid isolate, and NH57388A (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), a highly mucoid strain of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> that carries a mutation in the <italic>mucA</italic> gene, resulting in alginate overproduction, a common phenotypic change in <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> isolates following chronic infection of the airways in CF patients (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We performed draft whole-genomic sequencing of the YH5 strain and compared its sequence with the published sequences of the type strain, PAO1 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and NH57388A (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Comparison of the whole genomes (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material) shows the typical pattern of strain differences in this species, with blocks of highly conserved sequences interspersed with regions of insertions or deletions; note that a segment of the NH57388 genome is inverted relative to the sequence of PAO1. Of the many differences, a notable one is the disruption in NH57388 of the <italic>mucA</italic> gene (see Fig. S1B), which encodes an anti-sigma factor that is responsible for the mucoid phenotype of this strain (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This gene is retained in PAO1 and YH5. Another significant difference is the loss of some of the genes of the phenazine biosynthesis pathway in YH5 (see Fig. S1C). This pathway is essential for the synthesis of pyocyanin, an important virulence factor for <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). These differences are considered further in Discussion.</p><p>Following transtracheal delivery of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>-laden beads, virtually all animals recovered completely after anesthesia (4 fatalities within 1 h in 300 procedures). YH5-infected animals remained well for the 14-day period of each experiment, with no differences in clinical score between animals that were given <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>-laden beads and those given sterile beads. However, weight loss following bead delivery was significantly greater in mice given the YH5 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>-laden beads than in those receiving sterile beads (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Following NH57388A inoculation, there were various amounts of early mortality (&#x0003c;4 days), between 0 and 40%. Surviving animals remained well. No animals developed bacteremia following pulmonary infection. At 2 weeks following delivery of beads, NH57388A infection resulted in a mean chronicity rate of 43.4% (standard deviation [SD], 23.9%, and range, 11.1 to 71.5%, for results from 5 experiments with 7 to 10 surviving animals/group). The YH5 strain resulted in a mean chronicity rate of 18.82% (SD, 20.54%, and range, 0 to 37.5%, for results from 6 experiments with 7 to 14 surviving animals/group) at 14 days postinoculation.</p><p>As a measure of the inflammatory response following infection, we enumerated neutrophil numbers in BAL fluid samples 2 weeks following infection (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These results showed that animals with viable bacteria within their lungs at 2 weeks following infection had significantly elevated levels of neutrophils within their BAL fluid samples compared to the levels in BAL fluid samples from animals that had received sterile beads or those that had cleared the infection.</p><p>The bacterial colony counts in chronically infected animals at 2 weeks after infection were very similar for NH57388A and YH5 (see Fig. S3a in the supplemental material); lung homogenates from animals receiving sterile beads contained no organisms. A notable feature of NH57388A <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> colonies recovered from the lungs of chronically infected animals was the appearance of many small-colony variants (see Fig. S3b); this is a common phenotypic variant found in clinical <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> isolates and is associated with greater biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance. These small-colony variants were present in over 80% of chronically infected animals and could be seen as early as 4 days after infection. Small-colony variants were not seen following infection with the YH5 strain.</p><p>Use of the GRI-1 strain, recovered from a patient with ventilator-associated pneumonia, resulted in marked hemorrhagic pneumonia with death of the infected animals with 24 h, and thus, this strain was not used further in our animal models of chronic infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>IL-17RA-dependent signaling mediates resistance to chronic infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>.</title><p>We compared the responses to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection between wild-type (WT) animals and mice lacking the IL-17RA receptor chain that mediates IL-17 family actions (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).

Although we found small reductions in blood neutrophil counts between WT and IL-17RA knockout animals before and after infection (data not shown), there was no difference in BAL fluid neutrophil counts between these groups of animals following infection. However, pulmonary neutrophil recruitment may still play a critical role in preventing chronic infection via a very early IL-17-dependent neutrophil influx. In addition, direct IL-17 activation of neutrophils was recently shown to be required for optimal fungal killing (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The protective effect of IL-17 in the pulmonary <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection model could also result from the ability of IL-17 to induce antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins and the S100 proteins; indeed, in ocular infections, human &#x003b2;-defensin 2 plays an important role in host defense against <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In addition, IL-17 induces proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;). The lack of weight loss seen in infected IL-17RA knockout mice may reflect the lack of such inflammatory cytokine production, since these cytokines are associated with loss of body mass (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>We identified a number of different cellular sources that produce IL-17 in this model of infection. In the draining mediastinal lymph nodes following infection, we found a considerable expansion of cells that predominantly had the characteristics of group 3 ILCs. Specifically, given their production of IL-17, these are likely to be lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells. Further characterization using the ILC3 markers CD127 and ROR&#x003b3;t will be required to establish the identity of these cells beyond doubt. ILC3/LTi cells have been implicated in host resistance to extracellular bacteria, chronic inflammation, and tissue repair. Recently, group 3 ILCs have been shown to present antigen and to contribute to the control of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to commensal bacteria (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The expansion of group 3 ILCs in the mediastinal lymph nodes has been described previously in a helminth infection model (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This study found that in mesenteric lymph nodes, the group 3 ILCs migrated in a CCR7-dependent fashion from the intestine. The origin of the group 3 ILCs that migrate to mediastinal lymph nodes is not clear, especially as the lung has a very low number of these cells. The function of these cells in this location is also not clear. Neutrophils are recruited to regional lymph nodes in infection and inflammation. In this location, they potentially fulfill a number of roles, including limiting pathogen escape, modulating subcapsular sinus macrophage numbers, and influencing dendritic cell maturation and antigen presentation (reviewed in reference <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). IL-17 family cytokines released by group 3 ILCs within draining lymph nodes would thus be one mechanism whereby neutrophils could be recruited to this site during an infection. Further work will be required to explore these possibilities.</p><p>We found a small but significant population of B cells that produced IL-17 in the mesenteric lymph nodes following infection. B cell production of IL-17 has been found in a model of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Trypanosoma cruzi</named-content> infection in mice (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Our study suggests that B1 cells are a source of this cytokine. B1 cells are the predominant B cell in pleural and peritoneal compartments and continuously traffic into these areas by a CXCL13-dependent pathway (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Following activation, they migrate to regional lymph nodes and intestinal lamina propria (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The accumulation of IL-17-producing B1 cells in mediastinal lymph nodes following infection reported here may reflect this activation-induced cell trafficking. Immature plasma cells (plasmablasts) may also express CCD19, B220, and CD43 and, thus, may also be the B cells producing IL-17 within the mediastinal lymph nodes described here (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Further work with genetic marking of distinct lineages will be required to identify these cells unequivocally. These mediastinal node cells from <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>-infected animals require further stimulation with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> to expand the population of B1a cells and to produce secretion of IL-17. This migration and subsequent division in response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> is likely produced via Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the Gram-negative organisms, as has been shown previously (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). However, given that mice lacking B cells showed no defect in the incidence of chronic infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>, these B1 cells are dispensable as a source of protective IL-17.</p><p>Within lung parenchyma following infection, IL-17 was produced from CD4<sup>+</sup> cells with properties of Th17 cells, as well as &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells. Both these cell types were increased in the lung following chronic infection. The generation of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>-specific Th17 cells by a pseudomonal vaccine may thus be of importance in providing protection against chronic infection.</p><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> strains used here were both derived from CF patients but showed important differences in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Apart from the known difference in alginate production in the NH57388A strain, genome sequencing revealed multiple genetic differences between this strain and YH5 (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The alginate overproduction in NH57388A is due to a deletion of part of the <italic>mucA</italic> gene, which encodes a MucA anti-sigma factor (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Also of interest is that YH5 has lost the genetic machinery necessary to synthesize pyocyanin. This could account for its relative lack of virulence compared to that of the NH57388A strain in the IL-17RA knockout animals, but further work will be required to determine which of these genetic differences are most important.</p><p>Chronic <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection is a significant problem not only in CF but also in COPD (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) and non-CF bronchiectasis (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Delaying the onset of chronic infection in such patient groups would represent a very valuable therapeutic goal. Antibiotics can delay this progression but cannot prevent this transition. A number of vaccines against <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> have been developed to attempt to prevent chronic infection; as yet, none of these have shown clinical efficacy (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The work described here opens a new perspective on the prevention and treatment of such <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection. Potential therapies based on augmenting IL-17 action&#x02014;through vaccination or otherwise&#x02014;could be of great value in delaying or preventing chronic <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection in chronic lung disease.</p></sec>
