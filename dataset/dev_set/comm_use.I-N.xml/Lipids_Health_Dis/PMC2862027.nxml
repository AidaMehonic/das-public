Myocytes were transferred to a 1 ml chamber (DH-35 culture dish heater, Warner Instruments, USA) containing external solution placed on the stage of an inverted microscope. The chamber was continuously perfused at a rate of 1-2 ml/min with external solution. Electrodes were prepared from borosilicate glass (Clark Instruments, UK) using P-97 micropipette puller with resistances typically between 2 and 4 M&#x003a9; when filled with internal solution. Whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments were performed with MultiClamp 700B amplifier. Whole-cell capacitance and series resistance were compensated by 60-80%. Experiments were performed at 36-37&#x000b0;C. Voltage clamp pulses were generated via an IBM-compatible computer connected to Digidata 1322. Data acquisition and analyses were performed using pCLAMP software. To obtain action potentials, 5 ms depolarizing pulse with 900pA, 1 Hz in current-clamp configuration was applied.

The present study has showed that the rat ventricular myocytes don't have the typical action potential morphology. APDs are the shortest in epicardial ventricular myocytes, and repolarization rapidly appears after depolarization, showing no platform phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The phenomenon of "spike and dome" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] sometimes can be seen, however, this phenomenon does not appear in endocardial ventricular myocytes. Action potential repolarization in endocardial ventricular myocytes is slow, showing relative standard action potential morphology. The action potential morphologies of mid-cardial ventricular myocytes are between epicardial and endocardial ventricular myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but action potential repolarization is still rapid, and has the tendency of platform phase compared with the epicardial ventricular myocytes. The reasons why these alterations appear are that there are regional differences of I<sub>to </sub>in epicardial, mid-cardial and endocardial ventricular myocytes. The I<sub>to </sub>channels are the most abundant in rat epicardial ventricular myocytes and then in mid-cardial and endocardial ventricular myocytes by turns. The I<sub>to </sub>current densities in epicardial, mid-cardial and endocardial ventricular myocytes were different in this study, which further illustrates that I<sub>to </sub>channels of rat ventricular myocytes have regional differences. I<sub>to </sub>channels in epicardial myocytes are extremely abundant, and therefore, I<sub>to </sub>currents are the largest, which makes action potential repolarization rapid, calcium inflow time and APDs short. In contrast, I<sub>to </sub>channels in endocardial myocytes are few or lack, and therefore, APDs prolong. APA, Vmax, and OS are formed mainly by 0 phase depolarization. Because regional differences of I<sub>to </sub>channels do not affect depolarization of ventricular myocytes, and thus, APA, Vmax, and OS don't have significant differences in epicardial, mid-cardial and endocardial myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive but 4-aminopyridine-sensitive I<sub>to </sub>currents play a major role in modulating cardiac electrical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It underlies phase 1 repolarization, and thus, by setting the voltage of the early plateau phase, it influences activation and inactivation of other plateau currents that control repolarization. It has also been reported in several studies that I<sub>to </sub>channels are potentially important targets for both neuromodulatory control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and antiarrhythmic drug actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These currents have been suggested to contribute significantly to the regional electrophysiological heterogeneity within the ventricular wall, a fact considered to be responsible for T-wave polarity. The heterogeneous distribution of I<sub>to </sub>thus appears to be essential in causing the transmural electrical gradients necessary for proper repolarization of cardiac action potentials. It is expected that changes in I<sub>to </sub>distribution and availability can be expressed in the ECG by typical J-wave and T-wave alterations and may lead to cardiac arrhythmias during evolving heart diseases.</p><p>The present study results have showed that there are regional differences of action potentials and I<sub>to </sub>amplitude and morphology of rat epicardial, mid-cardial and endocardial myocytes. Regional differences of action potentials and I<sub>to </sub>should be considered when rats are chosen as the experimental animal. We should try to obtain same regional ventricular myocytes to avoid experiment errors when we perform cellular electrophysiological study. Consequently, in this study, we only chose epicardial myocytes to investigate the effects of DHA on action potentials and I<sub>to</sub>.</p><p>&#x003c9;-3 PUFAs mainly include DHA and EPA. In order to investigate the mechanisms of &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs on anti-arrhythmias and prevention of sudden death, we performed this experiment to study the effects of DHA on action potential and I<sub>to </sub>of rat ventricular myocytes. The reasons that we chose the rats as experimental animal is not only because the rats have many advantages, e.g. cheap, strong vitality, and easily bred, but more important is that there are many similar electrophysiological characteristics of rat and the human being's cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>After DHA at various concentrations was applied, APDs were gradually prolonged and I<sub>to </sub>currents were decreased by degrees with the increase of DHA concentrations. DHA could inhibit I<sub>to </sub>currents, prolong APDs, and extend effective refractory period of myocardial myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The effects of DHA on action potentials and I<sub>to </sub>may be one of its anti-arrhythmia mechanisms.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> clearly showed that DHA could inhibit I<sub>to </sub>currents. However, from the morphologic changes of action potentials in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, we found that the morphologic changes of action potentials mainly appeared in phase 2 and phase 3 with the increase of DHA concentrations. In contrast, action potential phase 1 formed mainly by I<sub>to </sub>current efflux didn't have significant changes. This means DHA may have the effects on other ion currents in addition to I<sub>to </sub>current.</p><p>The present study has some limitations, e.g., we only investigated the effects of DHA on action potentials and I<sub>to </sub>of rat ventricular myocytes. On the other hand, &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs not only include DHA but also EPA, the electrophysiological effects of EPA on rat ventricular myocytes, and DHA on other ion currents such as I<sub>Na</sub>, I<sub>Ca-L</sub>, I<sub>K</sub>, and I<sub>K1 </sub>are still needed to further study. Only we completely explore the anti-arrhythmia mechanisms of &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs, we can apply them correctly in clinical practice to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the present findings obtained by the patch-clamp technique have clearly shown that APDs are prolonged, and I<sub>to </sub>currents are gradually reduced with the increase of DHA concentrations. Effects of DHA on action potentials and I<sub>to </sub>may be one of the important causes of anti-arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XRL, XJY, and WPP designed research and revised the manuscript; RXW, LPS, SXG, and ZYY performed research; RXW wrote the manuscript; RXW and TG analyzed data.
