Here, we found that DHZ suppressed high-fat diet-induced weight gain, lipid accumulation and hyperglycaemia in C57BL/6 mice and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and stimulated glucose uptake in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. DHZ activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling in an AMPK-dependent manner. Inhibiting AMPK or p38 MAPK blocked DHZ-induced glucose uptake. DHZ increased GLUT4 (major transporter for glucose uptake) expression in skeletal muscle. Glucose clearance and insulin-induced glucose uptake increased in DHZ-fed animals, suggesting that DHZ increases systemic insulin sensitivity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, the beneficial health effects of DHZ could possibly be explained by its ability to activate the AMPK pathway in skeletal muscle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>curcumin analogue</kwd><kwd>dehydrozingerone</kwd><kwd>glucose uptake</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Dehydrozingerone (DHZ), isolated from ginger (<italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>), is an unsaturated derivative of the natural product zingerone.

Although curcumin may be useful clinically, it has not yet been approved as a therapeutic agent. The low bioavailability of curcumin may limit its clinical potential. DHZ is a half analogue of curcumin, representing half of its chemical structure. Numerous studies have suggested that curcumin analogues are promising phytochemicals for the treatment of metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. However, only a few studies have investigated the effects of curcumin analogues in metabolic diseases.</p><p>We investigated the effects of DHZ on metabolic profiles to characterize its metabolic effects.

Co-treatment with DHZ potentiated insulin-induced glucose uptake (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7A</xref>), suggesting that DHZ has an insulin sensitizing effect. If DHZ mediates beneficial effects on HFD-induced metabolic changes, increased activation of AMPK would lead to enhanced glucose clearance. To test this possibility, we performed an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test in experimental animals using a 20% sucrose solution (2&#x000a0;g/kg). Blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower at 30 and 60&#x000a0;min. after glucose challenge in HFD + DHZ-fed mice than in HFD-fed mice, suggesting that DHZ-stimulated AMPK activation accelerated the clearance of blood glucose (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7B</xref>). Next, we analysed tissues from skeletal muscle and liver. In skeletal muscles, most of the tested genes were not affected by either high-fat feeding or DHZ treatment (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7C</xref>). One gene, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), increased in high-fat feeding and further increased by DHZ treatment. This result indicates that DHZ may affect HSL <italic>via</italic> DHZ-mediated hormonal changes. In liver tissues, up-regulation of two gluconeogenic genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), was blocked by DHZ administration in high-fat feeding animal. The mRNA of fetuin, a marker of insulin resistance, was attenuated by DHZ (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7D</xref>).

These findings suggest that the hypoglycaemic effects of curcumin are attributable to metabolic activity similar to that exerted by DHZ in skeletal muscles. The weight-lowering effect of DHZ was shown in normal feeding animal as well as high-fat feeding animal, probably because of its AMPK activation effect in tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipocytes.</p><p>Curcumin regulates glucose homoeostasis in skeletal muscle <italic>via</italic> multiple mechanisms. A hypoglycaemic role for curcumin has been reported in a streptozocin-induced diabetic animal model <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. In addition, we previously reported that curcumin stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Nevertheless, in spite of its clinical potential, curcumin has not yet been used as a therapeutic agent; this is predominantly because of poor water solubility <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and low bioavailability <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> because of modest absorption. For example, negligible amounts of curcumin have been detected in the blood after oral administration of 1&#x000a0;g/kg curcumin <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Bioavailability can also be decreased by metabolism. One study showed that 99% of curcumin in plasma existed as glucuronide conjugates <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Several methods such as the use of adjuvants, nanoparticles and liposomes, have been suggested to overcome these limitations. The chemical structure of curcumin plays a critical role in its biological activity, and therefore structural modifications such as the use of analogues may enhance its solubility and bioavailability. In this study, we demonstrated that DHZ increased the phosphorylation of AMPK in skeletal muscle. Collectively, these findings suggest that a novel structural motif exists in curcumin structural analogues and that DHZ represents the primary motif that exerts effects on glucose metabolism. Liver is another organ for glucose regulation. In our data, DHZ treatment blocked the high-fat feeding induced change in gluconeogenic genes, such as G6Pase, PEPCK and insulin resistance marker, fetuin. These gluconeogenic genes and insulin resistance gene are induced in high-fat feeding animals, but dramatically suppressed by DHA co-treatment, indicating that metabolic roles of DHZ in liver may also contribute to phenotype changes of animal after DHZ administration.</p><p>It was recently reported that DHZ, a half analogue of curcumin, exhibits anti-oxidant, anti-tumour and lipid-peroxidation activities. Although only a few comparative studies have been performed on the effects of curcumin and DHZ on these parameters, structural variations may lead to changes in physiological activity. One study showed that the anti-oxidant effects of curcumin were more potent than those of DHZ. Curcumin has a number of molecular targets. However, because we did not compare their metabolic roles in skeletal muscle, we cannot rule out the possibility that DHZ was more effective at regulating glucose than curcumin. In the future, more extensive structure-function relationship studies should be performed. Another way to increase clinical utility is to develop structural analogues of DHZ, which may alter its pharmacokinetics to make it more easily absorbable in the intestine or more readily metabolizable to a more stable form. Curcuminoids are known to be poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized <italic>in vivo</italic>. Curcuminoids undergo successive reduction to its metabolites in the liver by phase I metabolism, and also extensively conjugated with glucuronic acid by phase II metabolism. In case of curcumin, 65&#x02013;85% of administrated doses was excreted unchanged in the faeces <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. One article showed that DHZ had similar brain uptake ability, but had lower accumulation in the liver, spleen and lungs <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. This result indicated that the instability of curcuminoids <italic>in vivo</italic> should not be ignored to evaluate its clinical usefulness.</p><p>Sulphonylureas and biguanides are drugs used to treat hyperglycaemia, but their use is limited by their accompanying side effects on the kidneys <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and heart <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Insulin therapy also does not guarantee a permanent normal pattern of glucose homoeostasis. Medicinal plants provide the advantage of exerting little or no side effects. To date, metformin, which originated from the plant <italic>Galega officialis</italic>, is the only plant-based drug approved for the treatment of diabetes. However, many medicinal plants might be useful sources for the development of potential diabetes drugs. In the field of diabetes, curcumin and its related analogues are increasingly recognized as potential novel therapeutics. In this study, we found that DHZ-stimulated glucose uptake <italic>via</italic> AMPK activation in skeletal muscle. The activation of p38 MAPK may also recruit specific signalling molecules for glucose uptake <italic>via</italic> AMPK activation. <italic>In vivo</italic>, DHZ blocked HFD-induced weight gain and increased blood glucose. In our data, DHZ activated AMPK-p38MAPK pathway in skeletal muscle cells and also exerted its benign roles in glucose homoeostasis. The association between p38 MAPK and glucose uptake was demonstrated in several articles <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, indicating that p38 MAPK activation in skeletal muscle cells might lead to benign effect in glucose regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, some reports showed that p38MAPK caused brown adipocyte differentiation <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and was involved in thermogenesis <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. These facts supported the notion that the activation of p38MAPK <italic>in vitro</italic> partially correlated with the bodyweight reduction in mice fed with DHZ. These findings provide a greater understanding of the hypoglycaemic functions of DHZ in skeletal muscle cells and suggest that it is a promising agent for the treatment of
