HepG2 cells transfection with HCV allows for viral replication. However, the replication is weak presumably because of HepG2 lack of miRNA-122, which is essential for viral replication. Other agents such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) have been shown to increase the efficiency of infection with other viruses. This study included comparison of HCV genotype 4 5&#x02032;UTR and core RNA levels and HCV core protein expression at different time intervals in the absence or presence of PEG and/or DMSO postinfection.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>We used serum with native HCV particles in infecting HepG2 cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. HCV replication was assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for detection of HCV RNA and immunofluorescence and flow cytometry for detection of HCV core protein.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>HCV 5&#x02032;UTR and core RNA expression was evident at different time intervals after viral infection, especially after cells were treated with PEG. HCV core protein was also evident at different time intervals using both immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. PEG, not DMSO, has increased the HCV core protein expression in the treated cells, similar to its effect on viral RNA expression.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These expression profiles suggest that the current model of cultured HepG2 cells allows the study of HCV genotype 4 replication and different stages of the viral life cycle.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dimethyl sulfoxide</kwd><kwd>hepatitis C virus</kwd><kwd>hepatitis C virus core</kwd><kwd>hepatitis C virus 5&#x02032;UTR</kwd><kwd>HepG2</kwd><kwd>polyethylene glycol</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most common viruses that infects the lives of more than 170 million people worldwide and is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] HCV is a member of the family <italic>Flaviridea</italic>, genus <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> that was discovered in 1989.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] HCV genome is a linear, single stranded RNA of positive polarity, approximately 9.6 kb, which contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids (aa). HCV is classified into at least six major genotypes that in turn are subdivided into sets of subtypes representing all the HCV isolates distributed all over the world. HCV genotype 4 has been identified as the principal genotype among infected individuals from the Middle East and North Africa, particularly Egypt.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] HCV replication takes place in the cytoplasm, and the encoded polyprotein is localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is cleaved into 10 structural (C, E1, E2, and P7) and nonstructural (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) proteins.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] These proteins play important roles in virus replication, assembly, and pathogenesis. HCV core protein is a structural protein of the nucleocapsid that can affect apoptosis, lipid metabolism, transcription, host cell transformation, and immune response of the infected host.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Core protein exists in three forms; 21 kDa, 19 kDa, and 16 kDa.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The genome sequence coding for the core protein is highly conserved within the different HCV genotypes.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Core protein interacts with LT&#x003b2;R, TNF, and Fas. These interactions influence the efficacy of the host antiviral immune responses, which play an important role in the development of chronic infection and in the changes of host cell sensitivity to apoptosis.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The lack of a reliable cell culture system continues to allow the persistent propagation of the <italic>in vitro</italic> virus and hinders the screening of antiviral strategies. Some cell lines, particularly of lymphoid origin, are susceptible to HCV infection and permissive for HCV RNA replication.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Although virus production has been achieved by long-term culture of primary hepatocytes of infected patients,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] efforts to propagate the virus by infection of adherent cells such as hepatoma cell lines have been discouraging because of poor yield and expression. Transfection of HepG2 cells with HCV stably replicate virus and promote both growth and tumor genesis.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, HepG2 lacks miR-122, an miRNA that is important for HCV RNA replication,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the cells weakly support HCV replication.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) have been shown to increase the efficiency of infection with other viruses such as hepatitis B virus,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Sendai virus,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and mouse hepatitis virus.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we examined the effect of PEG and/or DMSO on HCV gene expression and replication.

One forward primer was used in separate reactions with one of the three different reverse primers to produce 326 bp fragments. These primer sets were tested and the products were genotyped by sequencing. 500 ng of viral RNA per reaction. Amplification conditions for HCV 5&#x02032;UTR amplification were as follows: 50&#x000b0;C for 30 min; 94&#x000b0;C for 15 min; 40 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 63&#x000b0;C for 1 min, and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min; and 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min.

The multiple HCV genotypes are characterized by variable geographic distribution and different modes of transmission.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The most common HCV infections all over the world to worldwide are caused by subtypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3a; however, infection in some restricted geographic areas is caused by specific HCV strains, including HCV-4a in Egypt, 5a in South Africa, and 6a in Southeast Asia.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Most HCV researches have been conducted on strains or genomes of genotypes 1 or 2 in Europe, Americas, and Far East.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In this study, we used serum samples obtained from Saudi patients with chronic HCV to examine the infectivity and replication of HCV-4a in hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Comparison of nucleotide sequence of HCV genotypes has revealed significant genetic heterogeneity of the HCV genome. HCV 5&#x02032;UTR region, which consists of 341 bp, is known to be the most conserved region of HCV RNA in terms of primary sequence and secondary structures.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] HCV core region contains 573 bp and is very useful for the differentiation of subtypes because it is more variable than 5&#x02032;UTR region. A meta-analysis study for HCV genotyping, based on 5&#x02032;UTR and core regions alignment, revealed that the rate of conservation in 5&#x02032;UTR region is the highest compared with other regions; 99.2% in genotype 1, 98.9% in genotype 2, 98.6% in genotypes 3 and 4, and 99.5% in genotypes 5 and 6. The HCV core region showed conservation rate of 98.7% in genotype 1, 98.1% genotype 2, 99.7% genotype 3, 98.5% genotype 5, and 99.4% genotype 6. HCV genotype 4 has the lowest conservation rate of 93.2%.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] This is in agreement with our results with 2% nucleotide variation in the 5&#x02032;UTR region and the higher variation rate of 16.5% in the HCV core regions.</p><p>Although HCV molecular biology has progressed rapidly, our understanding of viral replication and pathogenicity is still hindered by the lack of efficient cell culture systems. To achieve a reliable <italic>in vitro</italic> system, we need to obtain a biological status wherein the virus&#x02013;host interactions mimic exactly what happens naturally <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previous studies showed that primary hepatocytes are the most suitable <italic>in vitro</italic> model for biotransformation in the human liver as well as their ability to identify compounds that are potentially toxic to humans.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The difficulty of obtaining human liver material and the absence of the proliferation process shortens the usage of primary hepatocytes for the long-term expression of viral hepatitis. HepG2 cell line, which is derived from a human hepatoblastoma, was considered to be a suitable model for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] HepG2 cells express liver-specific metabolic proteins such as the canaliculi marker MRP2 (multidrug-resistant protein -2) and Bsep (bile salt export protein). These cells form polarized cell membranes over time in culture consistent with the development of apical lumens that constitute the apical bile canaliculi.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] There is also a great similarity in biosynthetic pathways between primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>HCV infects hepatocytes through four cellular receptor molecules. These are CD81, scavenger receptor class B member I (SR-BI), and the tight junction proteins Claudin-1 and Occludin.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Naive HepG2 cells do not express CD81; however, complementation with exogenous CD81 induces susceptibility to HCV infection.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In the current study, the use of infectious viral particles containing intact RNA genome could guarantee the presence of the necessary elements involved in translation of polyprotein precursor and viral replication.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] We utilized infectious serum with native viral particles presumably containing the full-length viral RNA genome in infecting HepG2 cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Both 5&#x02032;UTR and 3'UTR untranslated regions of HCV RNA genome play an essential role in translation of viral proteins via interaction with cellular factors including eukaryotic initiation factor 3 eIF3,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] 40S ribosomal subunit,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and poly pyrimidine tract binding (PTB) protein.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] The same importance holds true for HCV core protein as it has pleiotropic functions. It is a structural protein of HCV nucleocapsid that has the capability of influencing the apoptosis, lipid metabolism, transcription, host cell transformation, and immune response of the infected host.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Also the genome sequence coding for this protein is highly conserved even within the different HCV genotypes.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The core protein predominantly localizes within the cytoplasm of infected hepatocytes and often shows a punctated granular distribution within the cells.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] It has been observed that the majority of the core is located at the ER membrane,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] on the surface of lipid droplets,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and on mitochondrial and mitochondrial-associated membranes.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>To mimic the conditions under which HCV replicates <italic>in vivo</italic>, HCV should infect highly differentiated undivided human hepatocytes. To fulfill these conditions, DMSO and PEG were used as enhancement factors of HCV replication in different cell lines.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] DMSO has been shown to affect cell membrane integrity,[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] alter intracellular signaling processes (eg, protein kinase C activity and integrin expression),[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and affect cellular alternative splicing,[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] all of which may contribute to its potential to promote cell differentiation and alter cell proliferation.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Previous studies showed that the human hepatoblastoma cell line, HUH-7 cells, undergo cytological differentiation when treated with 1% DMSO.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] DMSO-treated Huh7 cell culture system has the capacity to maintain individual cultures for extended periods of time without splitting.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] PEG is known to be a membrane-fusing agent[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and increases the efficiency of infections in a number of virus systems and cell lines[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] by fusing viral and cellular membranes and therefore increasing penetration rates. It was also found to favor virus&#x02013;liposome fusion.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] Thus the general mechanisms of virus&#x02013;cell membrane fusion as well as cell&#x02013;cell communication during the initiation of infection could be the cause of enhanced virus propagation during HCV <italic>in vitro</italic> infections supplemented with PEG.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Addition of PEG to the primary hepatocyte cultures maintained in the presence of 20 g/L DMSO markedly increases the infection of HBV[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but not HCV.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, we tested the susceptibility of HepG2 cell line to HCV infection and established a cell model that could support HCV long-term replication <italic>in vitro</italic>. The expression of viral RNA (5&#x02032;UTR and core) and viral protein (core) in infected cells suggests that this cellular model allows study of HCV life cycle. Our results indicate that expression of HCV genotype 4 viral RNA and protein was possible in HepG2 cells with or without treatment with DMSO and PEG. HCV 5&#x02032;UTR and core RNA were expressed at different time intervals, but RNA expression was enhanced specifically when the cells were treated with PEG. Using immune florescence and flow cytometry the HCV core protein expression was also established in this <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture model. Treating HepG2 cells with DMSO and/or PEG showed similar effects such as RNA expression where PEG gave better HCV core protein expression than other settings.</p><p>HCV replication is determined by RT-PCR to detect HCV RNA levels that are indicative of virus replication.[<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] This method proved useful in detecting low levels of HCV RNA; however, it also presented new challenges including the potential for random priming by cellular nucleic acids, contamination of RNA samples, and the lack of strand specificity due to RNA self-priming.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] HCV replication was reported in nontransformed human fetal hepatocytes, which maintained and secreted HCV particles for 2 months after transfection.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] As the previous study showed[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] that DMSO had no effect on short-term expression of viral genes in infected HepG2 cells, where HCV RNA was detected only at the 9<sup>th</sup> day postinfection, in agreement with our results as HCV RNA amplification showed remarkable increase in HCV replication when cells were treated with PEG, in contrast to those treated with DMSO alone or combined with PEG.</p><p>From previous studies, flow cytometric analysis showed that HCV core protein was detected in infected HepG2 cells after 24 h (5.7%) and protein expression increased after 3 days (13.5%).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Our findings indicated higher expression levels of HCV core protein in HepG2 cells with 22.9% of the cells at 2 days postinfection and 30% at 4 days were positive for HCV core protein. Since detectable HCV structural proteins in cells after infection may represent the residue of the inoculated virus after releasing the viral genome to cytoplasm, it is necessary to demonstrate that HCV structural proteins detected in the infected cultures are newly synthesized rather than residuals of viral inoculum. The observed increase in core expression reflects part of de novo synthesized structural viral proteins.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Similarly, in our study, flow cytometric results of HCV core protein became evident at day 4 postinfection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We report an <italic>in vitro</italic> system of cultured HepG2 cells infected with HCV genotype 4.
