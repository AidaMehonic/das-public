However, it is not clear what causes progesterone resistance in endometriosis. This study aimed to assess whether cytokines or peritoneal fluid can affect progesterone receptor (PR) expression in endometrial cells and to verify whether PR expression is reduced in endometriosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The PR-B/A ratio was measured via real-time polymerase chain reaction after <italic>in vitro</italic> culture, in which endometrial cells were treated with either tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukin-1 beta, or peritoneal fluid obtained from women with advanced-stage endometriosis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to compare PR-B expression between eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues from women with and without advanced-stage endometriosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The PR-B/A ratio was significantly decreased by treatment with either TNF-&#x003b1; (<italic>p</italic>=0.011) or peritoneal fluid from women with advanced-stage endometriosis (<italic>p</italic>=0.027). Immunoreactivity of PR-B expression was significantly lower during the secretory phase than during the proliferative phase in endometrial tissues from control subjects (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). PR-B expression was significantly reduced in the eutopic endometrium (<italic>p</italic>=0.031) and ovarian endometrioma (<italic>p</italic>=0.036) from women with advanced-stage endometriosis compared with eutopic endometrium tissues from control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Progesterone resistance in endometriosis may be caused by proinflammatory conditions in the pelvic peritoneal microenvironment.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Endometriosis</kwd><kwd>endometrium</kwd><kwd>progesterone receptor</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd><kwd>peritoneal fluid</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source country="KR"><institution-wrap><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="CrossRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source country="KR"><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="CrossRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002701</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013R1A1A2008247</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Endometriosis is a chronic disease that is characterized by endometrial cell proliferation outside of the uterine cavity, and this condition occurs in 6&#x02013;10% of reproductive-age women and in 50% of infertile women.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although the mechanisms responsible for its pathogenesis and progression remain the subject of debate, endometriosis is widely accepted to be an estrogendependent chronic inflammatory disease.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Indeed, medical treatment regimens that suppress estrogen levels have been effective in reducing pain and the size of the lesions, although definite treatment is not yet possible.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Additionally, many studies have proposed that proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role in the complex inflammatory cascade that is associated with endometriosis.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Progesterone, a hormone that facilitates endometrial maturation for implantation, acts through the intracellular progesterone receptors (PRs). Several previous studies have suggested that a failure of progesterone to appropriately regulate gene expression during endometrial differentiation might be a critical component of the pathogenesis and/or pathophysiology of the disease.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Kao, et al.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> showed that a group of target genes in the eutopic endometrium are normally downregulated during the window of implantation yet are significantly increased in women with endometriosis, suggesting that progesterone may mediate the expression of critical genes that could be altered in the eutopic endometrium of endometriosis patients. Specifically, Bulun, et al.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> suggested that the molecular basis of progesterone resistance in endometriosis might be associated with an overall reduction in the expression levels of PRs and the absence of PR-B, the PR isoform.</p><p>However, there have been few studies suggesting possible factors that can lead to a decreased expression of PR in endometrial cells or tissues in women with endometriosis, and it remains to be elucidated what might be the cause of progesterone resistance in endometriosis. We designed the present study for two purposes. First, we aimed to see whether proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&#x003b2;) or peritoneal fluids obtained from women with advanced-stage endometriosis have any discernible effect on PR expression in endometrial cells. Second, we aimed to verify whether the expression of PR-B is decreased in the eutopic endometrium and ovarian endometrioma of women with advanced-stage endometriosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients and tissue collection</title><p>For endometrial stromal cell (ESC) cultures, endometrial samples were obtained from fertile women who were diagnosed with intramural leiomyoma at the time of hysterectomy, had no evidence of endometrial abnormalities, adenomyosis, or pelvic endometriosis, and had not taken any hormonal medication in the preceding 3 months. The endometrial samples were placed in Hank's balanced salt solution and transported to the laboratory for ESC isolation and culture. Peritoneal fluids were obtained from a total of five patients in whom advanced-stage endometriosis had been confirmed via laparoscopy before any surgical manipulation during the proliferative phase. Peritoneal fluids were centrifuged and stored at -80&#x02103; until <italic>in vitro</italic> treatments. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient using consent forms and protocols approved by the Review Board for Human Research of Asan Medical Center.</p><p>For immunohistochemical staining, endometrial sections were obtained from a total of 32 women with carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (CIS) of the uterine cervix as well as a total of 39 women with histological evidence of endometriosis. All of the recruited women had regular menstrual cycles and had undergone hysterectomies via either transabdominal or laparoscopic methods. Women with an endometrial abnormality, adenomyosis, or pelvic endometriosis were excluded from the control group, and all of the women in the endometriosis group were surgically confirmed as having advanced-stage endometriosis. In the endometriosis group, the extent of disease was staged according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine criteria.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The date of the menstrual cycle was classified as proliferative (days 1&#x02013;13), early-secretory (days 14&#x02013;19), mid-secretory (days 20&#x02013;23), or late-secretory (days 24&#x02013;28) phase via endometrial histology using the criteria of Noyes, et al.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Sections of endometrioma were also obtained from 28 nulliparous women in whom ovarian cystectomy was performed due to ovarian endometrioma. The clinical characteristics, the menstrual phases of each group, and the stages of endometriosis are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

However, there was no difference in PR-B expression in the stromal cells between the two groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We previously reported that the expression levels of p21-activated kinase (Pak)-1 and Pak-4, which have been shown to be involved in cancer development and progression, are increased in the eutopic endometrium as well as in ovarian endometrioma in women with advanced-stage endometriosis.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In those previous studies, we found that the expression levels of Pak-1 and Pak-4 are downregulated by <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment of progesterone in normal endometrial cells. Moreover, the immunoreactivities of both kinases are also reduced during the secretory phase when the serum progesterone level is elevated in normal endometrium of women without endometriosis. We suggested that resistance against the activities of progesterone may cause persistently high expression of Pak-1 and Pak-4 in eutopic endometrium as well as ovarian endometrioma in patients with endometriosis. Based on the findings that <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment of endometrial cells with proinflammatory cytokines resulted in increased expression of Pak-1 and Pak-4, we also proposed that the peritoneal proinflammatory microenvironment due to presence of endometrioma may drive progesterone resistance in these patients.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that the PR-B/A ratio is significantly decreased by treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; and peritoneal fluid obtained from women with advanced-stage endometriosis. These findings suggest that the progesterone resistance that occurs in women with endometriosis may be a consequence of the proinflammatory peritoneal microenvironment due to the presence of endometrioma in the pelvic cavity. When considered along with our previous studies,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> the increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines may cause a decreased PR-B/A ratio, which might in turn result in the activation of other signaling pathways to facilitate the development and progression of endometriosis as a consequence of less responsiveness to progesterone, which would normally inhibit those pathways. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate whether additional critical factors exist that would cause progesterone resistance in patients with endometriosis. Indeed, crosstalk between PR and the AKT signaling pathway has been suggested, and it has been shown that AKT is sufficient to downregulate the PR protein expression level.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Regarding the level of PR expression in endometriosis, inconsistent data have been reported by several investigators. Attia, et al.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> found that the PR-B protein is not detectable in endometriotic tissue, whereas other studies have suggested that the level of PR expression may be unpredictable or increased in endometriosis.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Utilizing immunohistochemistry, we found that the immunoreactivity of PR-B was obviously decreased in the eutopic endometrium and ovarian endometrioma of women with advanced-stage endometriosis compared to the controls, which seems to be quite consistent with the data of Bulun, et al.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and Attia, et al.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>There were several limitations in the present study. As the level of PR-B expression was not consistently assessed via Western blot analysis in an endometrial cell culture model, we were only able to compare the PR-B/A ratio using real-time PCR, similar to a previous study on PR expression level.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We could not use endometrial tissues of absolutely disease-free controls; thus, we recruited women with CIS of the uterine cervix as controls. Despite these limitations, the present study showed for the first time that the PR-B/A ratio was significantly reduced after treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; or peritoneal fluid obtained from women with advanced-stage endometriosis. This study also verified the reduced expressions of PR-B in the eutopic endometrium and ovarian endometrioma of women with advancedstage endometriosis. These findings strongly suggest that progesterone resistance in endometriosis may be induced by proinflammatory conditions in the pelvic peritoneal microenvironment. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the detailed signaling pathways including nuclear factor kappa-B activation, in which proinflammatory stimuli drive progesterone resistance through multiple steps in endometrial cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of
