Patient was treated for pulmonary tuberculosis 4 years ago. She was a non-smoker. There was no significant family history. Her chest X-ray showed right middle lobe collapse and consolidation with a mass in the right paracardiac region. CT thorax revealed a mass in the right middle lobe (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="OMV012F1">1</xref>a and b). Subsequent bronchoscopy showed a growth completely occluding the right middle lobe bronchus and extending proximally into the bronchus intermedius. Bronchoscopic biopsy was suggestive of myoepithelioma. A second opinion also raised the possibility of neuroendocrine tumour.

In view of this, right-sided bilobectomy (middle and lower lobe) with mediastinal lymphadenectomy was performed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="OMV012F2">2</xref>). Histopathology revealed a tumour composed of cells arranged in lobules, sheets and focal glandular pattern separated by fibrocollagenous stroma (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="OMV012F3">3</xref>). The tumour cells showed bland vesicular oval nuclei with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Few of the tumour cells were mucin secreting. The lymph nodes, a total of 27 in all, exhibited only reactive changes.

Its origin was first described in 1952 by Smetana and Liebow [<xref rid="OMV012C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It accounts for &#x0003c;1% of all lung tumours [<xref rid="OMV012C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This tumour has been reported to occur in relatively young persons. There appears to be no association with cigarette smoking or other risk factors for bronchial carcinoma such as asbestos exposure [<xref rid="OMV012C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Our patient was a 38-year-old female, non-smoker.</p><p>MEC generally occurs in the central bronchial region. In our patient, the tumour was arising from middle lobe bronchus. The common clinical symptoms and signs include cough, haemoptysis, bronchitis, wheezing, fever, chest pain and rarely clubbing of the fingers [<xref rid="OMV012C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Histologically these tumours are similar to those originally described in the major salivary glands and are believed to originate from the minor salivary glands lining the tracheobronchial tree [<xref rid="OMV012C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Grossly, the tumour size at diagnosis ranges from 0.5 to 6 cm with an average size of &#x0223c;2.2 cm in the reported literature. They are soft, polypoid and pink-tan in colour, often with cystic changes and a glistening mucoid appearance [<xref rid="OMV012C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>On the basis of morphological and cytological features, tumours are divided into low and high-grade types. Low-grade tumours are dominated by cystic changes and solid areas typically comprising of small glands, tubules and cysts of mucin secreting and columnar epithelial cells with infrequent mitotic activity. Often non-keratinizing squamoid cells are also seen in a sheet-like pattern with intercellular bridges. High-grade MEC is very rare and show a predominance of intermediate and squamoid cells predominate with a minor component of mucin secreting elements. They demonstrate nuclear atypia with brisk mitotic activity and a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio [<xref rid="OMV012C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The clinical picture of MEC is similar to that of asthma, COPD or pneumonia. Hence one should keep in mind of this rare entity in patients who are unresponsive to regular treatment. Low-grade MEC has a much better prognosis than high-grade tumour, the latter being similar to non-small-cell carcinoma [<xref rid="OMV012C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Radical surgery similar to lung cancer treatment is performed for MEC. Patients with low-grade MEC have a good prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 95% and adjuvant treatment is unnecessary.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>None declared.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="OMV012C1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yousem</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hochholzer</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mucoepidermoid tumours of the lung</article-title><source>Cancer</source><year>1987</year><volume>60</volume><fpage>1346</fpage><lpage>52</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3040215</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="OMV012C2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kitada</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hayashi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ishibashi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Miyokawa</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the lung: a case report</article-title><source>J Cardiothorac Surg</source><year>2011</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>132</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21985459</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="OMV012C3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Travis</surname><given-names>WD</given-names></name><name><surname>Brambilia</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Muller-Hermelink</surname><given-names>HK</given-names></name><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>World Health Organization Classification of Tumours</article-title><source>Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart</source><year>2004</year><publisher-loc>Lyon</publisher-loc><publisher-name>IARC Press</publisher-name><fpage>63</fpage><lpage>64</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="OMV012C4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the bronchus: a review</article-title><source>Arch Pathol Lab Med</source><year>2007</year><volume>131</volume><fpage>1400</fpage><lpage>1404</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17824797</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="OMV012C5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Klacsmann</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Eggleston</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the bronchus: an electron microscopic study of low grade and high grade variants</article-title><source>Cancer</source><year>1979</year><volume>43</volume><fpage>1720</fpage><lpage>1733</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">445363</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
