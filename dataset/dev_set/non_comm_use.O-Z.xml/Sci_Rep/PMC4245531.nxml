In the development of osteoporosis, it has been demonstrated that many changes occurred in the behavior of BMSCs. For example, the biological system of FasL pathways mediated differentiation of ERK and GSK-3&#x003b2;-catenin pathway was damaged. Here we found that 0.35&#x02005;mg/L Licochalcone A (L-A) had a strong effect in increasing the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of BMSCs both in vivo and in vitro by up-regulating FasL and further playing a role in regulating the ERK and GSK-3&#x003b2;-catenin systems. It has also demonstrated that the administration of L-A could restore the biological function of the damaged BMSCs differentiation by recovering or protecting bone mass in a disease state through activating the endosteal bone formation and partially inhibiting bone resorption in acute estrogen deficiency model. Results of our study suggested that careful titration of MSC was response to L-A and up-regulated FasL pathways mediating differentiation of ERK and GSK-3&#x003b2;-catenin biological systems under disease state in vivo, restore the impaired function, is one of the ways of L-A relieve or treatment osteoporosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Osteoporosis is a bone metabolism disease characterized by the loss of bone microarchitecture thus increasing the risk of bone fractures. The role of BMSCs in the pathogenesis and therapy of osteoporosis has drawn increasing attention in recent years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. FAS ligand (FasL) which binds to the Fas receptor is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the TNF family. It represents important apoptotic signaling in many cell types and the pathway of FasL-mediated FAS death has been extensively investigated in the interplay between immune cells, cancer cells and MSC-based immunomodulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Previous studies also showed that reduced osteoclast apoptosis might contribute to the osteoporotic phenotype and the administration of estrogen could up-regulate the FasL expression in osteoblasts to induce increased osteoclast apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies also showed that FasL promoted the proliferation of human BMSCs, inducing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in BMSCs downstream; thus concluded that the ERK1/2-dependent mechanism might be one of the pathways through which BMSCs maintained a stem cell phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. ERK could inactivate the expression of GSK-3&#x003b2; resulting in an up-regulation of beta-catenin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. The phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b2; achieved by ERK binding to it leads to the inactivation of GSK-3&#x003b2;. Thus the expression of &#x003b2;-catenin is increased in the cytoplasm and then it translocate to the nucleus interacting with Tcf/Lefand further leading to a series reactions. So the function of ERK and GSK-3&#x003b2;-catenin relationship might be an important regulator in BMSCs.</p><p>During the process of aging, especially for postmenopausal females, BMSCs in bone marrow shift to adipocyte gradually with a reduction of osteogenesis and bone formation, finally resulting in osteoporosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In this process, many changes occurred in the behavior of BMSCs such as self-renewal and differentiation ability in addition to cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle phases (depending on gene modification) and the production of cytokine and growth factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Our team previously found that the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs from estrogen deficiency rats with osteoporosis was decreased while the adipogenic differentiation was increased compared with normal BMSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. We also found that FasL significantly decreased and ERK and GSK-3&#x003b2;-catenin biological systems changed in BMSCs in the same model.</p><p>Some drugs, such as PTH, Bisphosphonates and vitamin D have been used in clinic to stimulate bone formation in osteoporosis patients. However, long-term trials showed that these drugs had no effect in preventing hip fracture. What was more, side-effects such as hypercalcaemia, nausea and diarrhea also happened in the long-term observation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. However, whether BMSCs respond to those drugs in vivo was unclear. As there is a growing consensus that regulating the behavior of BMSCs could increase bone formation, in this study we tried to use small molecular compounds to reverse the abnormal function of BMSCs,aiming to establish a new strategy to relieve or treat osteoporosis. Licorice, one of the most commonly used herbs in traditional medicine, Licochalcone A (L-A) derives from licorice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. It has been proven to have the ability of anti-inflammatory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, anti-parasitic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,anti-cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and anti-browning, depigmenting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and regulating bone metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Pharmacological activity of L-A has been broadly studied, but the molecular mechanism is not particularly clear, especially on the differentiation of BMSCs. In this study, we tried to investigate whether L-A had an effect on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vivo and in vitro. Results indicated that L-A could up-regulated the FasL expression and affect the ERK and GSK-3&#x003b2;-catenin pathway to rescue the differentiation disorder of osteoporotic BMSCs, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis as well as bone regenerative medicine.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Effects of L-A on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs</title><p>Flow-cytometry analysis showed that BMSCs highly expressed SCA-1, CD29, CD90, CD105 and CD106 while they did not express CD34 and CD45 (Figures not show). We screened different doses of L-A in the procedure of the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs to choose the optimal dose. L-A at low concentration of 0.035&#x02005;mg/L had minimal effect on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, whereas higher concentration of 35&#x02005;mg/L would inhibit BMSCs differentiation. L-A at the concentration ranged of 3.5&#x02005;mg~0.035&#x02005;mg/L would improve BMSCs osteogenic differentiation. And the 0.35&#x02005;mg/L was the optimal dose which could significantly improve the osteogenic differentiation. Under this concentration, Real-time PCR showed that osteogenic marker Col1a1, OCN, Runx-2 and OSX mRNA were significantly increased in L-A treated BMSCs group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1.b</xref>). Clearly, 0.35&#x02005;mg/L is the optimum concentration for L-A and this study would carry out under this concentration. Further study revealed that treatment of L-A increased both Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) stained positive colonies and alizarin red stained mineralized nodules in BMSCs that differentiated into osteoblasts as well as the quantitative ALP activity at day 7, 14 and the volume of calcium sediment yield at day 21 of osteogenic induction(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1.c</xref>). Osteogenic marker Col1a1, OCN, Runx-2 and OSX mRNA were also detected at day 7 and day 14, L-A significantly improved the BMSCs osteogenic differentiation in osteo-inducing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1.d</xref>). L-A was also administrated in the group of OVX-BMSCs and Aging-BMSCs and the same tendency was observed with previous results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 1. a, b; Supplementary Fig. 1. a, b</xref>). These results indicated that 0.35&#x02005;mg/L L-A had a pronounced ability to enhance BMSCs osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. To further confirm the role of L-A regulated FasL in BMSCs, we tested whether FasL knockdown in BMSCs rescued the function of L-A. The RT-real time PCR results showed that separate knockdown of FasL decreased the effect of L-A up-regulated MSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 7. a</xref>). Notably, western blot revealed that the knockdown of FasL decreased the effect of L-A up-regulated MSCs protein level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 7. b</xref>), suggesting that L-A up-regulated in the BMSCs functioned through their target gene FasL.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The mechanism of L-A regulating the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs</title><p>A number of factors and signaling pathways have important roles in the differentiation and stemness maintenance of BMSCs. Factors including BMP-2, FGF, IGF, Runkl/OPG, Fas/FasL and signaling pathways including Mapks, Wnt, Notch1, Nos, Oct4 were reported to participate in the BMSCs differentiation. To investigate the mechanism of L-A regulating BMSCs osteogenic differentiation, we performed Real-time PCR to study the possible genes which may participate in the procedure. Results showed that the expression level of FasL, target gene of Mapk signaling and &#x003b2;-catenin was significantly up-regulated while the expression of GSK-3&#x003b2; was down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2.a</xref>). To further confirm the results of real time PCR, results of western blot revealed that the protein expression of FasL, phosphorylation ERK1/2 and active-&#x003b2;-catenin was significantly up-regulated while GSK-3&#x003b2; was down-regulated at the day of 3, 7 and 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2.b</xref>) than control group (OS-C group). This phenomenon was observed both in BMSCs planted in normal cultural medium (L-A group) and osteo-inducing medium (OS-L-A group) which were administrated with L-A. In addition, we also measured gene expression level of FasL, ERK1/2, catenin and GSK-3b at the day of 3, 7 and 14 and results had the same tendency with results in protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2.c</xref>). It was worth noting that the protein and gene expression levels of Runx-2 were stronger in OS-L-A group than that in OS-C group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2.b, c</xref>).The same tendency was observed with those results in OVX-BMSCs and Aging-BMSCs groups too (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 1.c, d; Supplementary Fig. 2.c, d</xref>). These results suggested that L-A could stimulate the osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs by up-regulating the expression of FasL, phosphorylation ERK1/2, inactivated GSK-3b and activated-&#x003b2;-catenin.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Treatment with L-A partially recovers loss of trabecular bone and increases endosteal bone formation in OVX rats</title><p>To determine whether L-A could recover bone mass in a disease state, we treated 8-week-old ovariectomized (OVX) rats with PBS or L-A 12 weeks after OVX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3.a</xref>). OVX model was evaluated by micro CT, results revealed that the trabecular bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) and bone mineral density (BMD) were decreased and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) was increased than Sham group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3.b</xref>). TRAP/ALP staining results showed that the endosteal bone formation in trabecular bone in L-A treated group was increased (the black arrows indicated ALP positive) and the TRAP staining was weakly positive (the green arrows indicated) than OVX group. There was no difference in the same group between different time points over 4, 8 and 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3.c</xref>). At each time point, femur bone mass was also detected by micro CT and results indicated that L-A could partially recover the loss of trabecular bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3.d</xref>) by means of inducing a higher distal femoral trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) and bone mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3.f,g</xref>). The calceinfluorescent labeling of the newly formed bone observed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3.e</xref>) demonstrated the same tendency. Test of loading with a maximum load to the femur and fifth lumbar vertebral bodies (LVB) was also carried out in L-A group, OVX group and Sham group treated with PBS. Results also indicated that L-A group had a stronger potent of anti-pressure load than OVX group, no difference with statistical significance was found between L-A and Sham group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h, i</xref>).These data suggested that L-A could activate endosteal bone formation which nearly had the same characteristic of bone tissues in normal state in acute estrogen deficiency model and increase bone mass.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Treatment with L-A partially prevents trabecular bone loss and increases endosteal bone formation in OVX rats</title><p>To determine whether L-A could prevent trabecular bone loss in a disease state, we treated 8-week-old OVX rats with PBS, L-A 3 days after OVX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4.a</xref>). OVX model was evaluated by micro CT, after ovariectomized 3 days, BV/TV, BMD and Tb.Sp was detected, there is no difference between Sham group and OVX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4.b</xref>). The TRAP/ALP staining results showed that the TRAP positive (the green arrows indicated) is increased and ALP positive (the black arrows indicated) was decreased in OVX group at over time of 4, 8 and 12 weeks; but TRAP weakly positive and ALP stronger positive in Sham and L-A treat group at same time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4.c</xref>). And femur bone mass also detected by micro CT, L-A could prevent trabecular bone loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4.d</xref>), induced a higher distal femoral trabecular bone volume and bone mass to inhibit the bone resorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4.f, g</xref>). Compared to the OVX group, L-A could unremitting stimulate new bone formation and partially inhibit bone resorption. The calceinfluorescent labeling of the newly formed bone was also observed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4.e</xref>), with a corresponding greater maximum load of the femur and fifth LVB respectively in L-A group rats treated with L-A compared to OVX and Sham group treated with PBS, L-A group has a stronger potent of anti-pressure load than OVX group, no significantly difference between L-A and Sham group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4.h</xref>, i).These results suggested an activation of endosteal bone formation and partially inhibit bone resorption by L-A, that is comparable to normal rats bone formation in this acute estrogen deficiency model and increase bone mass.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The effects of L-A on the BMSCs proliferation and differentiation in osteoporosis state</title><p>The osteogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs from estrogen deficiency induced osteoporosis rats was decreased and L-A could recover the potent of BMSCs osteogenic differentiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 1.</xref>). To determine whether L-A could effects BMSCs proliferation and differentiation in the osteoporosis state, we treated 8-week-old OVX rats with PBS, L-A 6 weeks after OVX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5.a</xref>). OVX model was evaluated by micro CT, BV/TV and BMD were decreased and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) was significantly increased than Sham group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6.b</xref>). OVX rats were treated by L-A once a day, a week later, isolated BMSCs from L-A treated, Sham, OVX group rats and performed analysis at the first passage. Proliferation assay (cell clone and MTT assay) showed no difference between L-A treated rats BMSCs and Sham BMSCs, but significantly higher than OVX BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5.b</xref>). Osteogenic differentiation assay showed OVX BMSCs formed less ALP positive clone and mineralized nodules after osteogenic induction than L-A treated rats BMSCs and Sham BMSCs, in according with ALP activity and volume of calcium sediment yield, respectively. Real-time PCR showed that osteogenic marker Col1a1, OCN, RUNX2 and OSX mRNA expression were no significantly difference between L-A treated rats BMSCs and Sham BMSCs, but significantly higher than OVX BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5.c</xref>). Western blot revealed that the protein of FasL, phosphorylation ERK1/2 and active catenin in L-A treated rats BMSCs and Sham BMSCs is significantly up-regulated and GSK-3b is significantly down-regulated than OVX BMSCs at day7, but no difference between L-A treated rats BMSCs and Sham BMSCs. In addition, we also measured gene expression level of the FasL, ERK1/2, catenin and GSK-3b. It has the same point and tendency with the protein expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5.d</xref>). These results suggested that BMSCs was response L-A in vivo, up-regulated FasL, enhanced phosphorylation ERK1/2, inactivated GSK-3b and activated catenin to restore the biological function of the damaged BMSCs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>BMSCs treated by L-A augments bone formation in OVX rats</title><p>The osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs from estrogen deficiency induced osteoporosis rats was decreased and L-A could recover the potent of BMSCs osteogenic differentiation function in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 1.</xref>).

We intravenously injected L-A treated OVX-BMSCs, OVX-BMSCs, L-A treated Sham-BMSCs, Sham-BMSCs in OVX and Sham rats 6 weeks after surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6.a</xref>). OVX model was evaluated by micro CT, BV/TV and BMD was decreased and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) was significantly increased than Sham group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6.b</xref>). At 4 weeks and 8 weeks after injection, TRAP/ALP staining results showed that the positive TRAP staining (the green arrows indicated) was more significant in OVX and OVX-BMSCs injection groups while positive ALP staining (the black arrows indicated) was decreased in this two groups at the same time point. In accordance, TRAP staining and ALP staining in Sham, L-A treated OVX and Sham BMSCs, normal BMSCs injection groups showed an opposite trend at the same time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6.c</xref>).The femur bone mass was also detected by micro CT. We observed that OVX-BMSCs injection could not recover the loss of trabecular bone compared with the OVX group; however the newly formed bone tissues in L-A treated OVX-BMSCs injection group was nearly the same with normal BMSCs injection group compared OVX injection PBS negatively control, though a little lower than that of Sham injection PBS group. Newly formed bone tissues in L-A treated normal BMSCs group were a little higher than that of Sham injection PBS, but the difference was not statistically significant. Calceinfluorescent labeling of the newly formed bone tissues was observed at 4, 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6.d</xref>) and the distal femoral trabecular BV/TV and BMD were also analyzed, results were in accordance with that mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6.e, f</xref>).Test of maximum load to the femur and fifth LVB was carried out respectively in six groups. L-A treated OVX-MCSs injection OVX rats group, normal BMSCs injection OVX rats group had a stronger potent of anti-pressure load than OVX injection PBS and OVX-MCS injection OVX rats group, no difference with statistical significance was observed between Sham injection PBS and L-A treated normal BMSCs injection Sham group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g, h</xref>). These results suggested that L-A treated OVX-BMSCs could activate endosteal bone formation and increase bone mass.

So BMSCs response to L-A under disease state in vivo and recovering the impaired function was part of the possible mechanisms of L-A treating osteoporosis.</p><p>To further clear the relationship of L-A regulating FasL and BMSCs, Rodrigues et al. found that Fas, the receptor for FasL, was expressed during the procedure when MSC differentiated into osteoblasts, and continued to die significantly like undifferentiated MSC, emphasizing the need for continued protection of MSC differentiating into bone cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. But exogenously adding low level of FasL would promote proliferation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells while higher levels inhibited their differentiation into adipocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Previous studies showed that L-A can promote bone metabolism, promote osteoblast osteogenic differentiation inhibit osteoclast resorption<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Our recent research shows that L-A can promote cell-sheet secretion of extracellular matrix and osteogenic differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In this study, L-A significantly increased the expression of FasL, but no change in the expression of Fas was observed in BMSCs. We also found that decreasing of FasL in OVX-BMSCs led to a weaker cell potential for proliferation and differentiation. When BMSCs from various experimental groups including normal BMSCs, OVX-BMSCs, Aging-BMSCs were treated by L-A, the FasL expression was up-regulated and further enhanced the BMSCs osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. So it was important to maintain the stability of the FasL level or moderately increase its expression so as to keep the balance of proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs. FasL has the ability of promoting the proliferation of BMSCs, inducing the phosphorylating procedure of ERK1/2 and survival in up-regulation in BMSCs. And it was through ERK1/2-dependent mechanisms that BMSCs maintain stem cell phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. This phenomenon was observed in all the experimental groups especially in OVX-BMSCs treated by L-A and cells from L-A injection osteoporosis rats; the effect of L-A treated MSCs to augment bone formation and increase bone mass had the same effect with that of normal BMSCs injected group. We also found that the cell proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs from L-A intraperitoneal injected osteoporosis rats were not decreased. But BMSCs from osteoporosis rats without administrating L-A would regenerate a lower bone mass than the OVX group, it is the negative control. So maintaining the stem cell phenotype of BMSCs was very crucial for bone homeostasis. Previous studies has reported that stem cell phenotype could be maintained through FasL and p-ERK pathway which would be up regulated by L-A. ERK also associates with primary GSK-3&#x003b2; for its inactivation resulting in up-regulation of beta-catenin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. It's worth noting that activating GSK-3&#x003b2; can be obtained by inhibiting Wnt dependent signaling pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. ERK through binding to GSK-3&#x003b2; and phosphorylating GSK-3&#x003b2; leads to the inactivation of it. Thus the expression of &#x003b2;-catenin is increased in the cytoplasm and translocats to the nucleus interacting with Tcf/Lefand further leading the series reactions downstream. As a result, it is through FasL/p-ERK and GSK-3&#x003b2;-catenin pathway that L-A enhance the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of BMSCs and it would be a new pharmacology molecular mechanism of protecting bone metabolism and regulating bone regeneration.</p><p>FASL-mediated FAS death pathway has been extensively investigated in the interplay between immune cells, cancer cells and MSC-based immunomodulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. To locate the migration of injected BMSCs, we observed that almost all the GFP-BMSCs were entered the spleen and bone marrow after intravenous injection 24, 48&#x02005;hours, 7days and 14days while vascular walls of liver, heart and lung could only be observed only a few BMSCs; renal tissue was not detected the BMSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 3.</xref>). As immune function declines under osteoporosis condition, migration of normal BMSCs into spleen and bone marrow might regulate the immune function of OVX-rats and change the microenvironment of bone metabolism, inhibiting osteoclast function and promoting bone formation. In both BMSCs injection and L-A injection treating group, FASL-mediated FAS death pathway had been activated and thus may protect the bone metabolism through regulating the immune function and maintain the balance of osteoblast/osteoclast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. We also observed the portion of the BMSCs moved on femoral growth plate and trabecular bone surface in bone marrow. It may be directly involved in the regulation procedure of the inhibition of osteoclast activity, promoting osteoblast bone formation process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>.White arrows indicate).</p><p>In summary, we found L-A could significantly up-regulate the expression of FasL, enhance ERK phosphorylation, making ERK further binding to GSK-3&#x003b2; and phosphorylating it to lead to an inactivation of GSK-3&#x003b2;. As a result, stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin in BMSCs led to enhanced or recovered function of osteogenic differentiation of damaged cells both in vivo and in vitro. The results of our study suggested that careful titration of BMSCs respond L-A in vivo may be a promising avenue for the prevention of osteoporosis or the treatment of its early stages.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were performed according to the guidelines of the Animal Care Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China, and all experimental protocols were approved by Fourth Military Medical University.
