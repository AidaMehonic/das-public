ClC-7 is a chloride-proton exchanger localized in lysosomes and in the resorption lacuna in osteoclasts where it is essential for bone resorption. Thus, drugs targeted at ClC-7 have been proposed for ameliorating osteoporosis. However, functional assays suited for high throughput screening (HTS) of ClC-7 function are lacking. Here we describe two complementary variants of purely optical assays of the transport activity of ClC-7, redirected to the plasma membrane employing a genetically encoded fluorescent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/pH indicator fused to the ClC-7 protein. These simple and robust functional assays of ClC-7 transport are well-suited to be applied in HTS of small-molecule inhibitors and may help to develop drugs suited for the treatment of osteoporosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Osteoporosis, characterized by excessive osteoclast mediated bone resorption, affects millions of people worldwide with predominance in women and elderly people, becoming a major public health problem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The increase in the proportion of elderly people will have a dramatic impact on health care costs since it is expected that the number of osteoporotic fractures will double over the next 50 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In osteoporosis an imbalance of osteoblast mediated bone formation and osteoclast mediated bone resorption leads to progressive loss of bone mass and results in bone fragility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Bone resorption is directed by osteoclasts that release protons and proteases in the resorption lacunae causing the dissolution of hydroxyapatite, and the cleavage of matrix proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The acidification of the resorption lacunae, as in lysosomes, depends on chloride. Chloride ions have been proposed to maintain the electro-neutrality providing negative charges when protons are released in the lacuna and permits an efficient decrease of pH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, but the precise role of the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport into the resorption lacuna is not clear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Several approaches for the treatment of osteoporosis are currently available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> allowing diverse therapy strategies but initially rather effective treatments are associated sometimes with unwanted side-effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Thus, novel effective drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis may have a significant positive impact. A promising pharmacological target is the lysosomal Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger ClC-7&#x02009;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Loss of function of ClC-7, or of its associated beta subunit Ostm1, in man and mice lead to osteopetrosis, neurodegeneration and lysosomal storage disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The osteopetrotic phenotype is explained by the fact that the ion transport activity of ClC-7 is essential for the osteoclast mediated bone resorption. Conversely, osteoporosis is caused by excessive bone resorption. Thus, reducing bone resorption by blocking ClC-7 activity can be expected to provide a highly effective treatment of osteoporosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>ClC-7 associated with Ostm1 is an intracellular chloride-proton exchanger member of the CLC protein family localized in lysosomes and in the ruffled border of osteoclasts. Among anion-transporting CLC proteins some function as passive Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels and others work as active anion/proton antiporters with a stoichiometry of two-anions: one-proton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Human ClC-1, ClC-2, ClC-Ka, and ClC-Kb, are chloride ion channels expressed on the plasma membrane, whereas ClC-3, ClC-4, ClC-5, ClC-6, and ClC-7 are intracellular Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters localized mostly in endosomal and lysosomal membranes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>The lysosomal localization of ClC-7 precludes a classic electrophysiological approach for the investigation of its functional characteristics.

Exploiting this mutation, allowed Leisle et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> to characterize the biophysical properties of ClC-7 revealing a slow voltage dependent activation at voltages more positive than ~20&#x02005;mV and establishing a 2Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/1H<sup>+</sup> exchange stoichiometry similar to ClC-4 and ClC-5, the prokaryotic ClC-ec1 and the nitrate/proton antiporter AtCLCa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>Even though electrophysiology can be used to sharply investigate the characteristics of ion transporting membrane proteins, it is a time-consuming and labor-intensive technique and it is unlikely to be exploited in high throughput screening (HTS). An acid influx assay monitoring the effect of activation of the V-ATPase, in the presence of the potassium ionophore valinomycin (VAL) on human osteoclasts expressing ClC-7 was recently developed by Jensen et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.

In order to reduce the number of constructs to co-express, and to localize the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> sensor as close as possible to the transporter itself, we fused the E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed sensor to the cytoplasmic C-terminus of ClC-7, which did not alter the functional properties of ClC-7 (see below).

Consequently, we introduced these mutations in the constructs for our assay.

To additionally reduce the number of different cDNAs to transfect and to ensure the simultaneous and equivalent expression of ClC-7P<sup>PM</sup>-E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed and Ostm1, we constructed a plasmid in which the two cDNAs are linked by a self-cleavable 2A peptide. The 2A peptide mediates a co-translational cleavage producing multiple proteins from a polyprotein encoded by a single open reading frame<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p><p>The resulting construct (Ostm1-2AP-wtClC-7<sup>PM</sup>-E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed) was fully functional in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) and in transfected HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) showing the expected partial plasma membrane expression of the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

To circumvent this problem, we adopted two different strategies. In a first approach, we additionally introduced a mutation of the gating glutamate (E245A) which renders the transporter voltage-independent and which abolishes proton transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Also this construct (Ostm1-2AP-E245A-ClC-7<sup>PM</sup>-E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed) was fully functional in oocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) and in transfected HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). The outwardly directed current component was abolished when the extracellular chloride was removed and a shift of the reversal potential to more positive values was observable as expected from a chloride-selective current and in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. These constitutive, voltage-independent currents of the gating glutamate mutant render it amenable to the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> flux assay described below.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Development of the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> flux assay exploiting ClC-1 transport activity</title><p>In order to be able to test the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> flux assay with a blocking compound we first screened several commonly used chloride channel blockers on the gating glutamate mutant (E245A) expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Unfortunately, none of these compounds showed inhibitory activity with an EC-50 below 0.5&#x02005;mM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) with the most potent substance being RT-93<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, which has an EC-50 of 0.8&#x02005;mM, too large to be useful as a test compound.</p><p>Thus, in the absence of a suitable positive control, we set-up the assay using as a surrogate the plasma membrane localized ClC-1 chloride channel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> which is specifically blocked by 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (9-AC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. As for ClC-7, E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed was fused to the cytoplasmic C-terminus of ClC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and the functional expression of the channel in transiently transfected HEK293A cells was controlled using the patch-clamp technique (data not shown). As a negative control we transfected HEK293A cells with the soluble E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed sensor localizing in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p>The basic idea of the assay is to abruptly reduce the extracellular chloride concentration ([Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>) and to monitor the resulting ClC-1 mediated decrease of the intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>]<sub>int</sub>) that leads to an increase of the E<sup>2</sup>GFP fluorescence (via a reduced static quenching) by measuring the E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed fluorescence ratio. A critical feature of the assay is to carefully adjust the osmolarity of the solutions (by adding mannitol) to avoid the activation of endogenous volume regulated anion channels (VRAC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In order to provide a sustained driving force for chloride exit the potassium ionophore valinomycin (VAL) was added to the solutions.</p><p>Fluorescence was excited a 458&#x02005;nm and 482&#x02005;nm (for E<sup>2</sup>GFP) and 563&#x02005;nm (for DsRed ) and emission of the E<sup>2</sup>GFP fluorescence and DsRed fluorescence was split using a dual view configuration (Till photonics) and images were recorded with a EXI Blue camera (QImaging Retiga). Images were recorded at ~0.1&#x02005;Hz while the transfected cells were exposed to a drop in [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> (from 140&#x02005;mM to 0&#x02005;mM, in the continued presence of 100 &#x000b5;M valinomycin). In order to optimize the throughput of the screening assay using the iMIC microscope we exploited the possibility of the system to memorize a large number of positions (x-y-z) of the microscope stage (x-y) and objective height (z), to be able to scan a relatively large number of cells from the same culture dish, each at the single cell level. Following the abrupt decrease in [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> we observed a gradual increase of r<sub>Cl</sub> (r<sub>Cl</sub> = F458/F563) in ClC-1-E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) but not in cells transfected with the soluble E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Addition of 9-AC (500 &#x000b5;M), a specific blocker of ClC-1, eliminated the fluorescence increase in ClC-1 transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) and had no effect in E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). To quantify the fluorescence changes we calculated the change of r<sub>Cl</sub> at 100 seconds after the start of the perfusion with the 0&#x02005;Cl solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>). A dose response analysis of the blocking effect of 9-AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>) was conducted revealing an EC-50 value of ~1.6 &#x000b5;M, in good agreement with electrophysiological results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. These results confirm that the fluorescence change reflects specific chloride transport through ClC-1, and, importantly, that the assay is suitable for the investigation of the modulation effect of putative activators or blockers on the activity of a chloride transporting protein expressed in the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Application of the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> flux assay on the gating glutamate mutant E245A</title><p>We next tested the assay on the gating glutamate mutant of ClC-7.

A considerable increase of r<sub>Cl</sub> was observed, comparable to that seen with ClC-1-E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).

K<sup>+</sup> depolarization, but also optogenetic tools, would allow a depolarization to at most 0&#x02005;mV, insufficient for activation of ClC-7. In contrast, activation of a Na<sup>+</sup> selective channel might provide sufficient positive membrane voltage to drive ClC-7 mediated transport. We thus co-expressed Ostm1-wtClC-7<sup>PM</sup>-E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed with the peptide gated sodium channel FaNaCh, which is specifically activated by the small peptide FMRFamide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. A similar strategy has already been employed to activate the depolarization activated CLC-5 transporter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. HEK cells co-transfected with the two constructs were tested for functional expression of both Ostm1-2AP-wtClC-7<sup>PM</sup>-E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed and FaNaCh using the patch-clamp technique (data not shown). Despite the relatively large buffer capacity of the cytosol, transport mediated by ClC-7 is expected to produce a larger relative change in the intracellular proton concentration than in the intracellular Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> concentration. We thus concentrated on the fluorescence ratio F482/F458 = r<sub>pH</sub>, which directly reflects changes in pH and is insensitive to changes in Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Indeed, a striking increase of pH related fluorescence was observable when HEK cells expressing Ostm1-2AP-wtClC-7<sup>PM</sup>-E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed and FaNaCh were perfused with a solution containing FMRFamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), while the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> related fluorescence ratio changed only slightly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). No change in fluorescence was detected applying the same conditions to cells transfected with Ostm1-2AP-wtClC-7<sup>PM</sup>-E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed but without FaNaCh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The change of r<sub>pH</sub> at 100 seconds after the start of the perfusion with FMRF provides a robust readout of functional ClC-7 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Plasma membrane ion channels and ion transporters are difficult targets for high-throughput screening assays. Intracellular ion transporters are even more challenging, but these proteins represent an almost untapped class of drug targets. Among these is the lysosomal ClC-7 Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> / H<sup>+</sup> antiporter, a promising target to treat osteoporosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Here we report the development of simple all-optical assays, which provide robust signals of ClC-7/Ostm1 function based on the E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/pH sensor. The creation of constructs ensuring the equivalent and simultaneous expression of Ostm1 and ClC-7 in the plasma membrane, employing ClC-7 sorting mutants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and self-cleavable peptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> successfully solved the problem of the tricky measure of an intracellular membrane protein that compulsorily needs a beta subunit to be active. The fusion of the biosensor to the C-terminus does not modify the functional properties and the 2AP construct is able to mediate the expression of both the Ostm1 and the ClC-7 protein.</p><p>We applied two alternative strategies to cope with the problem that the transporter is activated only at large positive voltages. Firstly, we mutated the conserved gating glutamate to alanine which eliminates the voltage dependence and renders ClC-7 a passive Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> conductance. For this E245A mutant we established a Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> flux assay, which provides a simple readout of the transport function. To test the assay we used the ClC-1 Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel as a surrogate for which relatively high affinity blocker are available. For this channel the assay provided an accurate and robust readout of the pharmacological sensitivity of the channel.</p><p>Since the uncoupling mutant maintains the basic chloride permeation pathway it can be expected that drugs that block the E245A mutant will also inhibit the WT protein with a similar efficacy, but not the other way round. For example, drugs that interfere with the mechanism of the voltage-dependence might block the WT protein but not the uncoupling mutant. We thus sought an alternative assay for the WT transporter. To achieve a sufficient depolarization of the cell we co-expressed ClC-7 together with the peptide gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel FaNaCh, and measured the resulting intracellular alkalinization caused by the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport triggered by the application of the FMRF peptide.</p><p>Thus, we developed two complementary, all-optical assays for ClC-7 function, ready to be used in a pharmacological screening for ClC-7 inhibitors.</p><p>Nevertheless both assays can be further simplified for the adaption in miniaturized HTS assays. A first simplification regards the FaNaCh based assay in which two cDNAs have to be co-transfected and the FaNaCh protein expression is not visually possible. One solution could be the construction of viral vectors to assure a uniform and high-yield FaNaCh expression. Alternatively, the FaNaCh ORF could be joined onto the Ostm1-2AP-wtClC-7PM-E2GFP/DsRed construct using a second 2A peptide, insuring contemporaneous expression after transient transfection easily revealed by the presence of the E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed fluorescence.</p><p>Several simplifications of the optical system can be considered for both assays. For the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> flux assay (using the E245A mutant), it is not necessary to record pH changes and thus it is possible eliminate the E<sup>2</sup>GFP excitation at the pH sensitive wavelength (482&#x02005;nm). For the FaNaCh based alkalinization assay it is not necessary to record changes in the chloride concentration, and thus, the excitation and emission of the DsRed fluorescence can be eliminated. Consequently, in this second case it is also possible to simplify the fluorescence sensor eliminating the DsRed part. With these simplifications the assays could for example be implemented on a microplate reader necessitating two excitation frequencies, one or two emission lines and one solution application step for each assay. Applying both assays in parallel has the further advantage that positive hits emerging in one of the assays can be cross validated by the other one, providing hints on the mechanism of action of potential ClC-7 blockers.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Molecular biology and transient DNA expression</title><p>The N-terminal mutant (L23A-L24A-L36A-L37A named ClC-7<sup>PM</sup>) of rat ClC-7<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> with the E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/pH sensor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> fused to the C-terminus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, mouse Ostm1 and ClC-1-E<sup>2</sup>GFP/DsRed (C-term) were in pFrog, a pCDNA3 derived vector suitable for transient expression in HEK293 cells.

For two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, the standard extracellular solution contained (in mM): 100 NaCl, 5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 Hepes, pH 7.3. Chloride was changed by substitution of NaCl with NaGlutamate. For all the recordings the pulse protocol consisted of voltage steps of 100&#x02005;ms from &#x02212;140 to 60&#x02005;mV with 20&#x02005;mV increments from a holding potential of &#x02212;20&#x02005;mV, preceded by a 50&#x02005;ms conditioning prepulse to 60&#x02005;mV and followed by a 50&#x02005;ms postpulse to &#x02212;100&#x02005;mV.

For excitation we used Till Oligochrome a wavelength-switching device containing a stable Xenon light-source. Because of a slight imperfection, likely to be caused by a mechanical slip of the petri dish in the microscope fitting, the localization of the cells was slightly variable during time. This problem was resolved by adjusting our (self written) analysis software, developing a simple tracking feature. In this way up to 15 cells could be assayed in parallel for a single application of substances. The transfected cells were exposed to a change in [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> (<underline>140 Cl solution</underline>: 138&#x02005;mM NaCl, 2 KCl, 10 Hepes, 10 Glucose, 3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>,1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, Mannitol 100&#x02005;mM, Valinomycin 200&#x02005;&#x000b5;M; <underline>0 Cl solution</underline>: 140&#x02005;mM NaGluc, 2 CaGluc, 10 Hepes, 10 Glucose, 3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, Mannitol 100&#x02005;mM, Valinomycin 100 &#x000b5;M while excited at 458&#x02005;nm (100 msec exposition), 482&#x02005;nm (30 msec exposition) and 563&#x02005;nm (100 msec exposition). The iMIC filter GFP/DsRed and iMIC dichroic GFP/DsRed were used for all the acquisitions. The specific ClC-1 blocker, 9-AC was dissolved in DMSO and added to the solution to the desired concentration (DMSO &#x0003c; = 0.1 %). For the experiments requiring FaNaCh activation, 30 &#x000b5;M FMRFamide was added to the 140 Cl solution. The pH of all solutions was titrated to 7.3. For the analysis we defined: rCl = F458/F563 and r<sub>pH</sub> = F482*3.33/F458. The factor 3.33 stems from the 3.33 fold shorter exposition at the (brighter) 482 excitation wavelength. Data analysis was performed with the custom analysis programs Anavision and Ana (freely available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://users.ge.ibf.cnr.it/pusch">http://users.ge.ibf.cnr.it/pusch</ext-link>).
