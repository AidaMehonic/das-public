In the United States, one in 2,500 daily contact lens wearers and one in 500 overnight wearers develop bacterial keratitis each year. Corneal disease ranges from self-limiting to sight threatening, the latter requiring rapid diagnosis and treatment to prevent vision loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The organism most often isolated from contact lens associated corneal ulcers is <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Pseudomonas keratitis is a rapidly developing disease that can progress to involve the entire cornea within 48&#x02005;hours, which may lead to corneal perforation. The existing therapies often fail to control the excessive tissue damage that is induced during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. While antibiotic treatment can reduce the bacterial burden, tissue damage occurs as a result of exaggerated local inflammation. Thus, a combined therapy including agents that control local inflammatory responses could be highly beneficial.</p><p>As in any human infectious disease, inflammatory responses in microbial keratitis are both beneficial and harmful. Initially inflammatory mediators are needed to recruit polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and effectively resolve infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, if innate immunity elicits an overly-robust response, inflammatory mediators become a part of a hypersensitivity response, which contributes to tissue damage and increases pathology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Using model of bacterial keratitis in mice induced by scratch injury, typical of corneal trauma, we previously demonstrated that deficiency in macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) appears protective during acute infection induced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as evidenced by reduced corneal pathology and increased bacterial clearance when a small molecular inhibitor of MIF was used for treatment during infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Hence, a better understanding of MIF-driven processes in response to infection will pinpoint key molecular targets for development of innovative therapeutic strategies.</p><p>MIF is an integral component of inflammatory responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. MIF directly, or indirectly sustains expression of a large panel of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x0223c;-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-2, NO, COX2, products of the arachidonic acid pathway, matrix metalloproteinases, etc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The majority of these processes most likely depend on the interaction of MIF with a receptor complex composed of CD74/CD44, the former component being primarily studied as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II invariant chain and the later component noted for its ability to bind hyaluronic acid and other matrix metalloproteinases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Binding of MIF to CD74/CD44 results in activation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), production of PGE2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and further induction of inflammatory mediators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. About 8&#x02013;10% of total cellular CD74 is expressed on the cell surface complexed with CD44<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, suggesting that CD74 may have important non-chaperone &#x02013;related functions when complexed with CD44. Consistently, blockade of CD74 reduces MIF-dependent monocyte arrest <italic>ex vivo</italic>, chemokine expression, and neutrophil recruitment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>To examine the role of CD74 in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-induced ocular keratitis, CD74 KO and C57BL6 control mice were infected with different laboratory strains or clinical isolates of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and disease pathology examined. As expected, CD74 KO mice had milder disease progression with decreased proinflammatory mediators released such as IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;, and reduced bacterial presence in the cornea. However, topical inhibition of MIF by application of specific antibody onto the cornea promoted further recovery from the disease, suggesting that in addition to previously described MIF-induced CD74-dependent pathways, sensitization to disease occurs via MIF-triggered CD74-independent pathways.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Bacterial burdens after <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> eye infection are elevated in WT mice compared with CD74 KO mice</title><p>CD74 KO and C57BL6 WT mice were infected with different doses of the invasive <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain 6294 with corneal pathology and bacterial burdens determined at different times post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Forty-eight h after infection with 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/eye of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain 6294 the differences in bacterial loads between the CD74 KO and C57BL6 mice were significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>): there were about 1000-fold fewer bacteria recovered from the corneal tissue of the infected CD74 KO mice compared to the infected C57BL6 mice. Consistent with the reduced bacterial levels, the CD74 KO mice infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain 6294 had a significant decrease in corneal pathology (P = 0.01) as evident by haematoxylin-eosin staining of tissue sections obtained from the eyes of the infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). To determine whether the reduced pathology in the CD74 KO mice was evident following a higher bacterial challenge dose, separate cohorts of CD74 KO and C57BL6 WT mice were infected with a fifty-fold higher dose of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> 6294 (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/ mouse eye; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Under these conditions, the infected CD74 KO mice also exhibited milder disease with significantly fewer bacteria recovered from the infected corneas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, the pathology was not as radically reduced as when the lower bacterial inoculum was used to induce infection. As is known from published data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, if the infection is left to proceed for a longer period, perforation of the cornea will occur within 5 days in the C57BL6 mouse strain that is highly sensitive to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> keratitis. To determine whether the infected CD74 KO were capable of maintaining the milder phenotype, a separate cohort of mice were infected with <italic>P,aeruginosa</italic> 6294 and corneal pathology monitored. At 72&#x02005;h post-infection, the sensitive C57BL6 presented with significant corneal opacity, whereas the infected CD74 KO mice appeared to control the infection better (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistently, lower bacterial counts were recovered from the infected corneas of the CD74 KO mice.</p><p>To determine whether the reduced pathology in CD74 KO mice was specific to the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> 6294 strain, similar experiments were performed using another invasive <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain, PAO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), as well as a cytotoxic strain, 6077 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). In both cases, the bacterial levels recovered from the corneal tissue were lower in the infected CD74 KO when compared to the infected C57BL6 mice as early as 48&#x02005;h post-infection. Significant reduction in the pathology scores in the CD74 knockout mice was evident at 72&#x02005;h post-infection, consistent with the observations for the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain 6294.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CD74 regulates inflammatory responses to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></title><p>Since CD74 deficiency impairs MHCII-driven antigen presentation, it is possible that the activation of T-cell responses to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> could be altered in the CD74 KO mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Therefore, the observed lower bacterial burdens and, in some cases, milder disease in the CD74 KO may be due to alterations of the T-cell activation profile in addition to MIF-dependent activities. To examine the inflammatory cytokine profiles in the infected CD74 KO and C57BL6 control mice, cohorts of mice were inoculated with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> 6294 and a multiplex cytokine assay performed on corneal samples at 48&#x02005;h and 72&#x02005;h post-infection. At 48&#x02005;h after infection there were no significant differences in the levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, KC, IL-1&#x003b2;, or IFN-&#x003b3; between C57BL6 and CD74 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, no differences were measured in IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). However, at 72&#x02005;h post-infection TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; were modestly, but significantly decreased in the CD74 KO mice, whereas IFN-&#x003b3; showed the opposite tendency. IFN-&#x003b3; was significantly increased in the infected CD74 KO mice, when compared to the infected C57BL6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). There appeared to be a tendency for moderately elevated KC and IL-12, but it did not reach significance when the two groups of mice were analyzed.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CD74 KO mice recover from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-induced keratitis after local application of antibodies to MIF</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that MIF KO mice had reduced bacterial levels and pathology from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-induced ocular infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In contrast, the CD74 KO mice did not manifest the same degree of differences nor spontaneously recovered from disease, except when a low dose of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was used to induce infection. These observations suggested that MIF-induced responses are not completely coordinated with CD74-dependent responses and, therefore, it is likely that MIF induces responses to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection through an alternate means such as use of receptors in addition to CD74. To test this hypothesis experimentally, antibody to MIF was produced in rabbits and used to treat infected cohorts of CD74 KO and C57BL6 mice after the onset of keratitis.</p><p>Five &#x003bc;l of the rMIF antisera were applied onto the eyes of the infected mice every 8h after the onset of infection. The CD74 KO mice treated with the rMIF antisera exhibited a significant reduction in the corneal cfu and in the corneal pathology score compared to mice receiving normal rabbit antiserum (NRS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). To determine whether the combined administration of antibiotics and antisera to MIF promoted better disease recovery, CD74 KO and C57BL6 mice were infected with the gentamicin sensitive strain <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> 6294 and treated with gentamicin in combination with either anti-MIF antisera or NRS control antisera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figures 5B and 5C</xref>). Both the WT and CD74 KO mice treated with the combination of gentamicin and antisera to rMIF had lower bacterial burdens and corneal pathology compared to controls given gentamicin and NRS, and the CD74 KO mice given the combination treatment had no evidence of pathology or detectable bacterial infection when euthanized 48&#x02005;h after infection.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the eye, inflammation is strictly regulated to preserve delicate ocular tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. However, ocular infections can trigger intense inflammation raising important question: can controlled inhibition of inflammation be therapeutically beneficial during infection? We have demonstrated that inhibition of a key amplifier of inflammation &#x02013; MIF &#x02013; is therapeutically beneficial to control <italic>P. aeruginosa-</italic>induced eye infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Therefore, gaining insight into MIF-dependent signaling events is crucial for design of appropriate interventional therapies. Here, we analyzed the role of CD74, the putative MIF receptor, in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-induced pathology by characterizing ocular disease progression in the CD74 KO mice and C57BL6 control mice. Deficiency for CD74 appeared protective during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-induced corneal damage resulting generally in milder pathology or reduced tissue bacterial levels in the infected CD74 KO mice when compared to control mice. However, the protection was not comparable to what was previously observed in infected MIF KO mice, suggesting that MIF-triggered CD74-independent pathways, as well as a MIF-independent effects from loss of CD74, could contribute to the pathologic response to acute <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> keratitis in the absence of this molecule.</p><p>Several functions of CD74 distinct from MIF-induced signaling could contribute to the observed phenotype in the CD74 KO mice. CD74 functions as chaperone for MHC loading and regulates T cell maturation by affecting both the positive and negative selection of na&#x000ef;ve CD4+ T cells. Consequently, CD74 deficiency impairs MHCII-driven antigen presentation, resulting in changes in the CD4+ T cell maturation. However, CD74 KO mice are not devoid of CD4+ T cells, instead they have a reduced frequency of CD4+T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. It also appears that the CD4+ T cells from the CD74 KO mice proliferate normally <italic>in vitro</italic> and respond normally to immunization with protein antigens. Furthermore, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses appear comparable with that of the C57BL6 control mice, suggesting that Th1 skewing is occurring<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The ability of the na&#x000ef;ve CD4+ T cells in the CD74 KO mouse environment to develop into Th1 or, possibly Th17, subsets was verified in a colitis model wherein disease was induced by administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). TNBS challenged CD74 KO and C57BL6 mice had comparable inflammatory responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Interestingly, Topilski et al reported that the CD74 KO mice mounted slightly elevated IFN-&#x003b3; responses after antigenic challenge, suggestive of elevated Th1 responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Consistent with these findings, we do not find defects in Th1 inflammatory cytokine synthesis in response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> corneal challenge. The Th1 versus Th2 profiling was examined based on relative presence of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; in the corneal tissues. While the IL-2, IL-12 levels were comparable in the infected CD74 KO and C57BL6 mice, the IFN-&#x003b3; levels were slightly elevated in the CD74 KO, when compared to the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-infected C57BL6 mice. Therefore, we ruled out that the milder phenotype observed in the CD74 KO was due to significant decrease in disease-mediating Th1 skewing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>The genetic background of the mice influences disease severity in ocular keratitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. While C57BL6 mice appear sensitive, BALB C mice have milder responses to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-induced keratitis. Therefore, a possible defect in Th2 skewing in the CD74 KO mice could affect disease progression in these animals. To address this issue, Th2 subset specific cytokines were quantified and no significant changes in the IL-4 and IL-5 levels were observed, suggesting no major alterations in the CD4+ Th2 subset skewing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). These data are consistent with previously reported observations that the CD74 KO mice develop normal Th2 responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>Previous reports have highlighted the importance of MIF-induced CD74 regulated inflammatory responses during autoimmune inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. MIF binding to the CD74/CD44 complex results in elevated MAPK activation and sustained cytokine production by macrophages and/or epithelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Our previous data suggested that protection against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-induced acute keratitis correlated with decreased TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-1&#x003b2; recovered from the infected corneas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Consistently, we observed lower levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; at 72h post-infection, but not at 48h post-infection, in CD74 KO mice, suggesting that a reduction in the sustained inflammatory responses may contribute to some of the lessened disease observed in these mice. However, as these differences were not manifest early in the infection they likely reflect the effects from reduced bacterial levels recovered from the CD74 KO mice, but these reductions probably came too late to have an impact on the initial development of inflammation-induced corneal damage during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection.</p><p>The conclusion that there are CD74-independent cellular response pathways that are induced by MIF supported by the observation that when the CD74 KO mice were therapeutically treated with antisera to MIF after the onset of disease there were further reductions in corneal pathology and bacterial burdens, consistent with previously published data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> that inhibiting MIF biologically reduced disease pathology in the infected C57BL6 mice. Future studies should establish whether these functions of MIF could be attributed to its ability to serve as a non-cognate ligand for CXCR2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> or relate to cell-intrinsic functions of MIF mediated by MIF-interacting intracellular proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, infection can negatively affect host fitness through two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can directly cause tissue damage through a variety of virulence activities. Secondly, tissue damage can be caused by the inflammatory responses to the pathogen. Thus, treatment of infection must come in two forms to enable recovery from the two sources of tissue damage. Our data shows that combined with antibiotic treatment, the antibody to MIF markedly reduced pathology and bacterial levels in WT C57BL6 mice, but essentially resulted in complete resolution of pathology and bacterial infection in the CD74 KO mice. These findings suggest that a combination of antibiotics, inhibition of MIF and inhibition of CD74-dependent signaling could provide an optimal therapeutic strategy for treating <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mice</title><p>All studies were performed in accordance with the Harvard Medical School Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.

The liposome composition was 25&#x02005;mg/mL lipids, 0.25&#x02005;mg/mL CpG, 1&#x02005;mg/mL rMIF. The lipids were formulated as a blend of 40% phosphatidyletanolamine (15&#x02236;0) (Avanti Polar Lipids, AL; 663&#x02005;g/mole), 40% phopshatidylcholine (15&#x02236;0) (Avanti Polar Lipids, AL; 705&#x02005;g/mole), 10% Cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids, AL; 386&#x02005;g/mole), 10% DC-Cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids, AL; 537&#x02005;g/mole). Rabbits were immunized in the popliteal lymph node with 100 &#x003bc;g rMIF/ liposome mixture, rested for three weeks, and then re-challenged again in the popliteal lymph node. After 4 weeks of rest, rabbits were immunized intramuscularly with 100 &#x003bc;g rMIF/liposomes and sera were harvested a week later.

Three 0.5&#x02005;cm scratches were made on the cornea and an inoculum of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> delivered in 5 &#x000b5;l onto the eye. Mice remained sedated for about 30&#x02005;min. For evaluation of corneal pathology, daily scores are recorded by an observer unaware of the experimental status of the animals based on a scoring system using a graded scale of 0 to 4 as follows: 0, eye macroscopically identical to the uninfected contra-lateral control eye; 1, faint opacity partially covering the pupil; 2, dense opacity covering the pupil; 3, dense opacity covering the entire anterior segment; and 4, perforation of the cornea, phthisis bulbi, shrinkage of the globe after inflammatory disease, or both. To determine the levels of bacteria in the cornea 48 or 72&#x02005;h after infection, mice were sacrificed, eyes enucleated and corneas dissected from the ocular surface. To quantify the levels of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, corneas were excised and suspended in a tryptic soy broth, 0.5% Triton X-100 solution, vortexed, serial dilutions made and plated on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> selective cetrimide plates.</p><p>For treatment, groups of mice were infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain 6294, then treated topically for 2 days with 5 &#x000b5;l of a solution of 100 &#x000b5;g gentamicin/ml (Invitrogen, MD), along with a rabbit polyclonal antisera to MIF. Anti-sera and gentamycin treatments were administered every 8&#x02005;hours after the initiation of infection. Bacteria in the cornea were quantified 2 days after infection by homogenizing and plating the corneal tissue. Separate cohorts of CD74 KO mice were treated with either the antiserum to MIF or a pre-immune control antiserum in the absence of gentamicin.
