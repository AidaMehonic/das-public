Here, we introduce a quantitative fluorescence imaging (qFI) approach that converts spectrally-resolved data into images of absolute fluorophore concentration pixel-by-pixel across the surgical field of view (FOV). The resulting estimates are linear, accurate, and precise relative to true values, and spectral decomposition of multiple fluorophores is also achieved. Experiments with protoporphyrin IX in a glioma rodent model demonstrate <italic>in vivo</italic> quantitative and spectrally-resolved fluorescence imaging of infiltrating tumor margins for the first time. Moreover, we present images from human surgery which detect residual tumor not evident with state-of-the-art vFI. The wide-field qFI technique has broad implications for intraoperative surgical guidance because it provides near real-time quantitative assessment of multiple fluorescent biomarkers across the operative field.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The clinical foundation of surgical oncology is underpinned by the simple but universal premise that for most solid tumors achieving complete resection improves patient outcomes. Unfortunately, despite significant advances in surgical technology and technique<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, rates of complete resection remain surprisingly low and/or the need for re-excision persists in many primary cancers (e.g., in brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, breast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, and prostate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, among others). Intraoperative tissue characterization also enables conservation of normal tissue, which is critical to functional preservation or patient satisfaction and quality of life. For example, re-excision rates in breast lumpectomy have been reported to be as high as 40% in some studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, largely because of residual disease found at the margin of the resected specimen that was not apparent to the surgeon at time of procedure. Glandular preservation in prostate cancer surgery is desirable clinically<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, but has not been widely adopted because surgical margins have been difficult to identify intraoperatively without histologically assessing the excised tissue in the operating room (OR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>Nowhere are the principles of complete resection and the application of technology to meet the concomitant procedural challenges more evident than in neurosurgical oncology, where the highly invasive and infiltrative nature of malignant glioma typically leads to recurrence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Major technologies and procedural trends that apply across surgical specialties (i.e., wide-field, white-light visualization of the surgical field through the operating microscope (OM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, navigational tracking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, image-guidance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, intraoperative imaging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, etc.) were born in neurosurgery ORs, which have become a clinical platform for technology innovation and translation across all of surgery.</p><p>The most recent advances, now found in many modern OMs, involve use of light at specific wavelength(s) which stimulates fluorescent emissions from biomarkers that can be associated with specific tissues in the field-of-view (FOV), and offer the hope of identifying disease, intraoperatively, at the cellular and/or molecular levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Accordingly, visualization of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) red fluorescence induced by oral administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has become standard-of-care for resection of high-grade glioma in Germany based on outcomes from a randomized multi-center Phase III trial comparing progression free survival in patients undergoing either fluorescence-guided resection or conventional resection under white light visualization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>While these OMs have allowed surgeons wide-spread access to visual fluorescence imaging (vFI) in the OR, the information is <italic>not quantitative</italic> and resection decisions have been reached based on <italic>subjective assessments of the visible fluorescence</italic> (e.g., red fluorescence from PpIX) from the surgical surface. Current intraoperative vFI does not correct for the distorting, non-linear effects of tissue optical properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> which reduces the correlation between perceived fluorescence and actual biomarker concentration. Indeed, vFI leaves significant tumor undetected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> &#x02013; it does not take full advantage of the specificity of fluorescent biomarkers (e.g., because diagnostic concentrations exist which are not visible<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), or their spectral signatures (e.g., because single bandpass or longpass filters have typically been used to collect the fluorescence signal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Spectrally-resolved detection, i.e., detection of the full spectrum, enables decomposition of non-specific autofluorescence in tissue, which improves image contrast and detection accuracy of cancer-specific biomarkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. With the advent of intraoperative fluorescence imaging and accompanying fluorophores for surgical guidance (e.g., PpIX<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, folate receptor targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, fluorescent peptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, blood pooling agents such as fluorescein and indocyanine green<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, etc.), decomposition of overlapping fluorescent agents from the same emission signal becomes possible with spectrally-resolved approaches, thus allowing simultaneous, spatially-coregistered <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of multiple reporters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present the first demonstration of wide-field quantitative fluorescence imaging (qFI) <italic>in vivo</italic> for intraoperative surgical guidance. Critical to this success is spectrally-resolved image capture with concomitant correction of the emitted fluorescence for tissue optical property variations and fast (near real-time) data processing to estimate absolute fluorophore concentrations pixel-by-pixel across the FOV. Quantitative results are reported for both animal and human intracranial tumors in the intraoperative setting. Here, we show pre-clinical imaging of PpIX and fluorescein in tissue, resulting from simultaneous detection of full visible spectrum fluorescence in the same animal tumors. Quantitative identification of more than one fluorophore within the same FOV offers new possibilities for simultaneously delineating multiple tissue characteristics of critical importance to the surgeon. We also show the first human results of qFI as a novel imaging technique to improve tumor detection during the resection of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). While we present these results in the setting of neurosurgery, the data acquisition and processing methods reported for intraoperative wide-field qFI of absolute concentrations of multiple flourophores are readily applied to other fluorescent reporters and/or surgical oncology procedures.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phantom validation</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Quantification of fluorophore concentration</title><p>The quantitative performance of our wide-field qFI instrumentation in terms of estimating fluorophore concentration was evaluated and validated in phantoms.

At the start of surgery, four (4) of these animals also received an i.v. injection of 100&#x02005;mg/kg of 10% fluorescein sodium solution.

At the start of this surgery, vFI indicates a heterogeneous distribution of PpIX fluorescence whereas the corresponding qFI view demonstrates the presence of more significant, previously undetected tumor biomarker. Normal brain similarly does not show spectral evidence of tumor based on the qFI view which was confirmed by probe measurement. A similar series of image acquisitions near the end of surgery in the same patient illustrates no evidence of disease in the vFI view but histologically-confirmed residual tumor in the qFI images.

Critical to the success of the technique is acquisition of white-light reflectance spectra to correct the detected fluorescence for attenuation caused by tissue optical absorption and scattering in the fluorescence excitation and emission wavelength bands. The method produces quantitative estimates of fluorophore concentration, but also enables spectral decomposition of contributions from multiple fluorophores in the FOV.</p><p>Phantom results demonstrate the sensitivity and linearity of the approach to PpIX fluorescence. Specifically, we detected PpIX concentrations as low as 20&#x02005;ng/ml, independently of phantom optical properties, with linear changes in the imaged signal to increases in the true PpIX concentration up to 5000&#x02005;ng/ml. The absolute accuracy in the wide-field C<italic><sub>PpIX</sub></italic> image estimates was better than 25% and their precision resulted in a coefficient of variation across the image of less than 10% for all optical property combinations provided C<italic><sub>PpIX</sub></italic> was greater than 40&#x02005;ng/ml. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> human data indicate that a detection threshold of ~100&#x02005;ng/ml will provide positive predictive values in excess of 90%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Importantly, qFI was at least an order of magnitude more sensitive to PpIX concentration than vFI (~40&#x02005;ng/ml vs. ~600&#x02005;ng/ml), and generated improved contrast (~10:1) at concentrations at least one order of magnitude lower (~40&#x02005;ng/ml vs. ~600&#x02005;ng/ml for qFI compared to vFI, respectively).</p><p>Pre-clinical results in a rodent glioma model indicated that the qFI-derived C<italic><sub>PpIX</sub></italic> was also linear with the response of our quantitative, direct-contact optical spectroscopy probe and yielded a highly statistically significant (P&#x0003c; 0.001) correlation coefficient of 0.79 based on 41 measurements obtained from multiple animals. When C<italic><sub>PpIX</sub></italic> measured with the probe was greater than 40&#x02005;ng/ml, the mean percentage error (assuming the probe is the gold standard) in the <italic>in-vivo</italic> qFI-derived C<italic><sub>PpIX</sub></italic> estimates was 30% whereas the errors exceeded 100% when all probe data were included. These results are specific to this tumor biomarker and suggest that the <italic>in-vivo</italic> sensitivity of the qFI technique is presently about 40&#x02005;ng/ml which is below the intraoperative threshold of 100&#x02005;ng/ml based on our clinical experience with PpIX to date<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In these animals, we observed significant heterogeneity in the tumor bulk (with values ranging from 50&#x02005;ng/ml to 500&#x02005;ng/ml), and C<italic><sub>PpIX</sub></italic> levels up to 100&#x02005;ng/ml in the infiltrating margins that were not visibly apparent with vFI. These data indicate that our qFI technique can not only detect the more infiltrating margins of tumor, but also yields absolute concentrations with reasonable accuracy.</p><p>The importance of qFI relative to state-of-the-art vFI was particularly evident, and equally convincing, in the animals receiving both ALA and fluorescein as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> where the vFI view is substantially altered by the presence of fluorescein. Again, substantial PpIX concentration (C<italic><sub>PpIX</sub></italic>&#x0003e; 200&#x02005;ng/ml) is recovered in the tumor bulk that was not visually evident, and weaker but still accurate, PpIX concentrations (C<italic><sub>PpIX</sub></italic>~ 100&#x02005;ng/ml) are found in the infiltrating tumor margins, providing evidence of improved detection of invasive disease. An important caveat to these results is that the fluorescein images are not quantitative (rather normalized) because we did not determine the qFI calibration factors or investigate the optimal excitation/emission normalization bands to correct for tissue optical property distortions of the fluorescein fluorescence signal. While this optimization and calibration can be done, the non-quantitative nature of the fluorescein images does not diminish the significance of the PpIX results nor the ability to decompose measured spectra into estimates of absolute concentrations of multiple fluorophores. Quantitative, multiple reporter imaging opens the door to novel fluorescence detection approaches in the intraoperative setting (e.g., measurement of reporter kinetics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>The human data near the end of surgical resection was even more compelling in terms of the clinical importance of wide-field qFI surveillance. When tumor appeared to be completely removed by vFI, previously unidentified infiltrative tumor was evident with qFI enabling further resection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, wide-field qFI provided efficient detection compared with impractical, point-by-point application of a quantitative probe. These results suggest improved infiltrative tumor margin detection will be possible with our quantitative qFI technique.</p><p>While the qFI results presented in this paper are impressive (particularly the data in phantoms where the true C<italic><sub>PpIX</sub></italic> values are known and can be accurately quantified), further advances are likely to improve the wide-field qFI accuracy, <italic>especially in vivo at concentrations below 40&#x02005;ng/ml</italic>. For example, better instrumentation fidelity (a more sensitive camera and powerful light source) should increase the accuracy of the technique. Further, the approach described here relies on normalization with respect to pre-selected excitation and fluorescence emission wavelength bands which have been optimized to correct for the attenuation effects of tissue optical properties. A model-based strategy that compensates the fluorescence signal by explicitly estimating tissue optical absorption and scattering across the full spectrum, is anticipated to be more accurate and reduce dependencies on instrumentation and measurement calibration/scaling factors to convert the raw signal acquisitions into concentration estimates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Based on our experience during the development of the quantitative optical probe (which applies full-spectrum analyses), <italic>in vivo</italic> errors below 20% appear possible, although at the expense of considerably more computational effort that may be difficult to execute in near real-time in the OR.</p><p>In conclusion, we present a novel wide-field imaging technique, qFI, which provides quantitative and spectrally resolved images of fluorophore concentrations in (residual tumor) tissue, and readily integrates into the surgical workflow. Our approach demonstrates improved detection of residual disease compared to state-of-the-art vFI that could increase the completeness of tumor resection with preservation of normal function, which is known to correlate with improved patient outcomes. This method has potential for broad impact across other surgical oncology applications and in the detection of other fluorescent biomarkers of disease, including those that may be present simultaneously.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quantitative fluorescence imaging (qFI) system design</title><p>The quantitative fluorescence imaging (qFI) system used in this study (dimensions = 22.0&#x02005;cm x 5.0&#x02005;cm x 8.5&#x02005;cm, weight = 900&#x02005;g) consisted of three main components: a custom optical adapter, a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) (Cambridge Research Instruments), and a charged-coupled device (CCD) camera (PCO.Pixelfly, Cooke Corp.) connected to a computer control system as shown schematically and physically in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>. The custom adapter attached these components (LCTF and camera) to an optical port on a Zeiss Pentero OM, whereas commercially available components and optics (Edmund Optics) connected the LCTF and CCD camera. The LCTF performed fast (50&#x02005;ms) single-band filtering (7&#x02005;nm full-width at half-maximum) of incoming light in the visible range, &#x003bb; = 400 &#x02013; 720&#x02005;nm, and displayed a wavelength specific response with a maximum transmittance of 64% at 710&#x02005;nm. The CCD camera (1396 x 1024 pixels; 2 x 2 binning; 62% quantum efficiency at 580&#x02005;nm) sensed incoming light and transmitted the digital data to a computer control system. It had an enhanced red-near-infrared mode which improved sensitivity in that spectral region. Custom LabView&#x000ae; software (National Instruments, Austin, TX) integrated control of the data acquisition, processing, and image display.</p><p>The surgeon's FOV through the OM was co-registered with the qFI data, providing one-to-one comparisons. At standard working distances between the OM and surgical field, the maximum and minimum FOVs were 50&#x02005;mm x 40&#x02005;mm and 10&#x02005;mm x 7.5&#x02005;mm, respectively. Spectrally-resolved acquisition ranged from 2 to 8 seconds per white light and fluorescence image capture. Here, we operated in the visible portion of the spectrum to image two clinically-approved fluorescent dyes (i.e., PpIX and fluorescein).
