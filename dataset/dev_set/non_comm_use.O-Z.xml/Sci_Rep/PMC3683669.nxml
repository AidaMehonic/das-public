The Selkirk Rex breed is defined by an autosomal dominant woolly rexoid hair (ADWH) abnormality that is characterized by tightly curled hair shafts. A genome-wide case &#x02013; control association study was conducted using 9 curly coated Selkirk Rex and 29 controls, including straight-coated Selkirk Rex, British Shorthair and Persian, to localize the Selkirk autosomal dominant rexoid locus (SADRE). Although the control cats were from different breed lineages, they share recent breeding histories and were validated as controls by Bayesian clustering, multi-dimensional scaling and genomic inflation. A significant association was found on cat chromosome B4 (<italic>P<sub>raw</sub></italic> = 2.87 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>), and a unique haplotype spanning ~600&#x02005;Kb was found in all the curly coated cats.

One study revealed two alleles (<italic>KRT71<sup>re</sup></italic> and <italic>KRT71<sup>hr</sup></italic>) within <italic>KRT71</italic>, a crucial gene for keratinization in the HF, which are responsible for recessive hypotricosis <italic>Hairless</italic> (<italic>Hr, hr</italic>) locus of the Sphynx breed and the <italic>Rex</italic> hair locus (<italic>Re, re</italic>) of the curly coated Devon Rex breed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. A second rexoid locus (<italic>R, r</italic>) with a mutation within <italic>P2RY5</italic> is responsible for the autosomal recessive woolly hair in the Cornish Rex breed (Gandolfi 2013, in press). For each of these autosomal recessive rexoid / woolly hair conditions, the identified mutations are responsible for a major change in the hair follicle, altering hair formation. Several dominant rexoid / woolly hair conditions define other breeds, such as Selkirk Rex, LaPerm and American Wirehair, and these mutations await identification and characterization.</p><p>The Selkirk Rex breed harbors the most recently derived rexoid coat mutation that has successfully been developed into an internationally recognized breed in the domestic cat fancy. The breed is proposed to have originated from a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in a domestic cat in 1987, and a previous study estimates that an average of only 8.4 generations elapsed since the occurrence of the Selkirk Rex rexoid mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. To maintain genetic diversity and import aesthetic features, such as a round and sturdy body type, wide-set eyes and ears, long hair and a moderately brachycephalic muzzle, the Selkirk Rex has been extensively crossed to British Shorthair, Exotic Shorthair, and Persians to establish the breed. Filler <italic>et al</italic>. (2012) confirmed the out-crossing history, and shows that British Shorthair, Exotic Shorthair, Persian, Selkirk Rex, and Scottish Fold constitute breed lineages of a higher order grouping, referred to as the &#x0201c;Persian family&#x0201d; of breeds.</p><p>The autosomal dominant forms of woolly hair / hair loss disorders in human have been shown to result from mutations in <italic>corneodesmosin</italic> (<italic>CDSN</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, the inhibitory upstream open reading frame (U2HR) of <italic>hairless</italic> (<italic>HR</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <italic>APC-downregulated-by-1</italic> (<italic>APCDD1</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <italic>Kertain-71</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and <italic>Keratin-74</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Yet human studies have not fully elucidated the molecular basis of hereditary hair disorders; hence, a better determination of pathogenic dominant mutations within genes is necessary. The rexoid domestic cat breeds are a model that can reveal new loci involved in hair texture and hair shaft anomalies, as well as characterize the effect of different mutations within the same loci as found in humans and other species.</p><p>A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed, using the illumina Infinium feline 63&#x02005;K iSelect DNA array, on curly and straight Selkirk Rex cats to identify the Selkirk Autosomal Dominant Rex (SADRE)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> locus responsible for the autosomal dominant rexoid hair in this cat breed. The dominant nature of the Selkirk Rex curly coat trait should provide an ideal situation for a case-control genome-wide association study. However, due to the lack of sufficient number of straight hair Selkirk Rex individuals, Persian and Scottish Fold were used as controls, as these breeds possess the same population genetic background as Selkirk Rex.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome-wide association study</title><p>A dataset composed of 17 curly coated Selkirk Rex, and 62 straight haired cats (Selkirk Rex (n = 7), Scottish Fold (n = 32), and Persian (n = 23)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) were genotyped on the DNA array. Only one Scottish Fold was excluded due to low genotyping rate (MIND &#x0003e; 0.2). The remaining samples were evaluated for population stratification and relatedness. The stratification analysis assessed by multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) revealed 3 main clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S1a</xref>). One cluster consisted of a majority of the Persians; a second cluster containing the Selkirk Rex cases and controls, and a third cluster represented by a small subset of Scottish Folds. The remainder of the Persians, and the majority of the Scottish Folds, spanned the interval across the two antipodal populations. The two Persian and Scottish Fold outlier groups (n = 18 and n = 7, respectively) were excluded from further analysis. After removing these outliers, 17 cases and 36 controls (n = 53) were evaluated for relatedness. Nine Selkirk Rex individuals (one with straight hair and eight with curly hair) and six Scottish Fold exhibited a <inline-formula id="m1"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e276" xlink:href="srep02000-m1.jpg"/></inline-formula> &#x0003e; 0.3 and were excluded from the dataset for the association study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S1b</xref>). The exclusion of the related individuals reduced the genomic inflation factor (&#x003bb;) from 2.15 to 1.46 and is depicted on a quantile-quantile plot (Q-Q) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>A genome-wide association analysis of nine cases (curly coated Selkirk Rex) and 29 controls (six straight Selkirk Rex, five Persian and 18 Scottish Fold) was performed. After genotyping pruning of the 62,897 array SNPs for low minor allele frequency (MAF) and poor SNP genotypes, 10,344 SNPs were removed from further analysis due to a MAF &#x0003c; 5% and 677 SNPs failed missingness (GENO &#x0003e; 0.2). The highest significant association was identified on cat chromosome B4 at position 81,264,280 (Felis_cats 6.2/felCat5 release) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).

The region that differentiated between the curly Selkirk Rex and any of the control populations overlapped with the association region, particularly as demonstrated by the Selkirk Rex and Scottish Fold comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S3</xref>). No other region in the genome exhibited as significant differentiation.</p><p>A haplotype block spanning ~1.75&#x02005;Mb, from B4 positions 80,034,952 to 81,762,9005, was detected with a frequency of 0.5 across all cases (curly coated) and a frequency of 0.125 across the Selkirk Rex controls (straight coated). Within the block, from positions 81,210,239 to 81,789,564, a smaller haplotype block spanning ~600&#x02005;Kb with a frequency of 0.89 within the cases was identified. The haplotype was unique to the curly Selkirk Rex phenotype and was not shared with the controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S4</xref>).

To determine whether population stratification within the Persian-family breeds (Selkirk Rex, Persian, and Scottish Fold) was significant and would affect the GWAS, a known genetically distant breed (Birman) was assessed for population structure with the aforementioned populations in a combined pool. The Birman breed was used as a phylogenetic control to test the hypothesis that the Persian-family of breeds are genetically indistinguishable in relation to a newly diverged lineage, such as the Selkirk Rex. As expected, when population structure was examined for K = 2 to K = 8, the best fit of the data across this set of breeds was represented by two groups (K = 2), the Birmans and the three Persian-family breeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In contrast, differentiation between the Persian-family breeds at K &#x0003e; 2 was not well supported.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Candidate gene analyses (<italic>KRT72, KRT73, KRT74</italic>)</title><p>A partial <italic>KRT72</italic> (GenBank accession no.

Genomic and RNA sequence was acquired as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. A missense substitution at position 328 of the CDS causes an amino acid substitution, from a glutamic acid to a lysine. The mutation occurs in only one of the curly Selkirk Rex included in the sequencing. A second mutation detected genomically that causes a switch from a guanine to a cytosine at position c.445-1 of the CDS, likely disrupts the highly conserved acceptor splicing site of intron one. The mutation was present in the two curly coated Selkirk Rex and was absent in the straight hair Selkirk Rex, therefore was further investigated in detail. Sequence of the complete RNA transcript revealed that an alternative downstream acceptor was employed. The new alternative acceptor site was found within the first 18&#x02005;bp of exon 2 (r.445_464del), thus an alternative splice site was recognized at base 18 in the modified exon 2. <italic>In silico</italic> translation predicted the loss of 6 amino acids in the <italic>KRT71</italic> protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S5, Figure S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>KRT71</italic> genotyping analyses</title><p>Fifty-nine unrelated straight and curly coated Selkirk Rex were genotyped for the identified c.445-1G &#x0003e; C polymorphism.

In cats, new breed establishment is often due to artificial selection on a specific single gene trait, often responsible for an aesthetic pleasing phenotype, such as curly hair coats. These traits can reach fixation in the breed within only a few generations due to intense positive selection. This recent establishment of cat breeds and the strong selection of traits allows for powerful and highly efficient mapping of loci. One of the most recently developed breeds, the Selkirk Rex, is defined by an autosomal dominant rexoid coat mutation that occurred within the past ~10 generations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The phenotype has complete penetrance and a clearly defined presentation. This curly coat phenotype was the original characteristic of the Selkirk Rex that defined the breed, and is not present or segregating in any other known cat breeds or populations. However, the LaPerm breed also has an autosomal dominant with a similar curly coated presentation.</p><p>In this study, to localize the rexoid phenotype of the Selkirk Rex, nine cases and 29 controls detected an association to cat chromosome B4. The recent origins of the breed and the positive selection for the trait in the cases produced extended linkage disequilibrium and haplotype blocks, making genome-wide association mapping amenable with fewer markers and fewer individuals. However, proper selection of controls was challenging because few Selkirk Rex are straight-coated since the phenotype is near fixation in the breed. In addition, Selkirk Rex are not a popular breed, with only 176 cats were registered in 2012 by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), ranking 23<sup>rd</sup> of 42 breeds in popularity. In 2012, the Selkirk Rex breed had 68 registered litters, compared to the 4959 litters registered as the Persian breed, the most popular cat breed in the USA (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cfa.org">www.cfa.org</ext-link>). The low number of individuals made ascertainment challenging. Straight-haired Selkirk Rex are rarely presented in cat shows, sometimes competing in the household pet category, hence ascertain was usually by solicitation of the breeder and not collection at cat shows. Therefore, because of an insufficient number of controls, straight-haired cats from different breeds were considered for the GWAS.</p><p>Several analyses were conducted to validate the controls for the Selkirk Rex GWAS. Previous population structure analysis placed the Selkirk Rex in a class of breeds termed the &#x0201c;Persian-family&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. This population cluster consists of five breeds: British shorthair, Exotic shorthair, Persian, Scottish Fold, and Selkirk Rex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Persian and Scottish Fold members of the same breed family were included in the analyses as controls. These cats were fortuitously available from other array studies that required Persians and Scottish Folds. The admixture analysis supported the use of sister breeds as controls, and further suggested that little genetic stratification is evident in the individuals examined. Genome-wide F<sub>ST </sub>analysis further demonstrated that the only significant difference between the Selkirk Rex curly group and the other control breeds is within the region that harbors the phenotypic trait under positive selection. Additional evidence is provided by the genomic inflation value, where the population sub-structure in the analyses is due to the inherent relatedness of the cats, rather than a different genetic background across samples.</p><p>The significant association detected on cat chromosome B4 contained a cluster of keratin genes. Keratins consist of two groups, type I (acidic) and type II (neutral to basic), of intermediate filament proteins that can be found on human chromosomes 17 and 12 and on cat chromosomes E1 and B4, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Hair keratins form a strong unmineralized tissue within the HF controlling the hair structure and morphogenesis. Type I and II keratins form keratin intermediate filaments in the cytoplasm through heterodimerization and contribute to cytoskeleton formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The epithelial keratin family contains hair follicle-specific keratins (<italic>KRT25, KRT26, KRT27, KRT28, KRT71, KRT72, KRT73, KRT74, KRT75).</italic> The haplotype analysis revealed a unique haplotype, spanning ~600&#x02005;Kb, exclusive to the curly coated Selkirk Rex. Of the extended keratin gene cluster, only the <italic>KRT71, KRT72, KRT73, KRT74</italic> and <italic>KRT75</italic> genes were found within the region of the unique haplotype. Due to their function and localization, the genes were considered excellent candidates for the Selkirk Rex phenotype.</p><p>A previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, conducted on <italic>KRT71</italic> on rexoid cat breeds, including Selkirk Rex, discouraged an initial analysis of this gene and therefore <italic>KRT71</italic> was re-examined only after the analyses of <italic>KRT74, KRT73</italic> and <italic>KRT72</italic> was proving unsuccessful. Furthermore, several recent human studies implicated mutations within <italic>KRT74</italic> to be associated with autosomal dominant woolly hair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Hence, <italic>KRT74</italic> was considered the highest priority candidate gene. After the characterizations of the <italic>KRT74, KRT73</italic> and <italic>KRT72</italic> keratins in the curly Selkirk Rex, the owners of the cats analyzed in the previous study were contacted to confirm phenotypes. The Selkirk Rex used in the previous study was ascertained at a cat show and entered in the laboratory database as a curly-coated Selkirk Rex since only curly coated Selkirk Rex can be shown for competition. The Selkirk Rex cat used in 2010 study actually competed in the household pet category and had straight hair, hence incorrectly phenotyped. Therefore, <italic>KRT71</italic> was incorrectly excluded as a candidate gene for the hair condition.</p><p>The identified <italic>KRT71</italic> splice variant within the Selkirk Rex breed is confirmed by genomic analysis and segregates concordantly with the phenotype in all 47 unrelated curly Selkirk Rex analyzed. <italic>KRT71</italic> CDS in cats is 1575&#x02005;bp, which translates into a 524 amino acid protein. The keratin protein consists of three domains: an N-terminal head domain, a low-complexity coiled-coil C-terminal domain and the helix-forming &#x003b1;-helical rod domain. The N terminus and the C terminus of the &#x003b1;-helical rod domain are known as the helix initiation motif (HIM) and helix termination motif (HTM), domains extremely conserved and critical in forming heteropolymers of specific type I and type II cytokeratin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.

Other dominant mutations in close proximity to the HIM and HTM domains are also reported in dogs and rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. As suggested by the human study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, the lack of the six amino acids within the &#x003b1;-helical rod domain of the cat, from positions 149 to 154 of the <italic>KRT71</italic> protein, may disrupt the endogenous keratin intermediate filament formation in a dominant-negative manner. The identified cat <italic>KRT71</italic> variant is unique to Selkirk Rex and was not identified in any other rexoid breed. Although the polymorphism is segregating concordantly with the phenotype in all the cats in this study and has not been identified in any other curly coated or straight-coated cats, the identified mutation may only represent a concordant variant in LD with the causative variant that would be elsewhere in the region.</p><p>Consistent with nomenclature of the mouse, <italic>SADRE</italic> was the suggested locus designation for the Selkirk autosomal dominant rex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> hence <italic>KRT71<sup>SADRE</sup></italic> is the suggested allele designation forming the allelic progression <italic>KRT71<sup>SADRE</sup></italic> &#x0003e; <italic>KRT71<sup>+</sup>.</italic> Downstream mutations within the same domain are responsible for the autosomal recessive curly hair in Devon Rex, <italic>KRT71<sup>re</sup></italic>, and the naked phenotype of the Sphynx breed, <italic>KRT71<sup>hr</sup></italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

Potentially, mutations in Devon Rex and Sphynx within the &#x003b1;-helical rod domain are recessive because the truncated <italic>KRT71</italic> protein can still form heterodimers incorporated in the hair shaft.</p><p>Three mutations in KRT71 have now been identified in cats, forming the allelic series, <italic>KRT71<sup>SADRE</sup></italic> &#x0003e; <italic>KRT71<sup>+</sup> &#x0003e; KRT71<sup>re</sup> &#x0003e; KRT71<sup>hr</sup></italic>. For the first time in cats, a mutation within <italic>KRT71</italic> is linked to an autosomal dominant form of curly hair coat.
