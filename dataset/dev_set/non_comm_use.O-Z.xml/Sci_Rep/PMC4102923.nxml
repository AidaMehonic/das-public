In this study, we demonstrate that various types of macrophages internalize microvesicles, called exosomes, secreted by breast cancer and non-cancerous cell lines. Although both types of exosomes targeted macrophages, only cancer-derived exosomes stimulated NF-&#x003ba;B activation in macrophages resulting in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF&#x003b1;, GCSF, and CCL2. <italic>In vivo</italic> mouse experiments confirmed that intravenously injected exosomes are efficiently internalized by macrophages in the lung and brain, which correlated with upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. In mice bearing xenografted human breast cancers, tumor-derived exosomes were internalized by macrophages in axillary lymph nodes thereby triggering expression of IL-6. Genetic ablation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or MyD88, a critical signaling adaptor in the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, completely abolished the effect of tumor-derived exosomes. In contrast, inhibition of TLR4 or endosomal TLRs (TLR3/7/8/9) failed to abrogate NF-&#x003ba;B activation by exosomes. We further found that palmitoylated proteins present on the surface of tumor-secreted exosomes contributed to NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Thus, our results highlight a novel mechanism used by breast cancer cells to induce pro-inflammatory activity of distant macrophages through circulating exosomal vesicles secreted during cancer progression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The dualistic role of the immune system in preventing and supporting tumor progression has been recognized in the past two decades. Immune responses against tumor antigens may inhibit tumor progression, but at the same time, inflammation generated by immune cells has been shown to enhance tumor growth and metastases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Along with the influence on the development and growth of primary tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, inflammation plays a major role in preparing distant sites in the body for colonization by metastatic tumor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. While the presence of immune cells was originally thought to represent an attempt by the immune system to eradicate tumors, recent findings support the role of inflammation in promoting tumor growth by providing a host of molecules including growth factors, survival factors, pro-angiogenic factors, and extracellular matrix-modifying enzymes, all of which serve to adapt the microenvironment for tumor proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Macrophages are among the most abundant of innate immune cell types that function in the primary tumor and at metastatic sites. As phagocytes, macrophages serve to recognize, ingest, and destroy host invaders. Equally important is their ability to secrete cytokines and chemokines to recruit other immune cells and to orchestrate an effective pathogen-eliminating response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are well known for their tumor-promoting functions such as supporting tumor angiogenesis, invasion, matrix remodeling, as well as immune evasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In fact, for breast cancer patients, increased density of TAMs correlates with poor prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Macrophages are recruited to tumor sites from circulation in response to tumor-secreted chemoattractants leading to their accumulation in hypoxic, necrotic regions of the solid tumor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies suggested that macrophages and other myeloid immune cells play a role in preparing pre-metastatic sites for tumor cell colonization. In a Lewis lung carcinoma model, a tumor-derived extracellular protein, veriscan, stimulated myeloid cells at distant sites to promote metastases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The S1PR1-STAT3 signaling axis was shown to be activated in both tumor cells as well as myeloid cells at a pre-metastatic niche, thus promoting metastatic development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. These studies highlighted the importance of intercellular communication between tumor cells and myeloid cells at a distant site to establish the pre-metastatic niche<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In this study, we set out to characterize the modulation of macrophage activity by breast cancer cells mediated by cancer-secreted exosomes.</p><p>A large variety of different types of cells, including cancer cells, secrete significant amounts of small vesicles (40&#x02013;100&#x02005;nm) known as exosomes following fusion of multivesicular endosomal membranes with the cell surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The exosomes carry a variety of proteins, mRNAs, and small RNAs, all of which may functionally alter recipient cells that interact with exosomes. Exosomes have long been appreciated as mediators of intercellular communication, first as B cell-derived stimulators of an immune response by T-lymphocytes and more recently, as encapsulators of protein expression-modifying RNA species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the contents of cancer-secreted exosomes can be transferred to other cell types in the primary tumor microenvironment and pre-metastatic niches to modulate cell function and facilitate tumor progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Therefore, cancer-secreted exosomes and their molecular contents have emerged as a highly important new group of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for cancer.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that breast cancer-derived exosomes are capable of inducing an inflammatory response in macrophages, which may ultimately contribute to metastatic tumor development. The cross-talk between tumor cells and macrophages required TLR2 expression on the surface of macrophages and was influenced by the presence of palmitoylated protein ligands on the surface of tumor-derived exosomes. These findings suggest an important mechanism used by cancer cells to modulate the activity of immune cells and promote metastasis.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Breast cancer-derived exosomes induce NF-&#x003ba;B activation in macrophages</title><p>We chose the MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines and the MCF10A non-cancerous mammary epithelial cell line to compare the effect of exosomes from a cancerous or normal origin. Exosomes were collected from cell culture supernatants and characterized by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>). The purity of our exosome preparations was assessed in electron micrographs showing membrane vesicles of appropriate size (50&#x02013;100&#x02005;nm) and a prototypical cup-like morphology (see inset for MCF10A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Expression of CD63, a characteristic protein marker of exosomes, was confirmed by Western blots of detergent solubilized exosome preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and by flow cytometric analysis of bead-captured exosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>). To determine if macrophages might be targets of mammary epithelial cell-derived exosomes, a lipid-associating fluorescent dye, DiI, was used to label exosome preparations, which were later incubated with RAW264.7 macrophages. Flow cytometric analysis showed that all three types of exosomes were internalized by the vast majority (&#x0003e;90%) of Raw macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p>As a critical cell type in innate immunity, macrophages are well known for their ability to induce inflammation. Given the important link between inflammation and cancer progression, we sought to determine if cancer-derived exosomes might influence the inflammatory response in macrophages. We focused our study on NF-&#x003ba;B, a critical transcription factor family involved in regulating inflammation, by making use of Raw cells stably expressing a luciferase reporter driven by a minimal murine c-fos promoter with two Ig&#x003ba; NF-&#x003ba;B motifs upstream (RawkB cells). RawkB cells incubated in the presence of exosomes isolated from either the cancerous MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-231 or 231) or MCF7 cells showed robust activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway as indicated by more than 60-fold induction of luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Remarkably, administration of an equal amount of exosomes isolated from the non-cancerous MCF10A cells (10A) resulted in only two-fold induction of luciferase activity compared to untreated RawkB cells. The difference in exosome stimulatory capacity is not due to cell culture medium conditions as non-conditioned media processed similarly for exosome harvesting did not induce a response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>). Analysis of key proteins in the NF-&#x003ba;B signal transduction cascade showed that cancer exosome treatment activated the classical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. The incubation of RawkB cells with cancer exosomes induced phosphorylation of NF-&#x003ba;B, IKKa/b heterodimers and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; in a similar manner as in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) used as a positive control. In addition, levels of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; in cancer exosome-treated macrophages were strongly reduced indicating NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). In summary, while both cancer-derived exosomes and non-cancerous exosomes are capable of associating with macrophages, only cancer-derived exosomes stimulate NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cancer-derived exosomes stimulate inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages</title><p>To assess which targets of NF-&#x003ba;B are expressed in macrophages following cancer exosome treatment, an inflammatory cytokine array was used to identify cytokines secreted into Raw cell culture supernatants following exosome treatment. Dramatic production of GCSF, IL-6, CCL2 (MCP1), and TNF&#x003b1; was induced by MDA-231- and MCF7-derived exosomes but not exosomes from non-malignant MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The array results were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR for Raw cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), and extended to other macrophage types, including human THP-1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>), primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), and primary Kupffer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>). In order to definitively link cancer exosome-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation to inflammatory cytokine production, an NF-&#x003ba;B pathway inhibitor, Bay 11-7082, was used to pretreat Raw cells prior to MDA-231 exosome administration. RT-PCR analysis of IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; mRNA levels demonstrated almost complete inhibition of cytokine expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>), indicating that cancer exosome-induced inflammatory cytokine production occurred through activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cancer-derived exosomes stimulate tissue resident macrophages in vivo</title><p>To validate our findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, we administered exosomes to immunocompromised mice. Exosomes were collected from MDA-231 and MCF10A cells, fluorescently labeled using DiI, and injected intravenously through the tail vein into nude mice. Following three weeks of twice weekly injections, we examined lung and brain tissues as these sites are known to frequently house metastases in breast cancer patients. Macrophages associating with DiI<sup>+</sup> exosomes could be detected in dissociated lung cells by flow cytometry following staining with anti-F4/80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The F4/80<sup>+</sup>/Dil<sup>+</sup> lung macrophages from mice administered MDA-231 or MCF10A fluorescent exosomes were sorted and differences in inflammatory cytokine gene expression between cell populations was queried by quantitative RT-PCR. On average, the levels of TNF&#x003b1; mRNA were two-fold higher in lung macrophages that internalized exosomes derived from MDA-231 cancer cells compared to DiI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> macrophages or lung macrophages from mice receiving control MCF10A exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Brain tissue sections from mice receiving fluorescent MDA-231 and MCF10A exosome injections were also analyzed by immunofluorescence. Staining with antibodies against F4/80 and IL-6 revealed populations of macrophages in the brain from MDA-231 exosome-treated mice that were exosome-associated and also expressing IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p>As an alternative strategy to explore tumor exosome-induced inflammation, we examined endogenously produced exosomes from a mammary fat pad xenografted MDA-231 primary tumor. Since MDA-231 is a human breast cancer implanted into a murine host, a species-specific anti-human CD63 antibody was used to detect tumor-derived exosomes internalized by CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages. Immunofluorescence imaging of axillary lymph node tissue sections identified populations of mouse CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages that internalized human CD63<sup>+</sup> exosomes, which seemed to correlate with expression of IL-6. In contrast, CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages that did not accumulate tumor-derived exosomes were negative for IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that an <italic>in vivo</italic> inflammatory response in tissue resident macrophages stimulated by tumor-derived exosomes could be produced similar to our <italic>in vitro</italic> results.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Proteins on the exosome surface stimulate the macrophage inflammatory response</title><p>Scientific interest in exosomes has exploded recently following the discovery that their mRNA and miRNA contents are capable of mediating intercellular communication. We therefore sought to differentiate possible mechanisms mediated by exosomal RNA or proteins for the stimulation of macrophages by cancer-secreted exosomes. A kinetic study was carried out to determine the time course of peak macrophage stimulation by tumor exosomes. MDA-231 exosomes were most highly stimulatory 4&#x02005;h after administration to macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Such relatively rapid macrophage stimulation pattern likely suggests receptor-mediated signaling rather than a miRNA-mediated effect also implicated in the effect of some tumor-derived exosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. To test this possibility in greater detail, we sought to distinguish between proteins on the exosomal surface and proteins enclosed within exosomes. Towards this end, MDA-231 exosomes were either sonicated or left intact and subsequently treated with proteinase K to eliminate surface proteins prior to stimulation of RawkB cells. For intact exosomes, the luciferase activity indicating NF-&#x003ba;B activation was decreased by one third following proteinase K treatment. The NF-&#x003ba;B-activating potential of sonicated exosomes was not significantly different from that of the intact exosomes, indicating that internal proteins do not contribute significantly to macrophage inflammation induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). To further distinguish between molecules on the exosome outer surface and those contained within, exosomes were treated with streptolysin O (SLO), a membrane-damaging extracellular toxin. MDA-231 exosomes treated with SLO to release all of the exosomal contents (and subsequently washed to remove released components) were as capable as untreated exosomes at stimulating macrophage inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The content of exosomes, therefore, may be unnecessary for activating inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages. The importance of exosomal surface-associated proteins was confirmed by acid washing exosomes to remove exosomal surface-associated proteins. Compared with untreated exosomes, the acid-washed exosomes had reduced, by about 75%, ability to stimulate macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Consistent with the luciferase data, induction of IL-6 expression by MDA-231 exosomes was also partially repressed by proteinase K or acid treatment but not SLO treatment of exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). These findings suggest that proteins associated with the exosome surface are largely responsible for the inflammation induction observed in macrophages.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cancer exosomes stimulate inflammatory cytokine production through TLR2 on macrophages</title><p>Central to the function of macrophages in infection and immunity is their ability to detect pathogens and to respond by initiating an inflammatory response. Initial sensing of pathogenic components is mediated by receptors on macrophages, which include the family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Since the response induced by cancer-derived exosomes is very similar in nature to an inflammatory response to pathogens, we investigated if exosomal stimulation might occur via similar receptors. To test whether exosomes stimulate through TLRs, bone marrow-derived macrophages were generated from mice deficient in MyD88, a common signaling adaptor for many of the different TLRs. When administered MDA-231 exosomes, MyD88<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<sup>&#x02212;</sup> macrophages were unable to produce the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 or TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a&#x02013;b</xref>). To determine which TLRs were specifically responsible for engaging cancer exosomes resulting in inflammatory cytokine production, we first tested macrophages derived from mice lacking both TLR2 and TLR4. Like the MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, the TLR2/4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages were also incapable of producing IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; in response to cancer exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a&#x02013;b</xref>). Chloroquine treatment of C57BL/6-derived macrophages to inhibit endosomal TLRs, such as TLR3/7/8/9, failed to abrogate NF-&#x003ba;B activation by exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). We next tested macrophages deficient in a single TLR. Although TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages retained the capacity to express inflammatory cytokines in response to cancer exosomes, the inflammatory cytokine production was completely abrogated in TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a&#x02013;b</xref>). Using a TLR2 neutralizing antibody, we further confirmed that blockade of TLR2 in Raw macrophages completely abolished NF-&#x003ba;B activation by cancer-secreted exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). These findings suggest that TLR2 on macrophages engages proteins on the surface of tumor exosomes, resulting in an inflammatory response by the stimulated macrophages.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Palmitoylated proteins on the cancer exosome surface bind to TLR2 contributing to NF-&#x003ba;B stimulation</title><p>While TLR2 can be highly promiscuous in its binding of ligands, a common feature of pathogenic molecules that engage the receptor is the presence of a lipid modification. To test the general requirement for a thioester containing lipoprotein, we treated exosomes with 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to convert the N-terminal cysteine-thioester substructure into a TLR2-inactive sulfoxide derivative. Thoroughly washed following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, treated exosomes could stimulate macrophages only 1/3 as effectively as untreated exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). To assess the type of lipid modification more specifically, hydroxylamine (HA) was used to cleave the acyl group on palmitoylated proteins. Thoroughly washed following HA treatment, exosomes lost about half of their NF-&#x003ba;B-stimulatory capability as compared to vehicle-treated exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The role of palmitoylation in macrophage stimulation was further tested by treating MDA-231 cells with a palmitoylation inhibiting agent, 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), and then collecting exosomes to treat RawkB cells. Exosomes derived from 2-BP-treated cells were reduced in their ability to stimulate macrophages by about 1/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Therefore, our results indicate that palmitoylated proteins located on the surface of cancer-secreted exosomes contribute to the exosome-induced, TLR2-dependent activation of NF-&#x003ba;B.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The &#x0201c;seed and soil&#x0201d; hypothesis, first set forth by Steven Paget<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, transformed the existing paradigm, shifting the focus of metastatic tumor development causality from intrinsic attributes of the tumor itself (the seed) to how hospitable a distant site (the soil) might be. These distant sites, or pre-metastatic niches, must evolve to become conducive to tumor cell engraftment and proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Cancer-derived adaptations of pre-metastatic niches often include one of the enabling hallmarks of cancer: tumor-promoting inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. This inflammatory response is generated by immune cells following direct or indirect stimulation by cancer cells, and one mechanism could be through the action of tumor-derived exosomes. Here, we demonstrate that breast cancer-derived exosomes are capable of inducing an inflammatory response in macrophages, which may ultimately result in an enhanced rate of metastatic tumor development.</p><p>Our results are partially consistent with a previous study showing that body fluid exosomes trigger NF-&#x003ba;B signaling and promote secretion of inflammatory cytokines in monocytic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. However, unlike the reported data that exosomes of both cancerous and non-cancerous origins can induce these effects and that both TLR2 and TLR4 are required for mediating the monocytic response to exosomes, we observe that only exosomes secreted by breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF7) but not the non-cancerous MCF10A cells are capable of stimulating macrophages, and that genetic ablation of TLR2 but not TLR4 in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages abolishes exosomes' effect. These discrepancies could be due to the different sources of exosomes and types of recipient cells used in the two studies, and may reflect a cell type- or tissue-specific manner of the exosome action. TLR2 has been implicated in the response of various types of immune cells to tumor-derived factors, including exosomes. It was recently reported that membrane-associated Hsp72 from tumor-derived exosomes triggered STAT3 activation in myeloid-derived suppressor cells in a TLR2/MyD88-dependent manner through autocrine production of IL-6, contributing to suppressed tumor immune surveillance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Cancer-secreted veriscan activates TLR2:TLR6 complexes to induce TNF&#x003b1; secretion by myeloid cells, therefore enhancing metastatic tumor growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In addition, a non-inflammatory role of TLR2 expressed in cancer cells has been documented, which contributes to the self-renewal of cancer stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. These results, along with our findings herein, provide evidence against the controversial use of TLR2 agonists in anti-tumor therapy.</p><p>TLR2 recognizes a structurally broad range of agonists, among which the lipoproteins/lipopeptides are sensed at physiological picomolar concentrations by TLR2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Our results show that the TLR2-dependent, macrophage-stimulating effect of cancer-derived exosomes is at least partially mediated by palmitoylated proteins on the exosome surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a&#x02013;c</xref>). To identify which palmitoylated protein(s) might be most important for macrophage stimulation, we performed an acyl-biotin exchange followed by a pull-down with streptavidin beads. The biotin-enriched sample was submitted for LCMS/MS analysis and a group of proteins were identified as being palmitoylated in MDA-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>). Some of these proteins that are also present in palmitoylated form on MDA-231-secreted exosomes, especially those expressed or palmitoylated at lower levels in MCF10A, may mediate NF-&#x003ba;B activation in macrophages through direct binding to TLR2. Towards this end, we selected CD44, NRAS, and TFRC (transferrin receptor protein 1) for further examination as these proteins have been previously related to cancer. Although all three proteins could be detected on MDA-231 exosomes at higher levels compared to MCF10A exosomes by Western blot, knockdown of each of the genes in MDA-231 cells by RNA interference did not affect the ability of MDA-231-secreted exosomes to stimulate NF-&#x003ba;B in recipient macrophages (data not shown). It is therefore possible that multiple palmitoylated proteins on the exosome surface contribute to the activation of TLR2 and thereby, NF-&#x003ba;B and inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages. In addition to exosomal proteins, cancer-derived exosomal miRNAs are reported to bind as ligands to TLRs in surrounding immune cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. As such, targeting the process of protein palmitoylation in cancer cells, interfering with exosome interaction with macrophages, and inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B activity in macrophages might be effective approaches to therapeutically block exosome-mediated activation of macrophages and the consequent pro-metastatic adaptation of tumor microenvironments.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cells, plasmids and viruses</title><p>Human cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7, and the non-cancerous cell line, MCF10A, were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and maintained in the recommended media in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37<bold>&#x000b0;</bold>C.

Washed beads were reduced and alkylated, allowing for detachment of proteins from the beads, followed by trypsin digestion and HPLC-MS. *p &#x0003c; 0.001.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep05750-f6"/></fig></floats-group></article>
