Howland award of the American Pediatric Society, probably the most prestigious award of American Pediatrics. Dr. Pearson had been nominated for the award by Dr. Norman Siegel. The Department of Pediatrics Grand Rounds on Wednesday noon, October 26, 2002 was originally scheduled as a repetition of the presentation by Dr. Siegel and the acceptance by Dr. Pearson for those who could not be in Baltimore. However; in a number of meetings, unknown to Dr. Siegel, it was unanimously decided that it would be very appropriate to instead honor him as he stepped down from his position as Vice- and Interim Chairman of Pediatrics, and to formally thank him for his long and faithful service to the Department of Pediatrics, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Yale New Haven Hospital.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00009-0070-a" xlink:role="308"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00009-0071-a" xlink:role="309"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00009-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="307" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00009-0070.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="308" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00009-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="309" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00009-0072.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="310" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00009-0073.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="311" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00009-0074.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="312" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
