While, the mean volume of the buccal fat pat is approximately 10&#x02009;ml, the main physiological function of the buccal fat pad is to fill the masticatory space and act as a cushion for the masticatory muscles. There have been studies on the use of the pedicled buccal fat pad for closure of oroantral or oronasal communications secondary to exodontias and for post-surgical oral defects for malignant lesions. In the fields of aesthetic surgery, the major reason for manipulating the buccal fat pad is to extract these fatty tissues in order to reduce prominent cheeks. Using the buccal fat pads to restore soft-tissue volume for volume-deficient areas is limitedly carried out by using the fat pads in a free graft method. Meanwhile, deficient soft-tissue volume in the malar and midface region causes a broad and flat facial appearance and often is related with the aging process which results in an old- or tired-look. By utilizing the buccal fat pads to the adjacent volume-deficient malar regions, a volume restoring and rejuvenating effect can be easily achieved. As the fat pads can be mobilized as a vascularized flap, concerns on volume resorption that is commonly noticed after conventional free fat transfer methods can be avoided. Also, the use of soft-tissue fillers or alloplastic implants can be avoided. Thus, long-term stability can be assured and its procedural simplicity, with very low complication rates and natural-looking results, encourage surgeons to use the pedicled buccal fat pad as a tool for malar and midface augmentation. This procedure can be easily combined with a reduction malarplasty procedure, as patients with laterally prominent zygomatic bones usually have deficient volume in the anterior malar region. While the lateral projections of the zygoma are reduced by reduction malarplasty, anterior malar volume can be restored concomitantly by utilizing the pedicled buccal fat pad through the same intraoral approach. The buccal fat pad is gently delivered atraumatically using non-toothed forceps from the masticatory space by blunt dissection while keeping the fascial envelope intact. The mobilized buccal fat pad then is fixed to the volume-deficient area with resorbable sutures.</p></body></article>
