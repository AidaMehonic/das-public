The purpose of this study was to investigate pain management trends at a tertiary academic institution.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective chart review was performed of all surgical repairs for primary craniosynostosis at The Johns Hopkins Hospital from January 2009 to May 2013. Demographic information, admission data, and post-operative pain management were recorded.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 57 patients were identified. Mean age was 12.6 months, mean length of stay was 3.2 days. 86% were admitted to ICU, the remainder admitted to an inpatient floor. 93% were prescribed IV parent/nurse controlled analgesia (PCA), with fentanyl (73.6%) being most utilized. 98.3% were prescribed acetaminophen. No patients received NSAIDs. 98.3% were prescribed enteral opioids and oxycodone was the only opioid utilized. Transition from IV to enteral opioids occurred on post-operative day (POD) 0&#x02013;2 in 45.6%, day 2&#x02013;3 in in 52.7%, and after day 4 in 1.8%. 89.3% were prescribed opioids for discharge, most commonly oxycodone.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite pain service consultation and immediate initiation of IV PCA use, over 40% of patients were transitioned to oral opioids by POD 1 and mean length of stay was 3 days. Our results indicate that utilization of opioids via PCA can provide effective pain control without delaying transition to oral analgesics or discharge to home.</p></body></article>
