Drought or high salinity is responsible for dramatic reductions in crop yield worldwide (Boyer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1982</xref>). To adapt to such detrimental conditions, plants have developed a variety of defense strategies, requiring many genes regulated by abiotic stress. Although a large number of genes regulated by salt and drought stress have been identified and their functions have been verified in abiotic stress (Bray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1997</xref>; Zhu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2002</xref>), the biological functions of many genes related to abiotic stress are still largely unknown in higher plants. Therefore, it is important to study the functions of stress-related genes to improve crop tolerance to salt and drought.</p><p>Ubiquitination is an essential process found in all eukaryotic cells, from unicellular yeast to human. The ubiquitination-proteasomal pathway has been implicated in diverse aspects of eukaryotic cellular regulation because of its ability to degrade intracellular proteins (Hershko and Ciechanover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>; Callis and Vierstra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). Ubiquitin (Ub), a small protein with 76 amino acid residues, is one of the most highly conserved proteins known in eukaryotes. Ubiquitination refers to the biochemical process through which Ub is covalently attached to substrate proteins. Ubiquitin binds to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), which activates Ub and transfers the activated ubiquitin to an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc or E2) to form an E2-Ub thiolester. The Ub is further transferred to the target protein either alone or in conjunction with an Ub ligase (Ubl or E3). The protein modified by an ubiquitin chain is subsequently degraded by the 26S proteasome. In the ubiquitination system, substrate specificity is mainly determined by E3 together with E2. The ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway is involved in photomorphogenesis, hormone regulation, floral homeosis, senescence, and pathogen defense (Suzuki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2002</xref>; Xie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2002</xref>; Hellmann and Estelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2002</xref>; Devoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2003</xref>). Previous studies suggest that ubiquitination may also play an important role in plant tolerance against various abiotic stresses. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene <italic>AtCHIP</italic> encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase structurally similar to the animal CHIP proteins, which is up-regulated by several stress conditions such as low and high temperatures. Overexpression of <italic>AtCHIP</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> confers more sensitivity to both low and high temperatures (Yan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>). PP2A appears to be ubiquitylated by AtCHIP in vitro and the activity of PP2A is increased in <italic>AtCHIP</italic>-overexpressing plants in the dark or under low-temperature conditions, suggesting that PP2A might be a substrate of AtCHIP (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis HOS1</italic> encodes a RING finger protein E3 ubiquitin ligase which exerts a negative control on cold response and regulates cold-responsive gene expression (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>; Ishitani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1998</xref>). The RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase SDIR1 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling. Overexpression of <italic>SDIR1</italic> leads to ABA hypersensitivity and enhanced drought tolerance through ABA-induced stomatal closure (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>). These studies suggest that ubiquitination plays an important role in stress responses in plants.</p><p>E2s were originally defined as proteins capable of accepting ubiquitin from an E1 through a thioester linkage via a cysteinyl-sulfhydryl group (Glickman and Ciechanover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>). The UBC domain also interacts with the E3 enzyme and, in some cases it also interacts with the substrate (Kalchman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1996</xref>). Many genes encoding the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme have been identified in eukaryotic organism. The yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) genome encodes 11 ubiquitin E2s and there are approximately 50 and 37 E2s in the human and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, respectively (Bachmair et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2001</xref>; Jiang and Beaudet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>; Kraft et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>). The <italic>RAD6</italic> gene in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> encodes a 172-amino acid, 20-kDa E2 enzyme (Ubc2) and is required for post-replication repair of UV-damaged DNA, induced mutagenesis, and sporulation (Reynolds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1985</xref>). Rad6 appears to have diverse functions since <italic>rad6</italic> mutants display a slow-growth phenotype, show defectiveness in DNA damage-induced mutagenesis and are sensitive to killing by various DNA-damaging agents such as UV, ionizing radiations, and alkylating agents. rad6 diploids are also deficient in sporulation (Prakash et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1993</xref>). Mouse <italic>HR6A</italic> encodes an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme highly homologous to RAD6 and <italic>mHR6A</italic>-deficient cells appear to have normal DNA damage resistance properties, but <italic>mHR6A</italic> knockout male and female mice display a small decrease in body weight (Roest et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>). AtUBC2 of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> encodes a structural homologue of the <italic>RAD6</italic> gene of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> with approximately 65% amino acid identity and it can partially rescue the UV sensitivity and reduced growth rate of rad6 mutants at elevated temperatures (Zwirn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1997</xref>). The <italic>Atubc1-1</italic> and <italic>Atubc2-1</italic> double mutant shows a dramatically reduced number of rosette leaves, an early-flowering phenotype, and reduced transcript levels of a set of floral repressor genes, including Flowering Locus C (FLC), MADS Associated Flowering 4 (MAF4) and MAF5 (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>).</p><p>Although E2s have been studied in regulating various aspects of plant growth, development, and cell process in eukaryotes, little is known about its role in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we identified a soybean gene <italic>GmUBC2</italic> encoding an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Expression of <italic>GmUBC2</italic> is induced by salt and drought stress. Our molecular and physiological results suggest that <italic>GmUBC2</italic> is involved in the regulation of ion homeostasis, osmolyte synthesis, oxidative stress and abiotic stress responses. We demonstrate that overexpression of <italic>GmUBC2</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> conferred improved salt and drought tolerance by regulating the expression of a set of important stress-responsive genes.</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Isolation of <italic>GmUBC2</italic></title><p>Seeds of soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> L.

A full-length cDNA encoding an Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 was selected for further study. This gene was named <italic>GmUBC2</italic> due to its homology to other E2 genes. <italic>GmUBC2</italic> encodes a polypeptide of 152 amino acid residues and shares high sequence similarities with AtUBC2 from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Zwirn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1997</xref>), Ube2a from <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (Roest et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>), RAD6 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Reynolds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1985</xref>), and HR6A from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (Koken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1991</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). As predicted by the Scanprosite program, GmUBC2 contains a conserved active-site cysteine required for E2 enzymes catalytic activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Although the cysteine residue of canonical E2 catalytic site is invariant in many E2 enzymes, it is replaced by other amino acid residues in some ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme variant (UEV) proteins (Koonin and Abagyan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1997</xref>; Sancho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1998</xref>; Thomson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1998</xref>).

Previous phylogenetic analyses of UBC proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> have classified AtUBC1 and AtUBC2 as well as AtUBC3 together with RAD6 (also named ScUBC2) and HsUBC2 as members of group III (Kraft et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>). GmUBC2 has high sequence similarity to AtUBC2 and RAD6 and phylogenetically clusters together with AtUBC2 and RAD6. These sequence analyses suggest that GmUBC2 could be an active ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme as RAD6 and AtUBC2, further biochemical analysis is needed to further confirm whether GmUBC2 binds ubiquitin via a thiol ester linkage. Previous studies have demonstrated that AtUBC1 and AtUBC2 have E2 activity in vitro (Sullivan and Vierstra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1993</xref>), that AtUBC2 could rescue the UV-sensitive phenotype of the yeast rad6 mutant (Zwirn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1997</xref>), and that AtUBC1 and AtUBC2 have redundant functions in suppression of flowering (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>). Here, we showed that <italic>GmUBC2</italic> played an important role in salt and drought stress responses by regulating stress-responsive genes.</p><p>Accumulating evidences suggest that ubiquitination may play an important role in plant tolerance against abiotic stresses (Yan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>; Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>; Lopez-Molina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>; Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>; Stone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2006</xref>). The mRNA level of <italic>GmUBC2</italic> increased after exposure to salt and drought stress, suggesting that <italic>GmUBC2</italic> might be involved in plant tolerance against salt and drought stress. As a prove-of-concept study, we overexpressed the <italic>GmUBC2</italic> under the control of 35S CaMV promoter to examine its role in salt and drought stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> given the technical difficulty of transforming soybean. The transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants were more tolerant to NaCl during the seedling stage. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, seedlings expressing <italic>GmUBC2</italic> grew in MS medium containing 200&#x000a0;mM NaCl for 7&#x000a0;days exhibited higher survival rates compared with the control plants. The root length of transgenic seedlings is longer than that of WT seedlings (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In addition, our data indicated that plants overexpressing <italic>GmUBC2</italic> were more tolerant to drought compared to control plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These results strongly suggest that GmUBC2 is a positive regulator of salt and drought tolerance.</p><p>Our gene expression analysis suggests that GmUBC2 is involved in the regulation of ion homeostasis, osmolyte synthesis, and oxidative stress responses. We found that expression of several abiotic stress-related genes increased in the <italic>GmUBC2</italic> overexpressing plants under normal growth conditions. Among them, the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter AtNHX1 is a vacuolar antiporter (Gaxiola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1999</xref>) and represents a mechanism of sequestering Na<sup>+</sup> into vacuoles to adapt to higher NaCl condition in plants (Apse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1999</xref>). We also found that the Na<sup>+</sup> content in transgenic plants is higher than that in control plants. Consistent with our observation, overexpressing plants of <italic>AtNHX1</italic> or a rice vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter exhibited higher vacuolar antiport activity and Na<sup>+</sup> content than WT plants under high NaCl condition (Apse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1999</xref>; Fukuda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>). Our result strongly suggests that GmUBC2 enhances salt tolerance by affecting <italic>AtNHX1</italic> expression to sequester Na<sup>+</sup> in plants. In addition, we observed an increased expression of the anion channel gene <italic>AtCLCa</italic> in the <italic>35S-GmUBC2</italic> plants. The tonoplast-localized <italic>AtCLCa</italic> is able to accumulate specific nitrate in the vacuole and behaves as a NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (Angeli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>). Together, our results suggested that GmUBC2 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in plant cells.</p><p>Salt and drought stress leads to accumulation of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Borsani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2001</xref>). The excessive production of ROS such as superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and hydroxyl radicals (OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) may disturb cellular redox homeostasis, leading to oxidative injuries. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) belongs to the enzymatic defense system against ROS and catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The increased expression level of <italic>AtCCS</italic> suggests that SOD activity may increase in <italic>35S-GmUBC2</italic> plants. Indeed, we observed a higher SOD activity in transgenic plants compared with control plants with or without NaCl treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), suggesting that GmUBC2 regulates SOD activity to scavenge ROS and is involved in oxidative stress responses.</p><p>Proline is one of the osmoprotecting molecules (osmolytes), which accumulates in plants in response to water stress and salinity. Correlations between proline accumulation and osmotic stress responses indicate that proline also plays a role as osmoprotectant in higher plants (Yoshiba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1995</xref>; Martinez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1995</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the expression levels of <italic>P5CS1</italic> increased significantly in <italic>35S-GmUBC2</italic> plants compared to WT plants. <italic>P5CS1</italic> encodes a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of Pro (Strizhov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1997</xref>). Consistent with this, the level of proline content was higher in the <italic>35S-GmUBC2</italic> transgenic plants under stress-growing conditions. Our results suggest that GmUBC2 may play an important role in the synthesis of osmolytes to protect plants from water deficit.</p><p>Many abiotic-stress-inducible genes are controlled by ABA, but some are not, which indicates that both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent regulatory systems are involved in stress-responsive gene expression. The ABA-dependent signaling pathway is mediated mainly by two types of transcription factors: one is ABRE-binding factors (ABFs); the other is the transcription factor <italic>AtMYC,</italic> which activates the expression of <italic>RD22</italic> genes (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2005</xref>). Although the <italic>P5CS1</italic> gene responsive to salinity, drought, and ABA was affected in <italic>35S-GmUBC2</italic> transgenic plants, the expressions of <italic>ABF3</italic>, <italic>ABF4</italic> and <italic>AtMYC2</italic>, and some of their target genes (such as <italic>RD22</italic>), were not affected in <italic>35S-GmUBC2</italic> plants (data not shown). A substantial number of studies have reported that overexpression of genes in the ABA signal pathway such as ABF3, ABF4, AtMYC2 and SDIR1, confer several ABA- or stress-associated phenotypes in transgenic plants, such as ABA hypersensitivity, sugar hypersensitivity, salt sensitivity and enhanced drought tolerance (Kang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2002</xref>; Abe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>). However, <italic>35S-GmUBC2</italic> transgenic plants were insensitive to various ABA concentrations (data not shown) and had enhanced tolerance to salt stress at seedling stages (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In addition, two genes of ABA-independent signaling pathway regulated by DREB2A, <italic>Rd29b,</italic> and <italic>DREB2A</italic> (Sakuma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>), showed no significant changes in <italic>35S-GmUBC2</italic> plants. Therefore, our results suggest that GmUBC2 could be involved in ABA-independent signaling pathway in the response to dehydration stress. However, it is also possible that the expressed levels of <italic>GmUBC2</italic> in <italic>35S-GmUBC2</italic> lines might not be enough to trigger the expression of various ABA-responsive genes even though GmUBC2 could be involved in ABA-dependent pathway. Further studies are required to definitely resolve this issue.</p><p>In conclusion, our molecular and physiological data suggest that GmUBC2 may act as an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to regulate protein degradation and abiotic stress responses. Identification and functional characterization of the substrate proteins will aid in the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of ubiquitination-proteasome pathway in abiotic stress responses in plants.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the State High-tech (863) (No.2006AA100104, No.2006AA10B1Z3, No.2006AA10Z1F1); National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.30490251, No.30671310, No.30490250 and No.30471096), the State Key Basic Research and Development Plan of China (973) (No.2004CB117203), National Key Technologies R&#x00026;D Program in the 11th Five-Year Plan (No.2006BAD13B05).
