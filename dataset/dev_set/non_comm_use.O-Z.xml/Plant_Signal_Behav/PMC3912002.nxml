Our results establish that water stress affects redox status differently in these two compartments, depending on phenotype and leaf age, furthermore we conclude that ascorbate plays a pivotal role in mediating redox status homeostasis and that Col-0 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> subjected to water stress increase the synthesis of ascorbate suggesting that ascorbate may play a role in buffering changes in redox status in the mitochondria and the cytosol, with the presumed buffering capacity of ascorbate being more noticeable in young compared with mature leaves. Re-watering of water-stressed plants was paralleled by a return of both the redox status and ascorbate to the levels of well-watered plants. In contrast to the effects of water stress on ascorbate levels, there were no significant changes in the levels of glutathione, thereby suggesting that the regeneration and increase in ascorbate in water-stressed plants may occur by other processes in addition to the regeneration of ascorbate via the glutathione. Under water stress in <italic>vtc2</italic> lines it was observed stronger differences in redox status in relation to leaf age, than due to water stress conditions compared with Col-0 plants. In the <italic>vtc2</italic> an increase in DHA was observed in water-stressed plants.

Thus, knowledge of the location of where redox changes occur, and their kinetics and magnitude, is crucial to understanding the responses of plants to environmental stress. The expression of reduction-oxidation green fluorescent proteins (roGFP1) in plants has become a useful tool as it provides in vivo direct measurements of redox status over time and in different intracellular locations. Using this technique/approach, it has been established that water deficit can induce redox changes in the plant cell cytosolic matrix, external to the organelles.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> However, because organelles, especially the mitochondria, are sensitive to redox perturbations,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> we concluded that measuring the redox status of the mitochondria, might lead to a deeper understanding of the effects of drought stress.</p><p>Redox systems show a high plasticity, with redox homeostasis in plants regulated primarily by antioxidants, such as ascorbate and glutathione,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> which may act, or not, in a compensatory manner.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> In the ascorbate-glutathione pathway, reduced glutathione (GSH) regenerates ascorbate (AsA), by reducing dehydroascorbate (DHA), either chemically or via dehydroascorbate reductase enzymes (DHRA). However, AsA regeneration may be independent of GSH, since the DHRA pathway is only one of several routes for GSH oxidation. Plant cells are able to maintain very high cytoplasmic AsA:DHA ratios, presumably because of efficient GSH-independent pathways for AsA regeneration.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Moreover, in the intracellular environment the overall abundance of reduced ascorbate may be more important in terms of regulation, than the AsA:DHA ratio. Under non-stressful conditions (e.g., well-watered plants) ascorbate and glutathione in young leaves are highly reduced, but they shift toward the oxidized forms under stress,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> altering the redox status and therefore the biological activities of target proteins. While changes in AsA:DHA ratio are frequently considered to be a redox status indicator, presently there are no clear mechanisms that directly link the AsA:DHA ratio to altered redox status and to the biological activities of target proteins. However, previous work using c-roGFP1 suggests that cytosolic redox status and AsA and DHA content are tightly regulated and linked.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants, such as the ascorbate-deficient mutant, <italic>vtc2</italic>, have provided unequivocal evidence that ascorbate is a multifunctional metabolite that is important in redox homeostasis and in signaling, as well as in development and defense reactions.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Indeed, ascorbate deficiency slows the growth of the shoot and the root,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and it has been reported that mutants deficient in asorbate (e.g., <italic>vtc2</italic>) attain less biomass.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> But surprisingly, <italic>vtc2</italic> mutants do not show oxidative stress and, the lack of AsA is not compensated by changes in the other major antioxidants, except by ascorbate peroxidase (APX).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>Whereas stresses such as drought may influence the amounts and the redox status of both ascorbate and glutathione, it is clear that other factors, such as plant age, may also be related to the forms and total content of both ascorbate and glutathione.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>Therefore, any assessment of the effects of drought stress on leaf redox status must also include a consideration of leaf/plant age.</p><p>Another consideration is that most studies of the influence of stress on redox status and antioxidants are performed in plants subjected to a short, intensive period of stress, without further assessing how the redox status adjusts following re-watering and recuperation of the plant, which would be similar to conditions plants encounter in the field. During the stress it is hypothesized that the plant needs to maintain tight control of both redox homeostasis during water stress and the reversible redox regulation of proteins by dithiol-disulfide exchange, as well as after re-watering.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p><p>In the current work we explore the role(s) of ascorbate in water-stressed plants and subsequent recovery, with a focus on redox status. Using the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant (<italic>vtc2</italic>) impaired in its capacity to synthesize ascorbic acid, we investigate the possibility of ascorbate mediating crosstalk between water stress and recovery. Additionally, because of an interaction between ascorbate and glutathione cycles in regulating overall redox status,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> we also assess biochemically changes in the glutathione (reduced/oxidized) pool, using these same mutants. Because earlier work has shown that <italic>vtc1</italic> mutants do not present symptoms of oxidative stress under non-stressed growth conditions, we consider the possibility that there are changes in glutathione levels which compensate for alterations in ascorbate levels, thereby potentially enhancing in ascorbate deficient mutants redox signaling through glutathione-dependent pathways.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p>Because redox status can differ in different cellular compartments, we also monitored the redox status in both the cytosol and mitochondria during water stress and subsequent re-watering. For this effort, we monitored in real time, dynamic changes in cytosol and mitochondria redox status in leaves of both wild-type and <italic>vtc2</italic> mutants transformed with one of the two forms of roGFP1; targeted to the cytosol (c-roGFP1), or targeted to mitochondria (m-roGFP1). The time course of leaf water relations, plant biomass, ascorbate levels and redox status and cytosolic as mitochondrial redox status were monitored. Also leaf ontogeny has been considered. From this work we have established that roGFP1 is sufficiently sensitive to visualize the redox dynamics at the physiological level in both the cytosol and mitochondria in plants subjected to water stress followed by recovery. Moreover, information on the possible crosstalk between subcellular redox status, coupled with measurements of the ascorbate and glutathione pools, in relation to leaf ontogeny, offer insights of the complexity of plant responses to water stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Relative water content of WW <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (wild-type and <italic>vtc2</italic> expressing ro-GFP1 in either the cytosol or mitochondria) was maintained between 80% and 92% during the duration of the experiment.

In previous work,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> using c-roGFP1, we investigated the effects of water stress and recovery on cytosolic redox status in wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Because that earlier work showed significant changes in ascorbate (in both oxidized and reduced forms) with the onset of water stress, we wanted to explore further a presumed association of ascorbate with water stress. This prompted us to examine ascorbate biochemistry in an ascorbate-deficient mutant (<italic>vtc2</italic>) subjected to water stress. Moreover, because the ascorbate and glutathione cycles are so intimately coupled in the control of plant redox status,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> we also concluded that measurements of glutathione content could be informative in understanding homeostasis of cellular redox status in plants subjected to water stress.

Additionally, from this effort we confirmed both the accuracy and sensitivity of the roGFP1 biosensor as a reporter for variations in water-stress associated changes in redox potentials. Finally, we consider how these findings shed light on the regulation of the subcellular homeostasis of redox status.</p><sec><title>Water stress affects plant biomass</title><p>Water stress results in a reduction in biomass that becomes significantly different from WW plants in day 10 for the Col-0 but only after water recovery for <italic>vtc2</italic> line. During the water withholding, the total biomass for the <italic>vtc2</italic> line was identical for both the WW and WS plants. This suggests that a reduction in ascorbate levels in the <italic>vtc2</italic> mutant did not impair the ability of this line to respond to WS, at least up to day 18, following the same growth ratio as WW plants. Moreover, at day 24 the biomass for WS <italic>vtc2</italic> line is only 16% lower than for WS Col-0 and, again supporting the view that the reduced levels of ascorbate in <italic>vtc2</italic> possibly are not linked to the reduction in biomass due to WS. However, the fact that the biomass of the WW <italic>vtc2</italic> plants is significantly less at day 24 compared with the biomass of the WW Col-0 plants, suggests that a reduced level of ascorbate in WW <italic>vtc2</italic> plants is not without consequence and thereby points to a role for ascorbate in plant growth under non-stressed conditions.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>Effects of water stress on redox status differ depending on phenotype, leaf age and cellular compartment</title><p>Water stress affects the redox status differently in the Col-0 vs. the <italic>vtc2</italic> line. In the Col-0 line the most oxidized status of the mitochondria is reached 14 d after withholding water for both Y and M leaves, whereas in the <italic>vtc2</italic> mutant the mitochondria compartment was at its most oxidized just before re-watering (18 d after beginning to withhold water). On the other hand, cytosol redox values for the Col-0 line were the most oxidized just before re-watering and attained values of redox potential less negative (more oxidized) than mitochondria. Our results show that mitochondria on both Col-0 and <italic>vtc2</italic> lines are better buffered than are the cytosol. These results are in accordance with Jiang et al.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> who showed that mitochondria are much better than cytosol in buffering changes in redox potential</p><p>The redox status of the mitochondria compartment also appears related to leaf age, with younger leaves of both the Col-0 and <italic>vtc2</italic> lines consistently exhibiting a more reduced redox status than older, more mature leaves. But with regard to the redox status of the cytosol compartment, its relationship between leaf age is less pronounced. From this work we conclude that the mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments respond differently to WS, with regard to redox status.</p><p>Moreover, because no significant differences were seen in mitochondria redox potentials in young leaves between WW or WS, this again points to the high buffering capacity of mitochondria, especially in young leaves.</p><p>It is known that mitochondria are highly resistant to abiotic stress<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> which our work now suggests could be related to their high capacity of redox homeostasis. Additionally, because mitochondria can remain intact until the last stages of senescence<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and this could explain our observation in WS mature leaves mitochondria remain more reduced than the cytosol.</p><p>In young leaves of WW plants (Col-0 and <italic>vtc2</italic>), there are no significant differences in redox status for the duration of the experiment at the mitochondria. Because mature leaves of WW plants tend to be more oxidized throughout the experiment, this increase in ROS could underlie the leaf senescence process.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Next, we consider changes in redox status in relation to variations in the levels of ascorbate and glutathione.</p></sec><sec><title>WS-induced changes in ascorbate and glutathione</title><p>Both the oxidized and reduced forms, and total amounts, of ascorbate and glutathione change in response to WS. Most pronounced are changes in AsA and DHA in young leaves, and to a lesser extent, in mature leaves, after 14 d withholding water, with (total ascorbate peaking at day 18). Even after re-watering, AsA levels continue to rise (on day 19), though total measured ascorbate (oxidized and reduced forms) is somewhat less than on day 18. To some degree this same pattern is observed in the WS <italic>vtc2</italic> line with a peak at day 17, when, however, in young leaves reduced ascorbate is undetectable, but still with relatively high levels of DHA. This suggests that the prolonged WS efficiently causes oxidation of the reduced form (AsA) to DHA and/or negatively affects the regeneration of AsA. For WS <italic>vtc2</italic> plants, the ascorbate buffering could still have been just enough to buffer WS-induced redox changes. Alternatively, another mechanism, not related with the levels of ascorbate, may function to protect <italic>vtc2</italic> mutants from extensive changes in oxidative redox status. With re-watering the level of AsA increases (DHA levels remain unchanged compared with day 17), suggesting that WS may also affect AsA synthesis. In summary, while there are many subtle differences in AsA/DHA levels induced by WS, and linked to leaf age, the most pronounced effects on ascorbate levels under WS were observed in young leaves. In parallel, young leaves showed a more reduced redox potential than mature leaves. Moreover, the last steps of ascorbate biosynthesis are located in mitochondrial inner membrane<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> and thus the increase in ascorbate biosynthesis in Col-0 Y leaves would explain the low redox potential in mitochondria throughout WS treatment.</p><p>Unlike the situation for ascorbate, WS results in less significant, if any, changes in glutathione (GSH and GSSG). In both the Col-0 and the <italic>vtc2</italic> lines GSH and GSSG amounts remain relatively unchanged through day 18 and only increase after re-watering. This suggests that these plants do not rely on changes in GSH/GSSG to buffer WS, at least through day 18, and also that because re-watering results in an increase in total glutathione (notably in the young <italic>vtc2</italic> leaves), that glutathione synthesis may be impaired by prolonged water stress. Additionally, even in the ascorbate-deficient mutant, glutathione levels remain more or less unchanged in WS plants, pointing to the fact that no increase glutathione occurs to compensate for a reduction in ascorbate. In addition, though mitochondria appear to be heavily buffered by glutathione,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> the increasingly oxidized redox status, with the prolongation of WS, can be explained as a consequence of no change in GSH/GSSG levels. On the other hand, because changes in the redox status of the mitochondria (which start to become more reduced after day 14) parallel increases in ascorbate, this suggests that in the mitochondria ascorbate is the major redox buffering species. This view is supported by essentially no change in mitochondrial redox status in the ascorbate-deficient mutant.</p><p>The results observed in AsA levels in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0 line plants subjected to water stress and cultivated in a growth chamber cannot now be extrapolated in its totality to plants subjected to drought and growing under field conditions. Nevertheless, our results suggest that even in plants growing in natural conditions and subjected to a progressive water stress, that variations in the endogenous concentrations of AsA will likely be useful as stress markers, since plants resistant to drought generally show an increase in AsA levels.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>In summary, the results of measurements of ascorbate and glutathione accord well with the roGFP data. Most notable is the fact that the redox status of cytosol of WS Col-0 plants continues to become more oxidized with prolongation of WS, whereas the redox status of the mitochondria starts to become more reduced at about day 14. We therefore conclude that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> responds to WS by increasing the synthesis of ascorbate, which primarily buffers changes in the mitochondria. Second, WS appears not to result in a significant increase in glutathione synthesis (or in the amounts of GSH or GSSG). Thus, if ascorbate is the major redox-buffering species in water-stressed plants, and if its reduced form normally involves the glutathione cycle, then the increase in AsA/DHA in WS plants may occur via other reductants, in addition to GSH.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and water stress treatment</title><p>Seeds of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Columbia (Col) ecotype wild-type (Col-0) and the ascorbate deficient mutant (<italic>vtc2</italic>) were transformed with a redox-sensing green fluorescent protein [reduction-oxidation-sensitive green fluorescent protein] targeted either to the cytosol (c-roGFP1) or to mitochondria (m-roGFP1) using the floral dip method.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Selected seeds expressing c-roGFP1 and m-roGFP1 were surface sterilized and plated on MS agar medium under sterile conditions and then incubated for 4 d at 4&#x000b0;C whereupon they were transferred to a growth chamber.</p><p>At the stage of four true leaves the seedlings were transplanted to a substrate mixture of peat/perlite/vermiculite (3:1:1; v/v/v) and maintained in a growth chamber (8 h. photoperiod; PPFD, 110 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 23.5&#x000b0;C).
