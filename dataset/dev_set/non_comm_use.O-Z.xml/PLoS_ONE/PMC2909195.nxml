In addition to systemic and vertical transmission, cofeeding transmission has been proposed as an important route for the persistence of TBE-causing viruses. Because cofeeding transmission requires ticks to feed simultaneously, the timing of tick activity may be critical to pathogen persistence. Existing models of tick-borne diseases do not incorporate all transmission routes and tick seasonality. Our aim is to evaluate the influence of seasonality on the relative importance of different transmission routes by using a comprehensive mathematical model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We developed a stage-structured population model that includes tick seasonality and evaluated the relative importance of the transmission routes for pathogens with short infectious periods, in particular Powassan virus (POWV) and the related &#x0201c;deer tick virus,&#x0201d; emergent encephalitis-causing flaviviruses in North America. We used the next generation matrix method to calculate the basic reproductive ratio and performed elasticity analyses. We confirmed that cofeeding transmission is critically important for such pathogens to persist in seasonal tick populations over the reasonable range of parameter values. At higher but still plausible rates of vertical transmission, our model suggests that vertical transmission can strongly enhance pathogen prevalence when it operates in combination with cofeeding transmission.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our results demonstrate that the consistent prevalence of POWV observed in tick populations could be maintained by a combination of low vertical, intermediate cofeeding and high systemic transmission rates. When vertical transmission is weak, nymphal ticks support integral parts of the transmission cycle that are critical for maintaining the pathogen. We also extended the model to pathogens that cause chronic infections in hosts and found that cofeeding transmission could contribute to elevating prevalence even in these systems. Therefore, the common assumption that cofeeding transmission is not relevant in models of chronic host infection, such as Lyme disease, could lead to underestimating pathogen prevalence.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes thousands of human cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Europe and Asia every year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Sumilo1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Sss1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Mansfield1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Understanding the mechanisms driving POWV transmission, and ultimately its prevalence in ticks and risk to human health, requires a comprehensive examination of the complex interactions among the pathogen, the tick vector, and the host populations.</p><p>Several mechanisms may promote or hinder persistence of POWV in North America. Tick-borne flaviviruses typically have short infectious periods (about 2&#x02013;3 days) in mammalian hosts, limiting direct transmission from host to tick. Therefore, POWV infection of ticks by systemic transmission (transmission between host and tick via feeding on a viraemic, infectious host) seems much less efficient than for pathogens with longer or chronic infections such as <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Alternatively, a different form of horizontal transmission &#x02013; cofeeding transmission (or saliva-activated transmission) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Jones1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Nuttall1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> between infected and uninfected ticks feeding in close proximity on non-viraemic, including immune, hosts &#x02013; has been proposed as the key pathway that can sustain TBEV in ticks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Cofeeding transmission is potentially effective because ticks show aggregated distributions among host individuals such that 75&#x00025; of ticks feed on 20&#x00025; of hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, because (a) cofeeding transmission requires ticks to feed in close proximity on the same host and (b) tick activity is seasonal in temperate regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ostfeld1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph4">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, the timing of tick activity may be critical to the persistence of tick-borne flaviviruses. In addition, although limited evidence suggests that vertical transmission (transmission from adult female ticks to their eggs) is relatively inefficient (0.1&#x00025;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Costero1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph5">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, when coupled with the high fecundity of ticks (&#x0223c;2000 eggs per female), vertical transmission could significantly increase prevalence and/or support virus persistence in nature.</p><p>Evaluating the relative contribution of each mode of transmission to POWV persistence under the constraints of tick seasonality requires a theoretical framework that incorporates all potential mechanisms. However, previous models of tick-borne pathogens have investigated only subsets of the important factors outlined above. Tick seasonal life cycles have been incorporated into Lyme disease models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Proco1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Sandberg1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> but rarely into TBEV models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ogden1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Most Lyme disease models do not include cofeeding transmission because the infectious period in the host is so long that systemic transmission is assumed to serve as the major pathway. Ros&#x000e0; and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ros1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ros2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> have developed models for TBEV including cofeeding transmission but did not include tick seasonality, which is a distinct feature of the sheep tick (<italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic>) in Europe as well as the black-legged tick (<italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>), an emergent vector of POWV in North America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ebel1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, existing models do not examine the interaction of cofeeding and vertical transmission. Ogden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ogden1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> developed a detailed model of tick-borne pathogen transmission in seasonal tick populations with systemic and cofeeding transmission, but failed to include vertical transmission. Randolph and colleagues have proposed that cofeeding transmission between larvae and nymphs (inter-cohort cofeeding transmission) is critically important and vertical transmission has an insignificant role in TBEV persistence in the sheep tick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph5">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph6">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. If vertical transmission is not important, overlap between cohorts of ticks must provide the critical link for the pathogen to be passed from one generation to the next via horizontal transmission.

The model by Ros&#x000e0; and Pugliese <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ros2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> was modified to also include the three transmission routes (vertical, cofeeding, and systemic). Our model is composed of monthly matrices representing population processes occurring in each month for different &#x0201c;types&#x0201d; of ticks and for the host species (a more detailed description of the model and the equations are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011745.s007">Supporting Information S1</xref>). The model computes density (per ha) for twelve types of ticks; three life stages (larvae, nymphs, adults), two feeding phases (fed or unfed), and two epidemiological conditions (susceptible or infected). If ticks fail to feed during the questing season, they are assumed to die from starvation. For the hosts, we assume no seasonal life cycle and a constant total population size. This is an over-simplification but we are focused on the effects of tick seasonality in this paper. For the competent host (able to carry and transmit the pathogen, denoted as H<sub>1</sub>), the density of susceptible, infected, or recovered types changes over time as hosts become infected and recover from the infection. To accommodate the time scales of the host infectious period (2&#x02013;3 days), we approximate the monthly host dynamics using discrete-time equations derived from the integration of differential equations that describe the within-month infection, recovery, and mortality processes in the host population. The competent host is born uninfected, and infection only occurs after birth. The incompetent host (H<sub>2</sub>) does not develop viraemia and is represented as one constant state variable. We assume that infection with the pathogen does not affect feeding rates of ticks or demographic characteristics in ticks or hosts. Temporal dynamics of the populations from a representative simulation run is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011745.s001">Fig. S1</xref>.</p><p>We parameterized the model with values taken from the literature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0011745-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011745.s005">Table S1</xref> for literature sources). If available, we utilized studies with <italic>I. scapularis</italic>, but otherwise we used values for a closely related and widely studied European tick, <italic>I. ricinus</italic>. Parameter values related to pathogen transmission are mostly from laboratory studies, while many demographic parameters are estimated in field studies. Because transmission rates were measured in laboratory conditions, it is uncertain how well these values represent field conditions. To reflect this uncertainty, we vary the three transmission rates over plausible ranges based on current estimates. For cofeeding transmission, we considered the measured values as theoretical maxima (0.24 on recovered hosts and 0.72 on susceptible or infected hosts) due to the unnatural settings of the experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Labuda1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The two cofeeding transmission rates &#x02013; depending on the immunity status of the competent host &#x02013; are varied simultaneously by a tuning multiplier (between 0 and 1) and are expressed in the figures as fractions of the measured values (e.g., 0.5 on the axis corresponds to 0.12 for cofeeding transmission on recovered hosts and 0.36 on susceptible or infected hosts, before adjustments by aggregation factors). For vertical transmission, we used the value referred to in Danielov&#x000e1; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Danielova1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and also estimated a maximum possible value from the limited field data presented in their paper (4&#x02013;6 larvae out of 419 larvae caught&#x02014; 1&#x02013;1.4&#x00025; &#x02014; were potentially infected before their first blood meal).

Briefly, the next generation matrix contains the numbers of individuals that are infected by one infected individual of each type-at-birth during the time it is infectious. Types-at-birth refer, in our model, to ticks or H<sub>1</sub> hosts that become infected in one of the months they can become infected (&#x0201c;birth&#x0201d; of an infected). We label the types-at-birth as 1) ticks infected as an egg (via vertical transmission; row 1), 2) ticks infected as larvae (through their first blood meal; rows 2-5, August&#x02013;November), 3) ticks infected as nymphs (through their second blood meal; rows 6&#x02013;9, June&#x02013;September), and 4) systemically infectious competent hosts (rows 10&#x02013;15, June&#x02013;November). The types-at-birth of <italic>infecting</italic> individuals are the columns, and those of <italic>infected</italic> individuals are the rows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011745.s006">Table S2</xref>). For example, a larva infected in August (L8) could grow into an infected nymph (since larvae are infected upon feeding, the next opportunity to infect other individuals does not come until they feed next time as nymphs) and infect larvae in August or September, nymphs between June and September, H<sub>1</sub> hosts between June and September, and/or lay infected eggs. Since the elements of the matrix represent pathogen transmission between particular pairs of types, we can classify the elements into the three transmission routes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Hartemink1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Matser1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The nonzero elements in the first row, for instance, represent the number of infections from ticks to eggs, hence vertical transmission. Cofeeding transmission corresponds to the elements representing infections directly from ticks to ticks. The dominant eigenvalue of this matrix can be interpreted as R<sub>0</sub> with the property that, when R<sub>0</sub>&#x0003e;1, the disease can spread into a purely susceptible population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Diekmann1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To compute our next generation matrix, we introduce to the population at the &#x0201c;disease-free&#x0201d; stable-stage distribution one infected tick or host of one type-at-birth and calculate the number of newly infected individuals by type-at-birth. All newly infected individuals are immediately removed if the originally infected tick is to subsequently infect more secondary cases (to avoid including tertiary infections). We assumed that the infectiousness of ticks and hosts is independent of how they acquired the pathogen and distinguished 15 types-at-birth. For every month when ticks are actively searching a host, there is one type-at-birth for every tick life stage at which infection can be acquired. There is another type-at-birth for the competent host for each month they can be bitten by ticks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011745.s006">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>The next generation matrix, <bold>K</bold>, will be a 15&#x000d7;15 matrix.

Some of the elements are zero because not all types can infect all other types. Hosts cannot infect tick eggs and directly infect other hosts, for example. Since we assume adult ticks do not feed on the competent host, ticks infected during their second blood meal (i.e., nymphs) do not have an opportunity to infect other ticks except their own eggs. Because ticks infected during their first blood meal (i.e., larvae) feed and possibly infect other individuals only after they moult into nymphs, elements in columns 2&#x02013;5 corresponding to the months when no nymphs feed are zero.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Non-overlapping generations</title><p>To examine the effects of inter-cohort overlap (i.e., larvae and nymphs), we shift the feeding seasons of larvae (one month backward) and nymphs (one month forward) to remove the overlap between two generations.

The basic structure of the matrix is the same.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sensitivity and elasticity analyses</title><p>Another utility of the next generation matrix is the ease of computing sensitivity and elasticity values of the matrix elements and of the model parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Hartemink1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Matser1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Caswell1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Sensitivities quantify how R<sub>0</sub> changes in response to small changes in the value of a matrix element or a model parameter, while elasticities are normalized sensitivities and measure the proportional change in R<sub>0</sub> in response to a proportional change in an element or a parameter. Elasticity analysis on the next generation matrix quantifies the relative importance of transmission routes with respect to R<sub>0</sub> for a given set of parameter values. For matrix elements, the element-wise elasticities sum to unity and each elasticity value indicates the relative importance of a particular transmission route between two types-at-birth. Using this property, we can sum appropriate elements to calculate the relative importance of vertical, cofeeding, and systemic transmission. For model parameters, elasticity is a more convenient metric to assess sensitivity of R<sub>0</sub> to a small change in a parameter because input values of parameters can vary by orders of magnitude. We examined the cases with and without cohort overlap for two sets of vertical and cofeeding transmission rates: lower vertical and higher cofeeding transmission (Case 1) and higher vertical and lower cofeeding transmission (Case 2). We chose the vertical and cofeeding transmission rates so that the prevalence is roughly the same (except in the non-overlapping case with low vertical transmission).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>The effect of the three transmission routes on pathogen prevalence and R<sub>0</sub></title><p>The effect of each transmission route on prevalence and R<sub>0</sub> was assessed by turning off one route at a time and varying the rates of the others over plausible ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011745.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). The model outputs show that prevalence and R<sub>0</sub> are qualitatively in close agreement. One source of discrepancy is that prevalence reflects endemic conditions (i.e., some hosts are immune), while all secondary infections are removed in the R<sub>0</sub> calculation (i.e., all hosts are susceptible). In the absence of either vertical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) or systemic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), the pathogen persists in the tick population at or above the observed level of &#x0003e;0&#x02013;5&#x00025;, while in the absence of cofeeding transmission the pathogen cannot be maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). When cofeeding transmission is the only pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g002">Fig. 2A, C</xref> at zero on the horizontal axes), the pathogen can still be maintained at intermediate or higher cofeeding transmission rates. Although the pathogen can be sustained without vertical transmission, a small amount can act in synergy with cofeeding transmission to boost prevalence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). On the other hand, systemic transmission is of less importance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In summary, neither vertical nor systemic transmission alone can maintain the pathogen, but cofeeding transmission can. Cofeeding transmission is necessary and can be sufficient by itself to sustain the pathogen in the tick population.</p><fig id="pone-0011745-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0011745.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Pathogen prevalence in adult ticks in October with one route turned off at a time.</title><p>The figures in the top row show the cases when the two cohorts (larvae and nymphs) overlap, and the bottom row show the cases when they do not overlap: without vertical transmission (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0011745.e027.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0; A, D), without cofeeding transmission (all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0011745.e028.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>'s&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0; B, E), and without systemic transmission (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0011745.e029.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0011745.e030.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0; C, F).

The mechanisms that lead to stable perpetuation of tick-borne flaviviruses in nature have not been fully described and are poorly understood because measuring various transmission rates under field conditions is technically and logistically challenging. Therefore, dynamic models of relevant transmission systems are useful exploratory and predictive tools. We incorporated tick seasonality into a comprehensive epidemiological model to examine the relative importance of all proposed transmission routes and the effects of overlapping tick cohorts on pathogen persistence. Our results show that cofeeding transmission is critically important for POWV to persist over a reasonable range of vertical transmission rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). In the north-eastern and north central United States, where <italic>I. scapularis</italic> larvae and nymphs can overlap, resulting in some individuals from each stage feeding on the same animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ostfeld2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, cofeeding transmission alone can be a sufficient mechanism to maintain POWV at observed prevalences.</p><p>For a model to reasonably represent a robust tick-pathogen system, it should predict a sufficiently large region of the observed prevalence in the plausible parameter space. As we increased the systemic transmission rate to the observed level of 90&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ebel3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, the region of &#x0003e;0&#x02013;5&#x00025; prevalence becomes larger and occurs at intermediate cofeeding transmission rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). This suggests that the cofeeding transmission rate in the field must be moderately stable at intermediate levels and highlights that the cofeeding transmission rate is likely considerably lower than the measured rates from the laboratory experiments reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Labuda1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the model predicts that low, steady prevalence in tick-borne flaviviruses could be maintained by intermediate cofeeding and high systemic transmission rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). The result indicates that prevalence is relatively less sensitive to variation in the vertical transmission rate as long as the cofeeding transmission rate is stable at intermediate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). However, when the cofeeding transmission rate is high, an increase in the vertical transmission rate could elevate prevalence substantially. When tick cohorts do not overlap (i.e. larvae and nymphs do not cofeed), this region of the parameter space can lead to zero prevalence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Hence, this set of parameter values is also consistent with the explanation that intermittent patterns of TBEV occurrences are due to the &#x0201c;fragile&#x0201d; link between cofeeding larvae and nymphs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph6">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph8">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph9">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, which could be a result of either no overlap between cohorts, or larvae and nymphs feeding on different hosts.

However, observational data on the prevalence of POWV in nymphs does not exist. With the same parameter sets as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, the model predicts that prevalence of &#x0223c;5&#x00025; in adults corresponds to &#x0003c;&#x0223c;1&#x00025; prevalence in nymphs throughout their active season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Only a very small fraction of larvae are infected, well below 0.1&#x00025; (results not shown). Although the lower proportion of infected larval ticks ultimately corresponds to a larger absolute number of infected individuals, nymphal ticks are probably more likely to transmit POWV to humans due to more frequent contact. Indeed, the month of onset of most recent POWV cases corresponds to peak periods of nymphal <italic>I. scapularis</italic> activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Hinten1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggest that efforts to prevent human POWV infection, like those for other tick-borne infections, should focus on reducing contact between <italic>I. scapularis</italic> nymphs and humans.</p><p>The major aim of this paper was to understand how tick seasonality influences the relative importance of pathogen transmission routes. By focusing on tick seasonality, the main limitation of our model is that we assumed an average, constant host population density. It is known that rodent populations, in particular, fluctuate both inter- and intra-annually <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Lewellen1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

In our model, dilution effects can be caused by either high density of incompetent hosts or of competent hosts due to reduced cofeeding transmission efficiency by less aggregation of ticks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011745.s004">Fig. S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ros2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>). However, the effects of fluctuations in host density will largely depend on the relative timing of population peaks in ticks and hosts. Future studies should investigate how variations in host density might interact with tick seasonality to affect pathogen persistence.</p><p>Existing studies that examine models of tick-borne pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Proco1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ros2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Hartemink1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> rarely report predicted prevalence. Ogden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ogden1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> developed a model with tick seasonality and predicted prevalence of 6&#x02013;9&#x00025; in nymphal ticks for <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>, another pathogen with a relatively short infectivity period in the mouse host (14 days). Although their model does not include vertical transmission, the predicted prevalence is more or less comparable to ours (&#x0223c;1&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g005">Fig 5C</xref>) after roughly taking into account the difference in infectious period (14 vs. 3 days). However, if cofeeding transmission rates in the field are lower than the measured values from laboratory studies (and possibly than the values used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ogden1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>), our model predicts that vertical transmission plays an important role in the persistence of pathogens with short infectivity in mammalian hosts.

Both <italic>I. scapularis and I. ricinus</italic> are three-host ticks (ticks that feed on three hosts, one during each life stage), belong to the <italic>I. ricinus</italic> species complex, are closely related <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Fukunaga1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, and share similar ecology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Gray1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the model was parameterized mostly using values from <italic>I. scapularis</italic> studies, as far as we were able to compare, the parameter values are quite similar (e.g., compared to values used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Hartemink1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g006">Fig. 6</xref> sketches the major mechanisms of persistence suggested by our model. When cohorts with the vertical transmission rate at 0.1&#x00025; overlap, inter-cohort cofeeding transmission serves as the major route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>): the pathogen is transmitted from nymphs to larvae via cofeeding, the infected larvae become infected nymphs (via trans-stadial transmission), which then transmit the pathogen to the larvae of the next generation. In this scenario, nymphs become the integral part of the transmission process. With higher vertical transmission (1&#x00025;), in addition to the above route, the importance of the two intra-cohort cofeeding transmission routes increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Larvae and nymphs infected through these routes will feedback to other routes, reinforcing the entire cycle. Hence, when vertical transmission is higher, multiple feedback loops support pathogen persistence, which may make persistence more robust to external perturbations. When inter-cohort overlap is removed, the larva-nymph cofeeding route disappears, and the intra-cohort routes will maintain the pathogen with increased importance of the survival of the pathogen within ticks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). This figure signifies that vertical transmission is crucial for pathogen persistence when the overlap is removed; once the link from adults to larvae via vertical transmission is removed, the entire pathogen maintenance cycle will collapse.</p><fig id="pone-0011745-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0011745.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>The proposed major transmission paths based on the elasticity analysis.</title><p>The relative thickness of arrows qualitatively reflects the magnitudes of elasticity.

One view is that vertical transmission is negligible and cofeeding transmission between larvae and nymphs is the key mechanism for TBEV persistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph6">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The other view stresses the importance of vertical transmission and intra-cohort (i.e., larvae &#x02013; larvae) cofeeding transmission and deemphasizes the effect of inter-cohort cofeeding transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Danielova1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Vertical transmission and inter-cohort cofeeding are alternative trans-generational pathways of pathogen transmission. Our model indicates that which hypothesis is more plausible depends on the assumed value of vertical transmission and highlights the need for accurate measurements of vertical transmission rates under field conditions to evaluate the two propositions. One caveat is that the life history of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> can be more complex and could lead to more complex seasonal dynamics of the cohorts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Randolph4">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Gray1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Future modeling studies that investigate the significance of more complex seasonal cohort dynamics as well as more accurate measurements of transmission rates from field studies may be needed for understanding the relative importance of different transmission routes for pathogen persistence in the European tick populations.</p><p>Finally, if we extrapolate our analysis to pathogens with longer periods of host infectivity, we find that the elasticity value for host recovery rate (&#x003b3;) is not as important as we expected, at least close to the set of parameter values used. We initially thought that cofeeding transmission would not significantly contribute when host infectious periods are long, because pathogens would have plenty of opportunities to be transmitted via systemic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Richter1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. On the contrary, more detailed examination reveals that the contributions from cofeeding transmission to pathogen persistence are substantial even for infections with very long periods of infectiousness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Specifically, the model predicts that cofeeding transmission can substantially increase pathogen prevalence even when host recovery rate is set at a small value, although cofeeding transmission is no longer necessary for pathogen persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g008">Fig. 8A, B</xref>). To apply this to Lyme disease, which causes chronic infections in rodent hosts, we computed prevalence with a much higher value of vertical transmission, as it is apparently the only considerably different parameter value between Lyme disease and TBEV cases in the simulations in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Hartemink1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The results show that cofeeding transmission can still increase prevalence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011745-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). Reported prevalence for Lyme disease is typically around 0.4 (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Ebel2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>), suggesting that cofeeding transmission could be operating also in Lyme disease transmission cycles. Obviously, concrete conclusions require more rigorous examination and careful parameterization. At least, our model results question the common assumption that cofeeding transmission is unimportant in tick-borne pathogens causing long to chronic infectious periods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Richter1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0011745-Richter2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.
