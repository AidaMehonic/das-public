While the endpoints of aberrant silencing are known, i.e., promoter region DNA methylation and altered histone modifications, the triggers of silencing are not known. We used the tet-off system to test the hypothesis that a transient reduction in gene expression will sensitize a promoter to undergo epigenetic silencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The tet responsive promoter (<italic>P<sub>TRE</sub></italic>) was used to drive expression of the selectable human <italic>HPRT</italic> cDNA in independent transfectants of an <italic>Hprt</italic> deficient mouse cell line. In this system, high basal <italic>HPRT</italic> expression is greatly reduced when doxycycline (Dox) is added to the culture medium. Exposure of the <italic>P<sub>TRE</sub>-HPRT</italic> transfectants to Dox induced <italic>HPRT</italic> deficient clones in a time dependent manner. A molecular analysis demonstrated promoter region DNA methylation, loss of histone modifications associated with expression (i.e., H3 lysine 9 and 14 acetylation and lysine 4 methylation), and acquisition of the repressive histone modification H3 lysine 9 methylation. These changes, which are consistent with aberrant epigenetic silencing, were not present in the Dox-treated cultures, with the exception of reduced H3 lysine 14 acetylation. Silenced alleles readily reactivated spontaneously or after treatment of cells with inhibitors of histone deacetylation and/or DNA methylation, but re-silencing of reactivated alleles did not require a new round of Dox exposure. Inhibition of histone deacetylation inhibited both the induction of silencing and re-silencing, whereas inhibition of DNA methylation had no such effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This study demonstrates that a transient reduction in gene expression triggers a pathway for aberrant silencing in mammalian cells and identifies histone deacetylation as a critical early step in this process.

Like mutational events, aberrant silencing frequently inactivates tumor suppressor genes in both sporadic tumors and human cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Esteller1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike mutations, however, silencing is a stepwise process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Turker1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Yates1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> with potential for reversal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Mund1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations have led to research to identify the molecular changes that accompany silencing. Such changes include promoter region DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, histone methylation at specific residues (<italic>e.g.</italic> H3K9, H3K27), and densely packed nucleosomes that create a closed chromatin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Gronbaek1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a caveat is that these changes are most often documented at stably silenced alleles that were under continuous selective pressure within the tumor microenvironment for maintenance of the silenced state. Therefore, reported epigenetic modifications represent an ultimate endpoint and do not reveal how silencing initiates, nor do they reveal the order of epigenetic modifications that occur during the transition from active expression to stable silencing. Such information is required to create strategies to prevent the initiation or progression of aberrant epigenetic silencing.</p><p>Many models designed to examine initiation of silencing track normal epigenetic changes during development at imprinted genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Reik1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> or during X chromosome inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Erwin1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, but developmentally programmed silencing may progress differently than aberrant silencing occurring in cancer. Promoter DNA methylation is the most common modification associated with epigenetic silencing, and has previously been thought to play a causal role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Siegfried1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, but evidence is accumulating to suggest DNA methylation as a late step in the silencing process. For example, DNA methylation occurs after histone modifications for silenced, stably integrated transgenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Mutskov1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar progression of epigenetic modifications occurs for silencing of the endogenous tumor suppressor gene <italic>RASSF1A</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Strunnikova1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that silencing of an integrated <italic>Aprt</italic> transgene allows the spread of DNA methylation into a promoter region, which stabilizes the silenced transcriptional state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Yates1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Although DNA methylation has been the most common modification associated with cancer-related silencing, examples of epigenetic silencing occurring independent of DNA methylation show it is not an absolute requirement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Banelli1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Kondo1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively these data suggest that DNA methylation primarily functions to maintain and stabilize the silenced state and that other epigenetic processes are required to initiate silencing.</p><p>If DNA methylation is neither a required nor an initiating step for aberrant silencing, how is this process triggered? Recent studies suggest reduced expression as one possibility. For example, in ovarian cancer loss of the <italic>GATA6</italic> transcription factor results in reduced expression and subsequent epigenetic silencing of the downstream target <italic>Disabled-2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Caslini1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, inhibition of ER&#x003b1; (estrogen receptor &#x003b1;) signaling in breast cancer cell lines reduces expression and induces silencing of the downstream target gene, <italic>PR</italic> (progesterone receptor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Leu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These are two instances that involve loss of transcriptional activators, but evidence also exists that reducing expression by inappropriate recruitment of transcriptional repressors can lead to silencing. An inherited mutation in the <italic>DAPK1</italic> promoter apparently causes B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia by increased localization of a transcriptional repressor that reduces expression and correlates with silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Raval1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to altered signaling pathways, some environmental changes accompanying tumor progression also reduce gene expression, which could initiate silencing. For example, hypoxia. a common feature of tumor microenvironments, represses expression of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., <italic>E-CAD</italic>, <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>MLH1</italic>, and <italic>RUNX</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Krishnamachary1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Lee1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> frequently silenced in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Esteller1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Li1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Li2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the current study we have developed a system to directly test the hypothesis that a transient reduction in gene expression can sensitize a promoter to undergo epigenetic silencing.

Here we report results from an experimental system that allowed us to demonstrate that a reduction in gene expression can trigger epigenetic silencing.</p><p>Dox treatment reduces expression in the tet-off system by preventing association of the tTA activator protein with the promoter, but reduced expression is not equivalent to epigenetic silencing. For example, the Dox-treated cultures remained sensitive to TG while silenced clones are TG-resistant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004832.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). However, a small fraction of cells exposed to Dox exhibited <italic>HPRT</italic> levels that are reduced further, which provided TG-resistance, and the fraction of cells increases with longer durations of Dox exposure. The induced TG-resistance was also relatively stable because it did not require continued exposure to Dox. These observations demonstrate that the reduced expression in the presence of Dox sensitized some alleles to undergo epigenetic silencing, but was insufficient to confer TG-resistance by itself. All evidence obtained in these experiments supported the conclusion that Dox-induced TG-resistance was due to epigenetic silencing as opposed to mutational events. The best evidence was the ability of TG-resistant cells to reactivate expression and restore functional HPRT activity, which was evident by growth of the cells in AzHx media. Besides the nine different TG-resistant clones described in this paper, we examined an additional fifteen TG-resistant clones induced by Dox treatment. At least one characteristic of epigenetic silencing (i.e., TSA or 5-aza-dC induction of <italic>HPRT</italic> mRNA or reactivant cell clones) was measured in each of these TG-resistant clones. In total, all twenty-four of the examined Dox-induced clones were shown to have silenced <italic>P<sub>TRE</sub>-HPRT</italic> alleles. Additionally, the silencing frequencies induced by Dox treatment were orders of magnitude higher than that expected for <italic>HPRT</italic> inactivating mutations (&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>), and a previous study that characterized base-pair substitutions in the Dif-6 cells showed they do not have a mutator phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-ShinDarlak1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Dox treatment has also been used extensively in cell culture without having displayed mutagenic properties.</p><p>High-level promoter expression in the tet-off system occurs via localization of the tTA protein and activity of its VP16 activation domain; this domain promotes expression through recruitment of TBP, TFIIB, and the SAGA complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Hall1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Then reduced expression during Dox treatment likely results from losing recruitment of these factors. The resultant disruption in recruitment of the SAGA complex and its associated histone acetyltransferases may therefore cause the concurrent decrease in acetyl-K14 H3. In contrast, acetyl-K9 H3 did not decrease when gene expression was reduced by Dox treatment, which demonstrates that the acetylation state of K9 and K14 of H3 may be regulated independently. Previous studies have also observed acetylation at K9 H3 can remain high despite decreased gene expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Stirzaker1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Levels of the repressive histone modification dimethyl-K9 H3 remained relatively low during reduced expression in the presence of Dox, which is not surprising considering the continuing presence of acetyl-K9 H3 should prevent the addition of methyl groups at K9 H3. Hypoxic conditions have been reported to increase dimethyl-K9 H3 upon repression of the mouse <italic>Mlh1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Chen1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and human <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Lee1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

While reduced expression alone did not induce methylation of K9 H3 in our system, increased levels of dimethyl-K9 H3 were observed after alleles transitioned to the silenced state identified by TG-resistance.</p><p>Results provided by our experiments help establish specific distinctions between the states of transcriptional repression and epigenetic silencing. In our system epigenetic silencing was defined as <italic>HPRT</italic> expression that was reduced to levels that allowed growth in TG selection. Therefore, the most evident difference was that clones with silenced alleles were TG-resistant while cells growing in Dox remained sensitive to TG selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004832.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The molecular basis of this phenotypic difference was demonstrated by showing TG-resistant cells had lower levels of <italic>HPRT</italic> mRNA than cells treated with Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004832-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) and molecular changes associated with epigenetic silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004832-g004">Figs. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004832-g005">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004832.s002">S2</xref>). While the reduced expression after Dox treatment correlated with a loss of acetyl-K14 H3 at the <italic>P<sub>TRE</sub>-HPRT</italic> promoter, TG-resistance and epigenetic silencing correlated with additional molecular changes including DNA methylation, reduced methyl-K4 H3, loss of acetyl-K9 H3, and increased dimethyl-K9 H3 at the <italic>P<sub>TRE</sub>-HPRT</italic> promoter. Although increased DNA methylation was one of the molecular changes observed at silenced promoters in our system, DNA methylation was not required for the initiation of silencing because 5-aza-dC treatment had no effect on the frequency of silenced clones induced by Dox treatment. Evidence that the 5-aza-dC treatment used here was sufficient to inhibit DNA methylation was provided with experiments showing 5-aza-dC treatment induced reactivation of silenced <italic>P<sub>TRE</sub>-HPRT</italic> promoters that were hypermethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004832-g006">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004832.s003">S3</xref>). Additionally, bisulfite sequencing analysis showed <italic>HPRT</italic> silencing in the TG1 and TG2 cell lines did not require high levels of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004832-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast to inhibition of DNA methylation, inhibiting HDAC activity prevented most, but not all, of the Dox-dependent increase in <italic>HPRT</italic> silencing. This observation suggests the presence of two populations of silenced alleles at the end of the Dox treatment. One population would be silenced alleles that are readily reactivated by TSA treatment, and the second population would be alleles that are more stably silenced and fail to restore <italic>HPRT</italic> expression after TSA treatment. Presumably, the second population would have acquired additional repressive epigenetic modifications that cooperate with histone deacetylation to stabilize the silenced state.</p><p>A speculative model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004832-g009">Fig. 9</xref>) to explain the results obtained herein is that promoters with high transcriptional activity are resistant to silencing and are characterized by epigenetic modifications commonly associated with active expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004832-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>). After transcriptional activity decreases at the promoter, acetyl-K14 H3 levels are reduced, and the promoter is more susceptible to epigenetic silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004832-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>). Although decreased acetyl-K14 H3 alone is not sufficient to induce epigenetic silencing, loss of this modification could decrease protection of the promoter from epigenetic silencing. Similarly, histone H3 acetylation has been shown to establish a protective boundary against spreading of DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004832-Mutskov1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The transition from reduced expression to epigenetic silencing initiates with histone deacetylation based on the observations that acetyl-K9 H3 levels were low at silenced <italic>P<sub>TRE</sub>-HPRT</italic> promoters and inhibiting class I and II HDACs reduced the frequency of epigenetic silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004832-g009">Fig. 9C</xref>). Initially the silenced alleles are unstable and can be reactivated by TSA treatment, but as additional epigenetic modifications occur the silenced state stabilizes and is resistant to TSA treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004832-g009">Fig. 9D</xref>). We propose DNA methylation as a late step in epigenetic silencing because 5-aza-dC treatment did not affect the initiation of silencing. Although loss of methyl-K4 H3 is also shown as a secondary step, our results are not inconsistent with this loss being an early step in epigenetic silencing similar to loss of acetyl-K9 H3. While future experiments are required to test this model directly, aspects of it are consistent with prior observations.

Although temporary reactivation of tumor suppressor genes may be sufficient to induce anti-tumor effects, re-silencing would ensure that these effects are short-lived. Thus, it would be helpful to know if high frequency re-silencing reflects a lack of prolonged expression, or alternatively if silenced and reactivated alleles have a persistent memory of the silenced state. To distinguish these possibilities, we isolated subclones from cells with silenced <italic>P<sub>TRE</sub>-HPRT</italic> that spontaneously reactivated expression and used selection for <italic>HPRT</italic> to maintain the reactivated state for at least one month (&#x0223c;50 cell divisions).

Additionally, re-silencing did not require the Dox-mediated reduction in expression that was required for the initial silencing event. Thus, the memory of silencing was clearly persistent and likely reflects retention of epigenetic modifications.

In other words, we believe that the principle of reduced expression as a trigger for silencing will apply to <italic>bona fide</italic> mammalian promoters. Although our system utilized a non-mammalian promoter, endogenous levels of enzymes that control histone modifications and DNA methylation were responsible for the transition from repression to silencing.
