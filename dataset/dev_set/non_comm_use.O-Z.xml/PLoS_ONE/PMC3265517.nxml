Accordingly, several studies report positive genetic correlations between larval competitive ability and feeding rate in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; both become enhanced in populations evolving under larval crowding. Here, we report the experimental evolution of enhanced competitive ability in populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> previously maintained for 84 generations at low density on an extremely poor larval food. In contrast to previous studies, greater competitive ability was not associated with the evolution of higher feeding rate; if anything, the correlation between the two traits across lines tended to be negative. Thus, enhanced competitive ability may be favored by nutritional stress even when competition is not intense, and competitive ability may be decoupled from the rate of food consumption.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="4"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Food is often a limiting factor for animals and an object of intense competition. In particular, competition for a limited amount of high quality food is likely to favour monopolization of resources through territoriality or social dominance as well as faster feeding and development. However, malnutrition may also result from food being of poor quality even if available in large amount. This type of nutritional stress may favour different adaptations than competition for high-quality food, such as efficient food processing and utilization.</p><p>Adaptation to both types of nutritional stress has been addressed with experimental evolution in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where larvae in nature develop on ephemeral food patches of varying quality and often compete with other larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Atkinson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Nunney1">[2]</xref>. Experimental populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> maintained under high larval density on high-quality food have evolved accelerated development, faster growth and increased competitive ability for food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Mueller1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Santos1">[4]</xref>. This increased competitive ability, quantified as relative survival to adulthood of two strains competing for a small amount of food, appears to trade-off with lower energetic efficiency. This trade-off raises the question of whether greater competitive ability would also be favoured under nutritional stress resulting from low food quality rather than quantity, where the efficiency of food use might be more important than the scramble competition.</p><p>Here we address this question using six <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> populations adapted to chronic larval malnutrition as a result of being maintained for 84 generations under low density on an extremely poor larval food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Kolss1">[5]</xref>. Similar to populations adapted to larval crowding, these populations have evolved faster development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Kolss1">[5]</xref>. However, faster development does not automatically lead to competitive advantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Prasad1">[6]</xref>. Furthermore, in contrast to the crowding-adapted populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Mueller1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Santos1">[4]</xref>, these populations do not show faster growth than unselected controls under good food conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Vijendravarma1">[7]</xref>. The question of their competitive ability thus remains open. Larval competitive ability in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is thought to be mediated to a significant degree by a higher feeding rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Bakker1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Joshi1">[9]</xref>. Consistent with this, the experimental evolution of higher competitive ability in crowded populations has been coupled with an increase in larval feeding rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Santos1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Joshi1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Joshi2">[10]</xref>. Conversely, larvae from populations selected for faster development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Shakarad1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Rajamani1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Joshi3">[13]</xref> and parasitoid resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Fellowes1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Kraaijeveld1">[15]</xref> have evolved both lower larval competitive ability and lower rates of larval feeding. Finally, fast-feeding <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> larvae from a bi-directional selection experiment on larval feeding rate were better competitors than both slow-feeding larvae and unselected controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Burnet1">[16]</xref>. Under scramble competition for high-quality food, a high feeding rate allows the individual to obtain more food before it is consumed by competitors. However, a higher rate of food intake might also be favoured in the absence of competition as a way to compensate for low nutritional content of food. Therefore, we also test if larvae from the selected populations show a higher rate of food intake than controls, and if variation in food intake and competitive ability correlates across replicate populations within selection regimes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental evolution</title><p>Six populations of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (referred to as selected populations) were reared on poor larval food for 84 generations with time-to-emergence restricted to 14 days; six control populations were reared on standard food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Kolss1">[5]</xref>. Both regimes were maintained at 25&#x000b0;C, 70&#x00025; humidity and at a density of 200 eggs/30 ml food (also the conditions used in this study).

We thus use a newer dye-based method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Kaun1">[22]</xref> instead. Three bottles containing standard food and 200 eggs (collected over a 3 h period) were set up for each of the 12 populations. After 92 h of incubation, groups of 50 larvae were collected per bottle and allowed to feed on 50&#x00025; yeast paste coloured with 0.16&#x00025; Erioglaucine dye (FD&#x00026;C Blue No. 1, Sigma) for 15 minutes, in Petri-plates lined with agar. A fourth group of 50 larvae per population was collected from one of the three bottles at random, allowed to feed on uncolored yeast paste for 15 minutes and used to measure background OD. Each group of larvae was then washed twice in distilled water, placed in 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes with a few glass beads, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Larvae within each tube were homogenized in 250 &#x000b5;l distilled water and centrifuged at 13 g for 10 min; 225 &#x000b5;l of supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 ml tube containing 50 &#x000b5;l 100&#x00025; ethanol. Tubes were then vortexed for 30&#x000b7;seconds and re-centrifuged for 10&#x000b7;min. 225 &#x000b5;l of supernatant was centrifuged at 13 g for 5 min in a new tube and 150 &#x000b5;l of this supernatant was loaded into a 96-well crystal plate. The relative amount of dye ingested by each group was quantified as the optical density (OD) of the sample at 633 nm (Spectramax 190) with background OD of respective population subtracted. Additionally, from each bottle 10 more larvae were collected, washed, dried on paper towels, and weighed as a group to the nearest microgram on a Mettler MT5 balance to exclude differences in larval body size as a confounding factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The values of competitive index, feeding rate and larval weight for each replicate were analyzed with a mixed model ANOVA using JMP 8.0, where regime (selected or control) was a fixed factor and replicate population was a random factor nested within the regime.

For this we used a generalized linear model with lines nested within regimes, binomial error distribution and a logit link function.</p><p>An analysis of covariance using mean trait values for each population was performed to test if the feeding rate among populations co-varies with competitive ability.

Yet, this study shows that these selected populations have evolved a stronger ability to compete for a very limited amount of high-quality food, which represents a very different type of nutritional stress. Enhanced competitive ability in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has so far only been reported from populations evolved under crowded conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Mueller1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Santos1">[4]</xref>. In contrast, several other experimental selection regimes &#x02013; for fast development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Prasad1">[6]</xref>, resistance to pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Vijendravarma3">[19]</xref> and parasitoids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Fellowes1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Kraaijeveld1">[15]</xref>, or improved associative learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Mery1">[24]</xref> &#x02013; have led to a decrease in the competitive ability. Thus, our results are rather unexpected and suggest that the previously reported trade-off between competitive ability and energetic efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Santos1">[4]</xref> has been of little importance in our selected populations.</p><p>It remains an open question whether the improved competitive ability was directly under selection under the poor food regime, despite the low density, or whether it is a by-product of evolutionary changes in other traits. The selected populations have evolved a smaller critical size for pupation initiation and complete pupation at substantially smaller size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030650-Vijendravarma1">[7]</xref>, and so they would presumably need less energy and nutrients to survive to adulthood. However, this does not explain their higher competitive index &#x02013; they do not survive better in the competitive assays than the control populations. Rather, larvae from the selected populations exert stronger negative effects than controls on survival of the tester genotype. A potential explanation of this result would have been a higher rate of food consumption by larvae from the selected versus control populations, leaving less food for the tester larvae. However, the selected populations did not show consistently higher rates of food intake than controls, and the correlation among populations between food intake rate and competitive index tended to be negative. This is another unexpected result &#x02013; previous studies found a close association between feeding rate and competitive ability (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>).</p><p>We can thus only speculate about the mechanism of the stronger competitive impact of the larvae from the selected lines on the testers. The number of larvae surviving to adulthood did not differ between the selected and control populations. Nonetheless, among the larvae that did not survive, those from selected populations might have died later than those from the control populations. If so, the <italic>sepia</italic> larvae competing with larvae from a selected population would have transiently faced a larger number of competitors. However, other factors such as differences in foraging behaviour (e.g., the ability to find the best remaining microsites in the food paste), the time spent not feeding (e.g., wandering or moulting), toxicity or waste products or direct antagonistic interactions might have also contributed to this result.</p><p>Irrespective of the underlying mechanism, this study shows that a greater ability to compete for a limited amount of high-quality food may be favoured under chronic malnutrition at a rather low population density. Furthermore, it indicates that a higher competitive ability in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae can be decoupled from the rate of food intake. Finally, these results suggest that adaptive evolutionary change under some experimental regimes may be most readily apparent by examining effects on the fitness of competitors rather than that of the focal individuals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank A.
