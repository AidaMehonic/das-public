However, as there is no clinical sign of immune dysfunctions, the current challenge is to develop biomarkers that will help clinicians identify the patients that would benefit from immunotherapy and monitor its efficacy. Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of endotoxin tolerance (ET), a pivotal feature of sepsis-induced immunosuppression in monocytes, we identified using gene expression profiling by microarray a panel of transcripts associated with the development of ET which expression was restored after immunostimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;). These results were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Importantly, this short-list of markers was further evaluated in patients. Of these transcripts, six (TNFAIP6, FCN1, CXCL10, GBP1, CXCL5 and PID1) were differentially expressed in septic patients&#x02019; blood compared to healthy blood upon <italic>ex vivo</italic> LPS stimulation and were restored by IFN-&#x003b3;. In this study, by combining a microarray approach in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model and a validation in clinical samples, we identified a panel of six new transcripts that could be used for the identification of septic patients eligible for IFNg therapy. Along with the previously identified markers TNFa, IL10 and HLA-DRA, the potential value of these markers should now be evaluated in a larger cohort of patients. Upon favorable results, they could serve as stratification tools prior to immunostimulatory treatment and to monitor drug efficacy.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>GM, FV and AL were supported by the Hospices civils de Lyon.

Mortality remains high, ranging from 20% for sepsis to more than 50% for septic shock. More worrisome, a 75% increase in the incidence rate of severe sepsis has been observed over the past two decades, probably due to improved care of the elderly and to associated comorbidities in patients (cancer or diabetes for example) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Angus1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Angus2">[3]</xref>.</p><p>The traditional view of sepsis has been greatly challenged within the past few years and it is now becoming evident that septic patients rapidly present with features of marked immunosuppression.

Endotoxin tolerance (ET) is observed in cells that have been exposed to low concentration of endotoxin (e.g. Lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and that become transiently unresponsive to further challenge with endotoxin. Functionally, endotoxin-tolerant monocytes exhibit an increased phagocytic activity, impaired antigen presentation, decrease in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase in secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-TurrelDavin1">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Pena1">[19]</xref>.</p><p>In the current study, we took advantage of an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of ET to identify a panel of markers of response to IFNg treatment by gene expression profiling using microarrays.

Indeed, as our capacity to treat patients during the very first hours of shock has improved, many patients now survive this critical step only to die later in a state of immunosuppression. Consequently, immunostimulatory therapies constitute an innovative strategy that deserves to be assessed for the treatment of sepsis. IFN-&#x003b3; plays a major role in the biology of the monocyte/macrophage lineage by activating antimicrobial activity, increasing killing of intracellular pathogens, and antigen processing and presentation to lymphocytes through induction of MHC antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Young1">[21]</xref>. IFN-&#x003b3; represents therefore an interesting approach to rescue monocyte functions in sepsis. Indeed, encouraging preliminary studies with IFN-&#x003b3; have been described in sepsis or trauma patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Docke1">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Nalos1">[11]</xref>.

The validity of this concept was demonstrated by Docke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Docke1">[7]</xref> using monocytic HLA-DR expression as a stratification tool. Furthermore, flow cytometric measurement of HLA-DR has been shown to be a reliable biomarker for the prediction of death and nosocomial infections in sepsis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Landelle1">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Pachot2">[28]</xref> therefore reinforcing the idea that biomarkers of immunosuppression are useful. It remains however difficult to implement flow cytometric assays in large multicentered studies and in routine labs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Monneret3">[29]</xref>. Gene expression profiling however provides new perspectives as automated tests with standardized methodologies are available. Indeed, several mRNA biomarkers appear to be promising candidates as surrogate markers of sepsis-induced immunosuppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Pachot2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Pachot3">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Pachot4">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Our study highlights the potential of gene expression profiling at identifying potential biomarkers that will help us to recognize patients eligible for immunomodulatory therapies and monitor response to treatment. Using this bench to the beside approach by microarray, we identified a panel of 11 novel markers (4 tolerizable and 7 non-tolerizable) in addition to IL-10, TNFa and HLA-DRA whose expression was altered in tolerant mononuclear cells and reestablished upon adding IFN-&#x003b3;. We then validated those by qRT-PCR and therefore confirmed our microarray results. Most importantly, upon validation in clinic, our study led to the identification of six novel genes that could be used to follow response to IFN-&#x003b3; treatment in septic patients; 3 of those being tolerizable (TNFAIP6, GBP1 and CXCL-10) and 3 non-tolerizable (CXCL-5, FCN1 and PID1).</p><p>TNFAIP6 is known to be upregulated in response to many proinflammatory mediators (e.g. TNFa) and high levels of TNFAIP6 have been reported in the plasma of patients with bacterial sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Milner1">[34]</xref>. Indeed, it appears that TNFAIP6 is a very promising biomarker of response to IFN-&#x003b3; as its expression was lower in septic patients than in healthy but increased upon <italic>ex vivo</italic> treatment with IFN-&#x003b3;. Finally, monitoring the expression of both well know IFN-&#x003b3; inducible genes CXCL-10 and GBP1 appear to be promising as well.</p><p>CXCL-5 is a very potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and is an activator of CXCR2. It has been shown that the expression of CXCR2 is reduced on the cell surface of neutrophils and migratory response to the CXC chemokines is markedly suppressed in PMNs from patients with sepsis compared with normal PMNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Goodman1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-RiosSantos1">[36]</xref>. It remains to be determined if the effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on the transcription of CXCL-5 will be beneficial for sepsis patients.</p><p>FCN1 is a recognition molecule of the lectin complement pathway. The ficolin-1 gene is polymorphic, but the functional and clinical consequences are unknown. It has recently been shown that homozygosity for the alleles at positions &#x02212;542 and &#x02212;144 was significantly associated with fatal outcome in patients with systemic inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-MuntheFog1">[37]</xref>. Even if the role of Ficolin-1 in sepsis remains to be determined, it is associated with outcome in severe inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Cedzynski1">[38]</xref>. PID1 appears to be a promising biomarker as its expression was normalized upon addition of IFN-&#x003b3; in whole blood culture from septic patients. It has been implicated in glucose homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0068218-Zhang1">[39]</xref> but its role in the physiopathology of sepsis remains to de determined.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. The number of patients used to validate our markers remains small. The population was mainly composed of elderly people who tend to have more comorbidities and receive treatment that could impact the immune defects we observed. We however included patients with a limited number of comorbidities and excluded patients on high corticosteroid dose that are considered immunosuppressive (prednisone dose &#x0003e;10 mg/day). As this preliminary study was designed as a proof of concept study to show that RNA markers could serve as marker of immunosuppression and stratification tool for immunostimulatory treatment, larger studies involving higher number of patients are now warranted.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Development of immunosuppression early in the course of sepsis is well established and there is a growing interest for immunostimulatory treatments in those patients. However, because of patients&#x02019; heterogeneity, we can envision a growing need for biomarkers that will help us stratify patients prior to initiation of those therapies and monitor drug efficacy. In the present study we have identified a panel of 6 genes that are differentially expressed in septic patients upon LPS stimulation and whose expression is restored when adding IFN-&#x003b3;. The potential value of these newly identified markers along with previously known ones like TNFa, IL-10 and HLA-DRA should now be evaluated in a larger cohort of septic patients. Upon favorable results, we may hypothesize they could serve as a stratification tool prior to immunostimulatory treatment and to monitor drug efficacy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0068218.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>List of 113 transcripts differentially expressed between the three conditions: unstimulated, LPS unprimed and/or LPS primed.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0068218.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank H&#x000e9;l&#x000e8;ne Vallin, Nathalie Panel and Marion Provent (Clinical Research Center, Lyon-sud) for handling patient&#x02019;s inclusion and acquisition of clinical data.
