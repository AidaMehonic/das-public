Within recent years, AMPK has also been proposed as a potential target to attenuate insulin resistance, although the exact role of AMPK is not well understood. Here we hypothesized that mice lacking &#x003b1;2AMPK activity in muscle would be more susceptible to develop insulin resistance associated with ageing alone or in combination with high fat diet. Young (&#x0223c;4 month) or old (&#x0223c;18 month) wild type and muscle specific &#x003b1;2AMPK kinase-dead mice on chow diet as well as old mice on 17 weeks of high fat diet were studied for whole body glucose homeostasis (OGTT, ITT and HOMA-IR), insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle. We demonstrate that high fat diet in old mice results in impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin stimulated glucose uptake in both the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscle, coinciding with reduced insulin signaling at the level of Akt (pSer473 and pThr308), TBC1D1 (pThr590) and TBC1D4 (pThr642). In contrast to our hypothesis, the impact of ageing and high fat diet on insulin action was not worsened in mice lacking functional &#x003b1;2AMPK in muscle. It is concluded that &#x003b1;2AMPK deficiency in mouse skeletal muscle does not cause muscle insulin resistance in young and old mice and does not exacerbate obesity-induced insulin resistance in old mice suggesting that decreased &#x003b1;2AMPK activity does not increase susceptibility for insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Lundbaek Foundation, Denmark, The Danish Medical Research Council, Denmark, The Danish Agency of Science, Technology and Innovation, The Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, The Novo Nordisk Foundation, and the Danish Diabetes Association.

In this context, skeletal muscle is a critical organ constituting &#x0223c;40% of body weight and contributing the majority of whole body insulin-stimulated glucose disposal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-DeFronzo1">[1]</xref>. Insulin resistance, associated with high fat feeding or obesity, is believed to be the combined result of chronic low-grade inflammation and accumulation of bio-active lipid species within muscle. In turn, this leads to impairment of insulin signaling to GLUT4 translocation and subsequently insulin-stimulated glucose uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Hotamisligil1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Savage1">[3]</xref>. Consistent with a pathogenic role of intracellular lipid accumulation, genetically engineered mouse models with improved capacity for lipid oxidation in muscle are protected against adverse effects of high fat feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Bruce1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Choi1">[5]</xref>. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated in response to stimuli that increase the intracellular ratio of AMP/ATP, such as exercise, hypoxia, osmotic stress and ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Treebak1">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Richter1">[8]</xref>. AMPK is referred to as &#x0201c;a metabolic master-switch&#x0201d; due to its general ability to reduce ATP consuming anabolic processes while alternative pathways for ATP regeneration are stimulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Hardie2">[9]</xref>, including stimulation of lipid oxidation in muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Davies1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Merrill1">[11]</xref>. This has led to the speculation that AMPK activation may protect muscle from high fat feeding induced insulin resistance. To support this, Goodyear et al. demonstrated that overexpression of kinase dead &#x003b1;2AMPK in mice on a FVB mouse background (AMPK Ki), resulted in massive exacerbation of muscle insulin resistance in response to 30 weeks of high fat feeding, coinciding with an increase in muscle diacylglycerol content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Fujii1">[12]</xref>. Interestingly, the AMPK Ki mice on chow diet in that study also showed a tendency towards impaired insulin action (&#x0223c;50% reduction vs. wild type (WT), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.07) whereas normal insulin action has previously been reported in AMPK Ki mice after only 15 weeks of chow diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Fujii2">[13]</xref>. This suggests that acute lack of &#x003b1;2AMPK activation may not directly trigger impaired insulin action, but rather lack of &#x003b1;2AMPK activity over time leads to a muscle phenotype that is more susceptible for insulin resistance. This would also explain our previous observation that insulin resistance induced by 12 weeks high fat feeding was not exacerbated in young kinase dead &#x003b1;2AMPK mice on a C57BL/6J background (AMPK KD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Beck1">[14]</xref>.</p><p>In order to test this interpretation and firmly link AMPK with muscle insulin action, we here hypothesized that old AMPK KD mice would develop insulin resistance on a chow diet (as indicated by observations in AMPK Ki mice). Furthermore, we hypothesized that insulin resistance induced by high fat feeding would be exacerbated in old AMPK KD mice (in contrast to observations young AMPK KD mice).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Danish Animal Experimental Inspectorate (# 2012-15-2934-00310) in compliance with the European Convention for Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Scientific Purposes.

Furthermore, development of insulin resistance in response to high fat feeding was not exacerbated in old AMPK KD mice when compared to WT littermates. Using the same mouse strain, it was previously shown that high fat diet-induced insulin resistance is also not exacerbated in young AMPK KD mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Beck1">[14]</xref>, collectively supporting that functional AMPK is not protecting against development of high fat diet-induced insulin resistance in mouse muscle; at least not in AMPK KD mice on a C57BL/6J background.</p><p>Interestingly, both young and old AMPK KD mice on chow diet were slightly glucose intolerant, but had normal insulin tolerance, HOMA-IR values and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in isolated muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g002">2</xref>). In these mice the plasma insulin response during the OGTT was similar or lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) despite higher blood glucose levels raising the possibility that lack of muscle AMPK activity may influence pancreatic function. Previously, normal glucose tolerance (1 g/kg body wt, 6 hours fasting) has been observed in young (6&#x02013;9 weeks of age) AMPK KD mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Beck1">[14]</xref> whereas adult (36 weeks of age) mice were slightly glucose intolerant (2 g/kg body weight, 12 hours fasting) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Turdi1">[28]</xref>. Since glucose intolerance may be more easily masked at low glucose doses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Andrikopoulos1">[29]</xref>, the reason for these discrepancies likely relates to procedural differences. Furthermore, the apparent mildness of this metabolic phenotype in AMPK KD mice may further encumber experimental verification.</p><p>In the present study ageing per se did not result in development of insulin resistance as indicated by responses to OGTT, ITT and HOMA-IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Also, both insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were not impaired in muscle from old vs. young mice. Generally, aging is linked to insulin resistance in both humans and rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Escriva1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Manetta1">[31]</xref> and characterized by increased fat accumulation, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Broome1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Gupte1">[33]</xref>. In the present study, although body weight increased with age, metabolic characteristics (RER, VO<sub>2</sub>) and importantly body composition were not markedly altered. Thus, our results indirectly support an important role of excessive fat accumulation as a key contributing factor in the etiology of age-induced insulin resistance, as previously speculated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Escriva1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Gabriely1">[34]</xref>.</p><p>When old mice were placed on a high fat diet for 17 weeks they became insulin resistant both at the whole body level and in skeletal muscle, coinciding with a &#x0223c;30% increase in body weight but unaltered lean body mass (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062338-t001">Table 1</xref>). Despite excessive fat accumulation, these mice were normally glucose tolerant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), associated with a compensatory increase in circulating insulin concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As described, lack of functional AMPK did not exacerbate the detrimental effect of high fat feeding. If anything AMPK KD mice exhibited slightly improved (although not significant) HOMA-IR values and ITT response compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Curiously, these observations are in stark contrast to a study of high fat feeding in mice overexpressing inactive &#x003b1;2AMPK bred on a FVB mouse background (AMPK Ki) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Fujii1">[12]</xref>. In that study, high fat feeding led to a reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in WT mice, similar to our observations, whereas insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was abolished in AMPK Ki mice. Considering the implications of placing AMPK in the nexus of diet and insulin action, these contradicting observations deserve further consideration.</p><p>Despite different genetic approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Mu1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Fujii3">[35]</xref> both mouse strains overexpress a non-functional &#x003b1;2AMPK isoform that displaces endogenous &#x003b1;2AMPK and to some extent &#x003b1;1AMPK. As a result, in both mouse strains, basal &#x003b1;2AMPK activity is markedly reduced, and activation of &#x003b1;2AMPK in response to pharmacological activators, hypoxia or muscle contraction is almost completely abolished <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Fujii2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Mu1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Fujii3">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Maarbjerg1">[36]</xref>. Based on the similarities in AMPK dysfunction, in our view, a plausible explanation for the different adaptations to high fat dieting may relate to the differences in mouse strains wherein kinase dead AMPK is induced. As an indication, the FVB strain of mice have previously been characterized as being more resistant to development of high fat diet-induced insulin resistance than mice on a C57BL/6J background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Hu1">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, it is noteworthy, that in muscle from high fat fed AMPK Ki mice on a FVB background, reduced protein content of a range of proximal insulin signaling components are observed including the insulin receptor &#x003b2; subunit (&#x0223c;30%), IRS-1 (&#x0223c;50%) and Akt (&#x0223c;40%) when compared to WT or AMPK Ki mice on a chow diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Fujii1">[12]</xref>. Based on similar Akt2 protein content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g008">Figure 8E</xref>) and insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g006">6</xref>) in the present study, similar adaptations in AMPK KD mice on a C57BL/6J background apparently do not take place.</p><p>In contrast, it should be emphasized that in our model both SOL and EDL muscle are characterized by significant reductions of TRB-3 protein content independent of age and diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062338-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). TRB-3, the mammalian homolog of <italic>drosophila tribbles</italic>, is emerging as an important player in insulin signaling, by its capacity to bind to Akt and prevent phosphorylation in the activation loop (pSer473 and pThr308) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Du1">[38]</xref>. In LKB-1 KO mice, reduced TRB-3 protein content has been suggested as a critical adaptation improving insulin-stimulated glucose uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Koh1">[39]</xref> and also more recently, improved insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after exercise in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice have been associated with exercise-induced reductions in TRB-3 protein content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Matos1">[40]</xref>. The present study indicates a role of AMPK to regulate expression of TRB-3 although by yet undefined mechanisms in mouse muscle. Furthermore, reduced TRB-3 expression in our AMPK KD model may contribute to explaining the normal insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in our AMPK KD model.</p><p>Collectively, this study provides evidence that high fat diet-induced insulin resistance in mouse skeletal muscle on a C57BL/6J background is associated with impaired insulin signaling at the level of Akt and importantly also TBC1D4, providing a novel link between insulin signaling defects and impairments in control of GLUT4 translocation. In contrast to our hypothesis, the lack of functional AMPK did not influence insulin-stimulated glucose uptake with ageing or exacerbate insulin resistance after high fat feeding in old mice. Thus, based on elaborate studies of AMPK KD mice, the lack of &#x003b1;2AMPK activity in muscle (both oxidative and glycolytic) does not result in insulin resistance in neither lean nor obese, young or old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062338-Beck1">[14]</xref>, present study). This strongly suggests that in contrast to previously indicated, AMPK does not constitute a necessary protective component for normal insulin action in muscle.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We kindly thank Professor Carol MacKintosh (University of Dundee, UK) for providing invaluable reagents used in this study as well Prof. Morris J.
