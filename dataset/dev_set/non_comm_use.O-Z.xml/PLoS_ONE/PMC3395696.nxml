We hypothesize that blood vessels play an active role in cell-cell communications supporting islet survival and engraftment. To test this hypothesis and to uncouple endothelial cell (EC)-generated signaling stimuli from their nutritional and gas exchange functions, we developed three dimensional (3D) endothelial vessel networks in engineered pancreatic tissues prepared from islets, fibroblasts and ECs. The tri-culture setup, seeded on highly porous biocompatible polymeric scaffolds closely mimics the natural anatomical context of pancreatic vasculature. Enhanced islet survival correlating with formation of functional tube-like endothelial vessels was demonstrated. Addition of foreskin fibroblasts to islet-endothelial cultures promoted tube-like structure formation, which further supported islet survival as well as insulin secretion. Gene expression profiles of EC growth factors, extracellular matrix (ECM), morphogenes and differentiation markers were significantly different in 2D versus 3D culture systems and were further modified upon addition of fibroblasts. Implantation of prevascularized islets into diabetic mice promoted survival, integration and function of the engrafted engineered tissue, supporting the suggested role of ECs in islet survival. These findings present potential strategies for preparation of transplantable islets with increased survival prospects.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Islet transplantations have been attracting increasing attention in recent years, as they carry new hope for successful restoration of glycemic control in Type 1 diabetes patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Shapiro1">[1]</xref>. However, only moderate success has been achieved due to donor organ shortage and low islet allograft survival rates, increasing the number of islets required per procedure. One of the most likely reasons for the poor success rates relates to the avascular nature of islets grafts, following their collagenase-based purification and free transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Menger1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Lukinius1">[3]</xref>.

Thus, we hypothesize that the non-nutritional EC-stimulated signals may be paramount to <italic>in vitro</italic> culturing of islets for the purpose of boosting early graft infusion survival prospects. In this manner, ECs may be critical to enhancing success rates of islet-based therapy.</p><p>The present work aims to elucidate the nature of EC-islet interdependence, its reliance on the tissue microenvironment and its role in islet graft survival. To this end, advanced tissue-engineering techniques were applied to develop a novel three-dimentional (3D) multi-culture model comprised of pancreatic islets, ECs and fibroblasts in efforts to reconstruct vascularized pancreatic tissue <italic>ex vivo</italic>.

In addition, through such a culture system design, both ECs, which organize into tubular structures, and pancreatic tissue retain their natural architecture, allowing for a close look at the physiological interactions transpiring between the two cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Yoshitomi1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Zaret1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Mattsson2">[15]</xref>. Such cell culture conditions substantiated the hypothesized essential role of 3D vascular beds in enhancing both islet survival and physiological functioning. Implantation of 3D vascularized islet constructs into diabetic mice led to improved engraftment profiles and to significant reductions in blood glucose levels.

To further examine the impact of variant spatial organization of ECs on preservation of islet morphology and physiology, islet behavior on 2D ECM-coated plates was compared to that of those cultured on scaffolds. Samples were incubated for up to 4 weeks and observed every other day. Dramatic differences in both EC organization and islet viability were recorded between 2D and 3D culture systems. While round EC clusters and rings were observed in close interaction with islets grown in 2D co- and tri-cultures, configuration of 3D vessels was not supported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g002">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). In contrast, 3D multicellular cultures enabled ECs to form elongated, interconnecting tubes yielding vascular network-like structures, which surrounded the islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). In addition, islets grown in 3D multicellular cultures tripled the average lifetime compared to isles grown alone in the 3D culture, and doubled the average life time compared to islet cultured on scaffolds with HFFs only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>). The islets cultured in the 3D multicellular culture preserved their morphology even after 42 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>). While no significant role was attributed to HFFs when cultured alone with islets in 2D settings, in the 3D settings, on days 12&#x02013;17 they induced a 30&#x00025; improvement in islet survival (p&#x0003c;0.05) compared to islets cultured alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>).

Taken together, these data stress the importance of endothelial 3D vessel-like structures in islet survival.</p><p>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis performed on 3D scaffolds and 2D ECM-coated plates loaded with pancreatic islets alone, islets co-cultured with HFF, islets co-cultured with ECs or islets tri-cultured with fibroblasts and ECs further strengthened the above findings. Addition of HFF or ECs to the 2D culture led to a &#x02265;50-fold increase in insulin expression, when compared to islets cultured alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>) for 8 days. A similar increase in glucagon expression was observed for islet-EC 2D cultures, when compared to islets cultured alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, 3D scaffold islet cultures demonstrated a 252-fold increase in insulin expression in the presence of ECs and a 401-fold increase when grown in the tri-culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>). Significant upregulation of glucagon expression was also noted for the 3D tri-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). When comparing 2D to 3D cultures at 8 days post-seeding, a 169-fold increase in insulin and 28-fold increase in glucagon expression were observed in 3D tri-cultures versus their 2D equivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g003">Fig. 3c, d</xref>).

This multicellular culture system was expected to support and stabilize pancreatic tissue prepared <italic>ex vivo</italic> and to ultimately enhance islet cell viability and survival <italic>in vivo</italic>. The use of human- versus mouse-specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040741.s002">Table S1</xref>) and/or antibodies, facilitated differentiation of gene expression patterns and histological analysis in this mixed mouse/human tissue model.</p><p>The unique 3D culture design enabled self-assembly of ECs to lumen-containing vascular structures and upregulation of a number of known angiogenesis regulators. In parallel, distinct differences in islet survival rates were noted between islets cultured in the presence versus the absence of ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>), indicating their critical role in islet support, and substantiating the significant impact of their geometric configuration in pancreatic islet fate. From a functional angle, islets embedded in 3D vascularized scaffolds demonstrated enriched levels of insulin and glucagon gene expression, as well as other islet marker genes, when compared to the 2D vascular environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In parallel, an increase in c-peptide secretion was observed in these 3D tri-cultures. Of note, ECs from other sources, including MS1 (ATCC), were tested and gave similar results.</p><p>Overall, the modified gene expression profiles reported here suggest that ECs undergo substantial changes during 3D morphogenesis, especially with regard to ECM components and growth factors associated with tissue microenvironments, and presumably involved in generation and support of the lumen-like structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040741.s001">Fig. S1c</xref>). In addition, upregulation of the EPHA1 and RGS5 tyrosine kinases was recorded, and is suggested to have played a role in initiating the molecular control required for the prevascularization process. The islet &#x003b2;1 integrin subunit, which forms laminin receptors upon association with various &#x003b1;-integrin subunits and is required for the &#x003b2; cell response to EC laminins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Hallmann1">[22]</xref>, was dramatically upregulated, especially in 3D tri-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g005">Fig. 5a,c</xref>). Similarly, islet VEGF-A, associated with ECM arrangement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Park1">[23]</xref>, was upregulated in response to EC signals in the 3D model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g005">Fig. 5b</xref>).Experiments performed by the Lammert group, have demonstrated that during later embryonic development, delaminated &#x003b2;-cells aggregate to form islets expressing high levels of VEGF-A. In turn, these islets attract VEGFR2-expressing ECs, which form a vascular network within the islets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Nikolova1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Lammert1">[10]</xref>. These findings suggest that ECM synthesis occurs during the 3D vascularization process, and serves as a factor central to the survival and behavior of cultured islets.</p><p>Addition of HFF to the islet-EC 3D culture system correlated with self-organization of vascular networks, which highly influenced islet behavior and improved islet survival <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as graft infusion. We have previously shown that inclusion of fibroblasts in cultures designed to engineer tissue structures, supports fibroblast recruitment and differentiation into pericytes and smooth muscle (SM) cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Caspi1">[17]</xref>, which later form elongated endothelial tubular structures promoting tissue vascularization and maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Lesman1">[16]</xref>. In parallel, islet-ECs cultured with HFF in a 3D setting demonstrated dramatic changes in EC and HFF gene expression profiles, most prominently in ECM and growth factor-related genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040741.s001">Fig. S1a</xref>); changes of this nature were not observed in 2D cultures of identical cell mixtures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040741.s001">Fig. S1b</xref>). The EPHA1 and EPHA7 ephrin receptors were dramatically downregulated in all cases where HFFs were included in islet-EC cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040741.s001">Fig. S1a,b</xref>), suggesting that alternative regulatory mechanisms such as angiopietin receptors or VEGF receptors are involved in the endothelial-mesenchymal interaction. In parallel, HFFs significantly influenced islet viability and c-peptide secretion in 3D cultures, as well as islet gene expression in both 2D and 3D setups, even in the absence of ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040741.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). These data support earlier reports of fibroblast-generated FGF signaling as being directly responsible for stimulating mouse pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell protein activity, such as those of PC1/3 and glucokinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Heart1">[24]</xref>. In summary, the HFF-driven boost in islet viability reflects a potential role of mesenchymal cells in islet survival and function.</p><p>C-peptide has been reported to play an active role in preventing endothelial dysfunction under high glucose conditions by binding to specific cell membrane G-protein receptors of both fibroblasts and ECs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040741-Rigler1">[25]</xref>. In light of the results observed in the present study, we hypothesize that under high glucose concentrations part of the secreted c-peptide molecules are bound to the fibroblast and EC receptors, specifically inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B and other cellular factors involved in high glucose-induced vascular dysfunction.</p><p>Finally, blood glucose levels and histology results coupled with FITC-dextran fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040741-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), demonstrated vasculature-related promotion of implant integration <italic>in vivo</italic>, which led to increased blood perfusion at the implant site and improved engraftment. As hypothesized, prevascularization of implants supported graft-host anastomosis, and boosted neovascularization and angiogenesis processes at the implant site. Moreover, reduction in blood glucose levels was observed within 6 days and mouse survival rates were significantly lengthened.</p><p>Taken together, these findings stress the importance of 3D organization, as well as the role of endothelial vessel-like structures in maintaining islet morphology and survival both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, these findings support the notion that the islet vascular bed provides key survival signals to pancreatic hormone-producing cells even in the absence of blood flow. The reported data further encourage our long-term goal to design a defined synthetic microenvironment that will reduce the number of islets required for successful islet transplantations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Experimental procedures and animal care were performed in accordance with the National Research Council&#x02019;s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
