How the highly dynamic microtubules (MTs) are maintained in stable mitotic spindles is a key question to be answered. Motor and non-motor microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) have been reported to stabilize the dynamic spindle through crosslinking adjacent MTs. Mars, a novel MAP, is essential for the early development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Previous studies showed that Mars is required for maintaining an intact mitotic spindle but did not provide a molecular mechanism for this function. Here we show that Mars is able to stabilize the mitotic spindle <italic>in vivo</italic>.

In <italic>mars<sup>91</sup></italic> mutant embryos, the primary defect is the dissociation of centrosomes from the mitotic spindle and nuclear envelope. Since Mars is not localized on the centrosomes, we reasoned that Mars may be involved in the stabilization of the mitotic spindle. Tan and colleagues discovered that Mars is able to recruit protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) onto the spindle, promoting the dephosphorylation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transforming acidic coiled-coil (dTACC) protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060596-Tan1">[10]</xref>. However, TACC has not been reported to possess MT stabilizing activity on its own <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060596-Kinoshita1">[12]</xref>. How Mars contributes to the stabilization of the mitotic spindle is still unclear.</p><p>Here we show that Mars is able to stabilize mitotic spindles <italic>in vivo</italic>. This function is mainly mediated by its N-terminal region (aa 1&#x02013;430). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies show that an MBP fusion protein with the N-terminal half of Mars (MBP-N-Mars) is able to bind to MTs and to stimulate the crosslinking and bundling of MTs. Overexpression of the N-terminal half of Mars (GFP-N-Mars) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos caused narrowing of spindle poles and fusion of mitotic spindles, while overexpression of the C-terminal half of Mars (GFP-C-Mars) impaired proper assembly of the mitotic spindle and caused nuclear fusion. Rescue assays show that neither GFP-N-Mars nor GFP-C-Mars can rescue the lethality of <italic>mars<sup>91</sup></italic> mutant embryos. However, GFP-N-Mars is able to largely maintain the mitotic spindle morphology in the absence of endogenous Mars. The failure of GFP-N-Mars to rescue the embryonic lethality of the <italic>mars<sup>91</sup></italic> mutation is probably due to its excess of MT bundling activity, which may cause spindle fusion or narrowing of spindle poles, leading to detachment of centrosomes from the main spindle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of transgenic fly lines</title><p>Transgenic flies were generated using the phiC31 integrase system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060596-Bischof1">[13]</xref>.

We hypothesized that Mars may be involved in the structural stabilization of the mitotic spindle. To test this hypothesis, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> mitotic spindle stabilization assays. Wild type embryos and <italic>mars<sup>91</sup></italic> mutant embryos were mixed and treated with a low concentration of demecolcine, which partially depolymerized MTs from the mitotic spindles. In wild type embryos, around 80% of mitotic spindles were of abnormal morphology with split spindle poles and MT loss in between kinetochore fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060596-g001">Fig 1A, C</xref>). In <italic>mars<sup>91</sup></italic> mutant embryos, the defects were significantly enhanced.

Obviously, <italic>mars</italic> mutant embryos were much less resistant to the MT depolymerizing drug. We next asked if overexpression of Mars could enhance the resistance of the mitotic spindles to depolymerization. Embryos with a mild overexpression of GFP-Mars driven by GAL4 under control of the ubiquitous <italic>daughterless</italic> promoter were mixed with wild type embryos and treated with demecolcine as described above.

Compared with the known MT stabilizer, taxol, the stimulation was much faster and more efficient even at a much lower concentration (0.25 &#x000b5;M of MBP-N-Mars vs 3 &#x000b5;M of taxol). MBP-C-Mars was also tested in this assay and showed an OD<sub>340</sub> profile comparable to that of MBP protein, indicating that MBP-C-Mars cannot stimulate the assembly of MTs. To test whether the increase in the turbidity at 340 nm may eventually be caused by MT bundling, we performed a sedimentation assay after the assembly of MTs. In this assay, MBP-N-Mars (0.25 &#x000b5;M) was less efficient in sedimentation of tubulin than taxol. This finding points to a contribution of MT bundling to the high turbidity reading caused by incubation of MTs with MBP-N-Mars. However, 0.25 &#x000b5;M of MBP-N-Mars sedimented more MTs than 0.125 &#x000b5;M of N-Mars and 0.25 &#x000b5;M of C-Mars and MBP.</p><p>To further investigate whether the binding of MBP-N-Mars is able to stabilize MTs, we performed a MT dilution assay.

At low dilution factors (2x and 5x) the addition of MBP-N-Mars had no effect on the stability of MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060596-g002">Fig 2F</xref>). At higher dilution factors (20x and 50x) however, addition of MBP-N-Mars increased the amount of tubulin in the pellet by a factor of three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060596-g002">Fig 2F</xref>). This result provides additional evidence for MBP-N-Mars being able to stabilize MTs <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>To further investigate the details of MT stabilization by MBP-N-Mars, we did a MT bundling assay and observed the MTs by indirect immunofluorescence. MBP or MBP-N Mars was mixed with tubulin at 1:4 molar ratio. The mixture was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 min, followed by formaldehyde fixation and tubulin antibody staining. By fluorescence microscopy, numerous short thin MT fibers were found in the sample with MBP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060596-g002">Fig 2G</xref>, upper panel). Occasionally, a few long thin fibers were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060596-g002">Fig 2G</xref>, lower panel). By contrast, in the sample incubated with MBP-N-Mars, very few short and thin fibers were detected. Instead, long thick MT fibers with different widths were frequently observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060596-g002">Fig 2H</xref>, left and top right panels). Besides these thick fibers, another type of MT structure resembling a network was also found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060596-g002">Fig 2H</xref>, bottom right panel).

Only 2.8% of embryos hatched as larvae while the remaining 97.2% died during embryogenesis. In individual mitotic spindles, three highly correlated major defects were observed.

This effect may be due to the fact that GFP-N-Mars expression causes excess bundling of MTs at spindle poles, which may affect the interaction between spindle poles and centrosomes. However, close examination of individual mitotic spindles showed a certain extent of rescue with respect to spindle morphology by GFP-N-Mars.

Here we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical assays and <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic overexpression studies to investigate in detail the function of Mars. Our data clearly show that a fusion protein of MBP with the N-terminal region of Mars (MBP-N-Mars) is able to stabilize MTs by crosslinking adjacent MTs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Overexpression of GFP-N-Mars <italic>in vivo</italic> enhanced the resistance of mitotic spindles towards a MT depolymerizing drug, resulted in narrower spindle poles and impaired the dynamics of mitotic spindles, which confirms the MT stabilization function found <italic>in vitro</italic>. Upon overexpressing GFP-N-Mars, dissociation of centrosomes from mitotic spindles was often observed. Although we also observed a significant loss of endogenous Mars from mitotic spindles upon overexpression of GFP-N-Mars, we do not think that this is the reason for centrosome dissociation. Our data indicate that in <italic>mars</italic> mutant embryos, the mitotic spindles are not as stable as in wild type embryos. Once tension is generated, the centrosomes begin to dissociate from the mitotic spindle. However, in embryos overexpressing GFP-N-Mars, the mitotic spindles are very stable as shown by the in <italic>vivo</italic> mitotic spindle stabilization assay. This view is supported by the rare occurrence of monopolar spindles upon overexpression of GFP-N Mars, whereas more than 30% of the mitotic spindles from <italic>mars</italic> mutant embryos were monopolar. Because overexpression of GFP-N-Mars narrowed the spindle poles, it is likely that this effect reduced the area of interaction between spindle poles and centrosomes, resulting in the dissociation of centrosomes from the spindle.</p><p>By live imaging, we recorded the fusion of a pair of spindles in an embryo overexpressing GFP-N-Mars. Considering the ability of MBP-N-Mars to cross-link MTs <italic>in vitro</italic>, the mitotic spindle fusion may be caused by crosslinking MTs from adjacent spindles. From immunofluorescence studies of fixed embryos, we found that more than 10% of the spindles were tripolar. Obviously not all fusions events result in bipolar spindles, which can be explained by the geometry of the spindles when they first touch each other. A recent study on spindle fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060596-Gatlin1">[18]</xref> proposed that dynein-dependent pulling forces on overlapping polar MT arrays could drive spindle fusion in <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs. Whether dynein is also involved in the spindle fusions observed upon GFP-N-Mars overexpression remains to be investigated.</p><p>Overexpression of GFP-C-Mars in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos resulted in poorly organized mitotic spindles with lower MT density and unfocussed poles. The mechanism responsible for this phenotype is not clear at the moment. We found that both MBP-N-Mars and MBP-C-Mars can bind alpha/beta tubulin heterodimers <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown). Apparently, C-Mars shows a higher binding affinity towards tubulin heterodimers. Since C-Mars does not show MT binding ability <italic>in vivo</italic>, a high amount of GFP-C-Mars in the cytoplasm may sequester the tubulin heterodimers and interfere with the proper assembly of the mitotic spindle.</p><p>We noticed that GFP-N-Mars localized to the central spindle during anaphase, which is not the case for full length GFP-Mars, pointing to a function of the C-terminal region of Mars in preventing localization to the central spindle.

This raises the question as to the main function of Mars, MT stabilization through the N-terminal region or the promotion of dephosphorylation of dTACC through the C-terminal region? Our results show that the N-terminal region of Mars is able to stabilize MTs both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Though expression of GFP-N-Mars alone could not rescue the lethality of the <italic>mars<sup>91</sup></italic> mutant, the defective mitotic spindle morphology observed in <italic>mars<sup>91</sup></italic> was largely rescued.

However, we did not find dTACC protein associated with GFP-Mars, further questioning the relevance of dTACC dephosphorylation by Mars and PP1 for spindle integrity.

How the function of Mars is regulated by importin beta is an interesting question that needs further investigation.</p><p>In our previous study we proposed a functional homology between <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mars and mammalian NuMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060596-Zhang1">[11]</xref>. A recent study of NuMA in mouse embryogenesis found that after inactivation of NuMA, spindles initially formed with MTs focussed at centrosomes. However, subsequent to spindle assembly and upon generation of spindle forces, centrosome-spindle attachment was uncoupled. Kinetochore fibers defocussed and centrosomes failed to maintain and reestablish connection to the spindle.
