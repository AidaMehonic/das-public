Recently, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study showed that the neural activity ratios between V1 and FFA were constant as eccentricities increasing in central visual field. However, in wide visual field, the neural activity relationships between V1 and FFA or V1 and PPA are still unclear. In this work, using fMRI and wide-view present system, we tried to address this issue by measuring neural activities in V1, FFA and PPA for the images of faces and houses aligning in 4 eccentricities and 4 meridians. Then, we further calculated ratio relative to V1 (RRV1) as comparing the neural responses amplitudes in FFA or PPA with those in V1. We found V1, FFA, and PPA showed significant different neural activities to faces and houses in 3 dimensions of eccentricity, meridian, and region. Most importantly, the RRV1s in FFA and PPA also exhibited significant differences in 3 dimensions. In the dimension of eccentricity, both FFA and PPA showed smaller RRV1s at central position than those at peripheral positions. In meridian dimension, both FFA and PPA showed larger RRV1s at upper vertical positions than those at lower vertical positions. In the dimension of region, FFA had larger RRV1s than PPA. We proposed that these differential RRV1s indicated FFA and PPA might have different processing strategies for encoding the wide field visual information from V1. These different processing strategies might depend on the retinal position at which faces or houses are typically observed in daily life. We posited a role of experience in shaping the information processing strategies in the ventral visual cortex.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was partially supported by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B), Grant number: 25303013, by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A), Grant number: 24686034, by JSPS and VINNOVA under the Japan-Sweden Research Cooperative Program, and by Grant-in-Aids for strategic research promotion by Okayama University.

The visual information from retinal ganglion cells is eventually processed in the visual cortex. In the hierarchy of visual cortical areas, the primary visual cortex (V1) is essential for visual information processing, as most or all of the input to the higher cortical areas passes through V1. A number of strategies are used for efficient information processing within this hierarchy, including linear and nonlinear filtering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Felleman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-VanEssen1">[2]</xref>. These strategies are used with the aim of creating different compact visual and functional representations in the organization of the visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Downing1">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Wandell2">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The human visual system is divided into central and peripheral vision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Martin1">[7]</xref>. The visual system seems to represent central stimuli with a fair degree of fidelity, but it more crudely encodes stimuli in peripheral field. Even with such imprecise encoding, the visual stimuli from our peripheral vision are nonetheless important in determining eye movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Balas1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Rosenholtz1">[9]</xref> and in object-motion perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Fujimoto1">[10]</xref>, for example. Understanding the information available to the visual system in the peripheral visual field is the key to understanding our visual capabilities and limitations. Despite the importance of peripheral vision, there is little understanding of the information available to the visual system and of visual representation. Peripheral vision has mostly been characterized in terms of the reductions in resolution or contrast sensitivity as the eccentricity increasing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Thibos1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Simmons1">[12]</xref>.</p><p>In the hierarchy of visual cortical areas, the ventral and lateral occipital-temporal cortex is responsible for the high-level visual object processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Wandell1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-NormanHaignere1">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Malach1">[15]</xref>.

In the ventral visual cortex, the lateral regions, such as FFA and VWFA, represent foveal eccentricities and the medial regions, such as PPA, represent peripheral eccentricities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Hasson1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Levy1">[23]</xref>. Since the discovery of central-peripheral organization, more differences have been found in these object-selective areas. For instance, FFA and LOC show a greater magnitude neural responses to lower field images than to upper field images <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Stephan1">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Yue1">[26]</xref>, whereas PPA shows a significantly greater magnitude neural responses to upper field images than to lower field images <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Schwarzlose1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Golomb1">[27]</xref>. These differences in the high-order, category-selective areas imply uniform processing of objects at these different positions. However, Yue and his colleagues assumed that FFA only had a neural response to the local contrast corrected by the function of V1 and did not include any additional face-selective components in central visual field. They stated that the neural activity ratios between V1 and FFA were constant as the eccentricities increasing in central visual field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Yue1">[26]</xref>. However, in wide visual field, the neural activity relationships between V1 and the ventral category-selective areas (FFA and PPA) are still unclear.</p><p>Here, we tried to address this issue by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and wide-view presentation system with up to 60&#x000b0; of eccentricity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-HaxbyJames1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Wu1">[28]</xref>.

V1 and the ventral category-selective areas (FFA and PPA) had different trends of decreased neural activity as the eccentricities of the images of the faces and houses increased. This study demonstrated that FFA and PPA had differences ratio relative to V1 (RRV1) for their neural response amplitudes in 3 dimensions. The differential RRV1s could be viewed as a processing strategy for encoding the images of the faces and houses with variations in eccentricity and meridian.</p><fig id="pone-0072728-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0072728.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Stimulus configuration and example of stimulus images.</title><p>(A) The images were either centered at the fixation point (0&#x000b0;) or centered at 16&#x000b0;, 32&#x000b0; or 48&#x000b0; for the left horizontal, right horizontal, upper vertical, or lower vertical meridians.

The subjects viewed the stimuli on a hemisphere 52 mm in diameter; the curvature radius of this hemisphere was 30 mm. The mean distance between the subjects' eyes and the screen was 30 mm.

The face images were taken from the FEI face database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fei.edu.br/~cet/facedatabase.html">http://fei.edu.br/~cet/facedatabase.html</ext-link>), and the houses images were photos taken in Okayama City. The objects were presented at a variety of positions and grayscale backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072728-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The position experiments utilized 48 unique images from each category. The images subtended a 12&#x000b0; visual angle at each position. We chose to use a constant image size because the magnification factors in the face- and house-selected areas were unknown, and the magnifications at the center and periphery were quite different. We wished to compare the neural activation corresponding to the images of the faces and houses at different positions throughout the central and peripheral visual fields. The images were centered at the fixation point (0&#x000b0; eccentricity) and were centered at 16&#x000b0;, 32&#x000b0; and 48&#x000b0; of eccentricities along 4 meridians: the left horizontal meridian, right horizontal meridian, upper vertical meridian and lower vertical meridian. A total of 13 positions were arranged in the 4 levels of eccentricities (0&#x000b0;, 16&#x000b0;, 32&#x000b0; and 48&#x000b0;) for each meridian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072728-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>The position experiments included 6 runs of block design experiment. Each run contained one 8-s block for each position and category combination; thus, the session contained 26 blocks per run (2 categories &#x000d7; 13 positions). The image blocks were interleaved with 8-s baseline blocks (a grayscale screen with a central fixation point). In each image block, a series of images from one category (face or house) were shown at a specific position in random order. The images were shown at a rate of 1 Hz (800 ms per image, with a 200 ms inter-stimulus interval). During the scanning process, the subjects were instructed to categorize each image while fixating on a red point (a red disk 1.8&#x000b0; in diameter that was present for the duration of the experiment). When the red disk dimmed, the subjects reported their categorization with two buttons that corresponded to either a face or a house. The dimming prompts lasted 1.2 s, with a 1.8- or 3.8-s interval between the prompts, and it was not synchronized with the stimulus onsets. The button presses that occurred outside of the 1.2-s period following a prompt were ignored. The fixation task was primarily used to ensure that the subjects maintained their fixation during the scans. Before scanning, the subjects practiced this task to minimize false alarms and to maintain their focus on the fixation point. Behavioral responses were collected during the scanning using a magnet-compatible button box connected to the stimulus computer.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Retinotopic Mapping Experiments</title><p>To identify the retinotopic areas of the visual cortex, the clockwise rotating wedge and expanding ring stimuli were employed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Wu1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Engel1">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-DeYoe1">[32]</xref>. These stimulus apertures contained 100% contrast black-and-white checkerboard patterns, and they phase-reversed at a temporal frequency of 8 Hz at an eccentricity ranging from 2.4&#x000b0; to 60&#x000b0;. The wedge stimulus with boundaries of 22.5&#x000b0; was slowly rotated clockwise around a red fixation disk (approximately 1&#x000b0;) presented at the center of the stimulus. The wedge rotated at 22.5&#x000b0; steps, remaining at each position for 6 s before moving to the next position. The eccentricity of the expanding rings ranged from 2.4&#x000b0; to 60&#x000b0;, and the width of the ring stimuli was expanded in exponential increments. The corresponding ring sizes were 1.2&#x000b0;, 1.8&#x000b0;, 2.7&#x000b0;, 4.0&#x000b0;, 6.0&#x000b0;, 9.0&#x000b0;, 13.4&#x000b0; and 20.0&#x000b0;. These expanding ring stimuli were moved in 8 discrete steps and remained at each position for 6 s before automatically expanding to the next position. All of the experiments involved passive viewing, and the subjects were required to maintain their gaze on the red fixation disk in the center of the screen that flickered at a temporal frequency of 4 Hz throughout the scan. Six complete cycles of rotations and checkerboard expansions were conducted.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Image Acquisition</title><p>The imaging was performed using a 3-Tesla MR scanner (Siemens Allegra, Erlangen, Germany).

Consistent with the behavior performance, the mean response magnitudes in V1, FFA and PPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072728-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072728-g005">5</xref>) decreased as the visual stimuli (images of houses and faces) were presented at progressively greater distances from the center of the visual field. The neural response to the checkerboard rings also exhibited a decreasing trend as the eccentricities increased; the central 3 rings covered the visual field of 8&#x000b0; eccentricities, and the peripheral 5 rings covered the visual field of 8&#x000b0;&#x02013;60&#x000b0; eccentricities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072728-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). These results confirmed the central-peripheral organization in the primate visual cortex. After normalizing the neural response magnitudes by dividing the response magnitudes at the central position, the RRCP values decreased with the same trend in V1 and with different trends in ventral category-selective areas (FFA and PPA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072728-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>An important new finding was revealed by comparing the RRV1s. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072728-g006">Figure 6</xref>, we found that the RRV1s in FFA and PPA had a significant effect of eccentricity (p &#x02264; 0.03) at the contralateral horizontal positions and upper vertical positions. Furthermore, the differences in eccentricity were mainly found at the contralateral horizontal and upper vertical positions for FFA and at the upper vertical positions for PPA. Measuring the signal intensity in V1 showed that the signal quality in the calcarine sulcus was very good. The signal intensities had no difference between the anterior and posterior regions of the calcarine sulcus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072728-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The consistent signal qualities confirmed that the differences in RRV1s were indeed the neural processing difference of the visual cortex but were not induced by dropping the signal quality. These results demonstrated that FFA and PPA had systematic neural variances from the central field to the peripheral field because the RRV1s increased with eccentricity, especially FFA. In the visual cortical areas, V1 is essential for visual information processing. A number of strategies, including linear and nonlinear filtering, are used for efficient information processing in the higher level areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-VanEssen1">[2]</xref>.

They analyzed neural responses along 4 meridians, including the ipsilateral horizontal positions. Their results suggest that the RRV1s of FFA in central visual field are a constant, which was approximately 1.3. In our study, within a wide visual field, the ipsilateral neural responses were weak or negative in V1 and PPA due to the contralateral main neural activities in the human visual cortex in response to stimuli, especially with regard to V1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Yue1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Hemond1">[46]</xref>. The RRV1s were not well suited to the ipsilateral neural responses, thus the ipsilateral neural responses were ignored. Combining all 3 meridians, our RRV1 results from FFA were compared with the results of Yue et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072728-g009">Figure 9</xref>). At the 0&#x000b0; and 16&#x000b0; positions, the RRV1s of FFA were consistent with Yue's results (t-test, p&#x02265;0.16), while in the peripheral positions (32&#x000b0; and 48&#x000b0;), our values were greater than those of Yue (t-test, p&#x02264;0.03). Additionally, in our study, the RRV1s at the 32&#x000b0; and 48&#x000b0; positions were significantly greater than those at the central position (p &#x02264; 0.04), and the RRV1 at the 48&#x000b0; position was significantly greater than those at the 16 &#x000b0; position. The stimuli in Yue's study covered the central visual fields, with approximately 12&#x000b0; of eccentricity. Obviously, the results from the central visual field did not represent the entire visual field. In combination with the report of Yue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0072728-Yue1">[26]</xref>, it was confirmed that the neural activation in FFA adopted different processing strategies in the dimension of eccentricity, compared to the neural activation function of V1, which showed smaller RRV1s at the central positions and larger RRV1s at the peripheral positions.

Face images had significant smaller magnitude responses than house images in V1, and neural responses to face images in FFA were significantly greater than the neural responses to house images in PPA. We found smaller neural activities to checkerboards in FFA than that in PPA. It was implied that FFA and PPA had different strategies for processing images of faces and houses. Furthermore, the RRCPs had only significant difference in ventral category-selective areas (FFA and PPA), but not in V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072728-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The RRV1s result also confirmed a difference between FFA and PPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072728-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In FFA, face images generated much greater RRV1s than house images in PPA (p &#x02264; 0.05), especially in the contralateral horizontal meridian positions. These results demonstrate that different processing strategies were also employed in FFA and PPA. From the present results, greater RRV1s indicate that the neural responses had greater ratios added to V1 functions. In FFA, the RRV1 values at all positions were greater than 1 (t test, p&#x0003c;0.0001), which means that FFA had an amplifying effect.

In another word, there was no amplifying effect in PPA to processing house images. These results demonstrated that the larger RRV1s were associated with the central representation in FFA, and the smaller RRV1s were associated with the peripheral representation in PPA.

Measuring the RRV1s, we found that the FFA and PPA process the visual information from V1 using different neural processing strategies. The first was the dimension of eccentricity, which the values of RRV1s at the central positions were smaller than those at the peripheral positions in FFA at the contralateral horizontal positions and upper vertical positions, and in PPA only at the upper vertical positions. The second was the dimension of meridian, which the RRV1s observed at the upper vertical positions were greater than those at the lower vertical positions. The third was the dimension of region, which the RRV1s in FFA were greater than those in the PPA, and the significantly increasing trends of RRV1s were observed in FFA. The findings reported here suggested that the ventral category-selective areas develop specific modes to process stimuli located at different positions, depending on the retinal locations of where the object is typically observed in daily life. Taken together, these different neural processing strategies of the ventral visual cortex might be shaped by experience.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting
