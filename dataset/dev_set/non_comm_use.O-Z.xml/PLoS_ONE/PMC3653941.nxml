It exists as both membrane-bound and soluble forms. LAIR-1 functions as an inhibitory receptor on natural killer cells, T lymphocytes and monocytes. In addition to LAIR-1, the human genome encodes LAIR-2, a soluble homolog. Several studies have focused on LAIR-1, whereas few investigations concentrate on the expression and function of LAIR-2. We demonstrate the presence of high LAIR-2 levels in 74/80 sera from patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases (both Graves&#x02019; disease and autoimmune thyroiditis). LAIR-2 levels seemed not to be related to specific clinical manifestations, such as thyroid functions (hypo- or hyperthyroidism), or specific clinical features (such as ophtalmopathy). In addition, serum LAIR-2 is able, <italic>in vitro,</italic> to bind its natural ligand, collagen. Since LAIR-2 has been found to have higher affinity for collagens than LAIR-1 did, we hypothesize a potential regulating capability of serum LAIR-2 in finally regulating the inhibitory capability of LAIR-1.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from Fondazione CARIGE.

Therefore, a prevalence of activation should render T cells responsive to antigens, whereas a prevalence of inhibition should lead to T-cell anergy. T-cell activation requires a primary signal delivered by the antigenic peptide presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and a non-specific signal that can finely regulate the level of activation or inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lenschow1">[1]</xref>. Inhibitory signals are required to terminate an immune response and to prevent excessive immune reactions or autoimmune disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lenschow1">[1]</xref>. These signals can be provided by inhibitory immunoreceptors, often containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in their cytoplasmic tails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lenschow1">[1]</xref>. Immune cells express several inhibitory receptors, differentially expressed on immune cells: their expression is known to change upon cellular activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Greenwald1">[2]</xref>. Another regulation pathway is provided by secretion of soluble receptor variants retaining their ligand binding capacity. Soluble receptors can be obtained either by proteolytic cleavage/shedding or alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Levine1">[3]</xref>. For example, soluble CTLA-4 shows immunoregulatory functions via binding to CD80/CD86 molecules and acts indirectly either as inhibitor or as enhancer of immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Saverino1">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor is a small family of ITIM-containing inhibitory receptor, belonging to the Ig superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Meyaard1">[5]</xref>. LAIR-2, is a secreted molecule, whereas LAIR-1 is its membrane bound homologue, LAIR-2 is believed to play a regulatory role in the interaction between collagen and LAIR-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-OldeNordkamp1">[7]</xref>. LAIR-2 is encoded by a gene located near the LAIR-1 gene in the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) on human chromosome 19q13.4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Meyaard1">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink2">[9]</xref>, suggesting that these molecules have evolved from a common ancestral gene. LAIR-2 protein has a single Ig-like domain sharing 84% sequence homology with LAIR-1, and lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions suggesting that it is a secreted protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Meyaard1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-OldeNordkamp1">[7]</xref>. LAIR-1 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein of 287 amino acids containing a single extracellular C2-type Ig-like domain and two ITIMs in its cytoplasmic tail. LAIR-1 is expressed on the majority of immunocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Meyaard1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Meyaard2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Merlo1">[10]</xref>. Cross-linking of LAIR-1 in vitro delivers a potent inhibitory signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Meyaard1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Meyaard2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Merlo1">[10]</xref>. Recently, collagens were identified as natural, high-affinity ligands for LAIR molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink2">[9]</xref>. Interaction of LAIR-1 with collagens directly inhibits immunocyte activation in vitro and may represent a key mechanism of peripheral immune regulation through extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink2">[9]</xref>. Given the broad expression profile of LAIR-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Meyaard1">[5]</xref> and the abundance of collagen in the human body, a fine-tuned regulation of collagen-LAIR-1 interaction is likely needed. As above mentioned, the soluble LAIR-2 molecule present in the plasma and interstitial fluid is likely to play a significant role in such regulation.</p><p>Importantly, a role for LAIR-2 in systemic autoimmunity is suggested by the observation of increased LAIR-2 levels in synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink3">[11]</xref> and ankylosing spondylitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-DazPea1">[12]</xref>. However, data concerning the possible role of LAIR-2 and LAIR molecules/collagen interactions in organ-specific autoimmunity are lacking. Autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD), namely, autoimmune (Hashimoto&#x02019;s) thyroiditis and Graves&#x02019; disease, are the most frequent organ-specific autoimmune diseases, and autoimmune thyroiditis is regarded as a prototype of such pathological conditions. Here we report the presence of high levels of LAIR-2 in sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>2.1 Serum Samples</title><p>Serum samples were obtained from 80 patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD) (28 males, 52 females, age range 22&#x02013;60). Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients; all samples were obtained following the ethical guidelines of the most recent Declaration of Helsinki (Edinburg 2000) and approved by the Ethics Committee of Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy. Twenty-one of them had Hashimoto&#x02019;s thyroiditis (HT), 59 Graves&#x02019; disease (GD). The very large majority of ATD patients had detectable levels of auto-antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (77 out of 80), 51 out of 80 had also auto-antibodies to thyroglobulin. The diagnosis was formulated on the basis of commonly accepted clinical and laboratory criteria, including thyroid ultrasonography, serum TSH and free thyroid hormone levels, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and anti-TSH receptor antibodies and thyroid scintigraphy (for GD). Patients with HT were either mild hypothyroid (raise TSH with low-normal free thyroxine) or euthyroid under L-thyroxine replacement. Patients with GD were hyperthyroid (from mild to severe) and were studied before starting antithyroid therapy: 41 of them had clinically apparent Graves&#x02019; ophthalmopathy. Finally, from a group of 20 GD patients serum samples were collected also 1 month after radioiodine therapy. In these patients euthyroidism or post-treatment hypothyroidism was documented, as well as thyroid gland volume reduction (by ultrasonography).</p><p>As control, we collected sera from 10 patients with non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism (toxic adenoma or multinodular toxic goiter, MNTG, which are closely related non-autoimmune thyroid diseases with hyperthyroidism caused by autonomously functioning thyroid nodules) and from 25 healthy donors.</p><p>Free thyroid hormone concentrations were assayed by routine ELISA methods, as well as TSH (3<sup>rd</sup> generation) and Thyroid Peroxidase and Thyroglobulin autoantibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>2.2 ELISA</title><p>Serum LAIR-2 was measured by ELISA.

After washings, plates were incubated with PBS-3% BSA to block aspecific interactions. After three washes, sera were assayed for presence of the LAIR-2 protein. Human recombinant LAIR-2-Fc construct (Lair-2 fused to the Fc region of human IgG, GeneBank ID: NP002279, R&#x00026;D Systems) serially diluted from 200 ng/ml was used as reference.

Twenty-three out of 25 sera from healthy controls (92%) had detectable LAIR-2 (0.1&#x02013;6.2 ng/ml). This is at variance with previous observation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink1">[6]</xref> possibly due to different mAb used. In addition, 74 out 80 ATD patients had far higher circulating LAIR-2 levels (4.6&#x02013;450 ng/ml) (p&#x0003c;0.05). By contrast, a similar percentage of positive sera were observed (94%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063282-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). There was no difference between patients with HT and GD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063282-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). In addition, LAIR-2 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with hyperthyroid GD than in controls with non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism (p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063282-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, MNTG). There was no relationship between sex and age and LAIR-2. In fact, LAIR-2 mean level was similar in males (200.2 ng/ml&#x000b1;121.7) and females (206.9 ng/ml&#x000b1;141.0) (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.873) and was not associated with age (Pearson correlation coefficient&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.03; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.85). We found no relationship in GD between LAIR-2 and hyperthyroidism severity, or presence/severity of ophthalmopathy, or thyroid auto-antibodies (as also in HT, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0063282-t001">Table 1</xref>). Of interest, the analysis of sera collected from patients at different time points (before and 1 months after radio-iodine therapy) showed that the ability to produce LAIR-2 is not related to thyroid functions. As shown if <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063282-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, no statistical differences in serum LAIR-2 levels among GD patients before and after radio-iodine therapy were evident. In addition, post hoc analysis confirm these results showing significantly increased LAIR-2 mean levels in GD and HT and in GD patients after radio iodine therapy than in healthy donors, in GD and HT than in MNTG patients, and in GD patients after radio iodine therapy than in MNTG patients.

The inhibitory immune receptor family LAIR is expressed on most cells of the immune system, and its ligand collagen is ubiquitously expressed in the tissues. Therefore, triggering of the inhibitory immune receptor LAIR must be carefully regulated.</p><p>The identification of collagens as ligands for LAIR-1 revealed a novel function for extracellular matrix components as potential immune regulatory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-OldeNordkamp1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink2">[9]</xref>. Subsequently, it was observed that this interaction could be blocked by LAIR-2, a secreted member of the LAIR-1 family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink1">[6]</xref>. An interesting implication of the discovery of LAIR-1 as an inhibitory collagen receptor is that tumor cells, known to upregulate collagen expression, may use this interaction to downregulate anti-tumor responses. Both extracellular matrix collagens and transmembrane collagens have been reported to be produced by tumor cells and/or tumor stroma. In addition, LAIR-2 molecules bind the same collagen molecules as the transmembrane inhibitory receptor LAIR-1 and this soluble receptor can block the interaction of LAIR-1 to both transmembrane and extracellular collagens. Hence, LAIR-2 may function as a competitor for human LAIR-1 in vivo, thereby regulating the inhibitory potential of this receptor.</p><p>Interestingly, LAIR-2 levels were demonstrated to be elevated in the joints of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when compared to patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink3">[11]</xref>. RA is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by a persistent inflammation of the joints, which results in chronic tissue destruction. On the contrast, osteoarthritis is a result of both mechanical and biologic events that destabilize the normal coupling of degradation and synthesis of articular cartilage and are frequently characterized by a moderate inflammation. Thus, LAIR-2 may function as a pro-inflammatory mediator by decreasing the inhibitory potential of the immune inhibitor LAIR-1, resulting in enhanced activation of immune cells, a characteristic of autoimmune diseases.</p><p>ATD are prototypic organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune thyroiditis is, characterized by marked mononucleate cell infiltration of the thyroid gland, with thyroid cell destruction and thyroid structure remodelling, eventually resulting in hypothyroidism. Graves&#x02019; disease causes hyperthyroidism mediated by thyroid-stimulating TSH-receptor antibodies, moreover extrathyroid tissue involvement (notably orbital structures in Graves&#x02019; ophthalmopathy) is often present. The collagen-rich extracellular matrix is important for maintenance of tissue structure, cell adhesion and migration during growth, differentiation, morphogenesis and lesion healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Myllyharju1">[15]</xref>. Collagen is a fibroblast cell membrane protein and serum antibodies against collagen (at least against the collagen XIII) have been linked to recent onset, congestive ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves&#x02019; ophthalmopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-DeBellis1">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Given the broad LAIR-1 expression on immunocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Meyaard1">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Merlo1">[10]</xref> and the abundance of its ligand, collagen, and the capability of LAIR-2 to compete to LAIR-1, the interaction of LAIR-2 with collagen is probably relevant for immunoregulation in both normal and pathological conditions. We show that LAIR-2 serum levels are at least 100 fold higher in ATD subjects than in controls. Increased LAIR-2 levels in ATD could be associated with and contribute to chronic inflammation characterizing organ-specific autoimmunity. That this effect is due to altered thyroid function <italic>per se</italic> is unlikely, given that non-autoimmune hyperthyroid subjects (MNTG) studied for control showed LAIR-2 levels comparable to healthy individuals. LAIR-2 may function by down-modulating the inhibitory potential of LAIR-1. This event may prevent the binding of collagen to LAIR-1 thus resulting in immune activation. In support of this hypohesis, endogenous LAIR-2 has been shown to bind the extracellular matrix of chorionic villi <italic>ex vivo</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Founds1">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Of note, both soluble LAIR-1 (sLAIR-1) and LAIR-2 have been detected in the synovial fluid and urine of RA patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink3">[11]</xref>. In addition, detectable levels of sLAIR-1 in the serum of healthy control subjects and increased levels in the sera of patients with hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Welch1">[14]</xref>. This suggests a possible role of both of sLAIR-1 shedding and increased LAIR-2 production in the regulation of LAIR-1&#x02013;induced inhibition, at least in these cases. Data on sLAIR-1 concentrations in sera from AITD patients are at present not available to us. However, monomer LAIR-2 was found to bind collagen with a higher affinity than does the membrane form of LAIR-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lebbink3">[11]</xref>, and to have a higher affinity for collagens than does sLAIR-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0063282-Lenting1">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Thus, LAIR-2 is likely to play a pivotal regulatory role of LAIR-1 function on T cells This might be a quite general mechanism, and the role of LAIR-2 in diseases with chronic inflammation, including allergic diseases, is worth of
