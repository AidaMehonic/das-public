Until now, the quantity and quality of harvestable biomass from conservation grasslands in Minnesota, USA, was not known, and the factors that affect bioenergy potential from these systems have not been identified. We measured biomass yield, theoretical ethanol conversion efficiency, and plant tissue nitrogen (N) as metrics of bioenergy potential from mixed-species conservation grasslands harvested with commercial-scale equipment. With three years of data, we used mixed-effects models to determine factors that influence bioenergy potential. Sixty conservation grassland plots, each about 8 ha in size, were distributed among three locations in Minnesota. Harvest treatments were applied annually in autumn as a completely randomized block design. Biomass yield ranged from 0.5 to 5.7 Mg ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. May precipitation increased biomass yield while precipitation in all other growing season months showed no affect. Averaged across all locations and years, theoretical ethanol conversion efficiency was 450 l Mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and the concentration of plant N was 7.1 g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, both similar to dedicated herbaceous bioenergy crops such as switchgrass. Biomass yield did not decline in the second or third year of harvest. Across years, biomass yields fluctuated 23% around the average. Surprisingly, forb cover was a better predictor of biomass yield than warm-season grass with a positive correlation with biomass yield in the south and a negative correlation at other locations. Variation in land ethanol yield was almost exclusively due to variation in biomass yield rather than biomass quality; therefore, efforts to increase biomass yield might be more economical than altering biomass composition when managing conservation grasslands for ethanol production. Our measurements of bioenergy potential, and the factors that control it, can serve as parameters for assessing the economic viability of harvesting conservation grasslands for bioenergy.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund as recommended by the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources.

In many regions of North America, diverse grasslands have not produced as much gross biomass as dedicated energy crops grown in monoculture such as switchgrass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Johnson1">[7]</xref>. This has initiated questions regarding the economic viability of diverse grassland bioenergy, yet few studies have quantified bioenergy yields from diverse perennial plantings over multiple years. Only recently have studies compared the bioenergy potential of mixed-species grasslands harvested with production-scale techniques in various regions of the Upper Midwest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Lee1">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Growing biomass on land unsuitable for commodity crops transforms the economic outlook for bioenergy systems. Bioenergy production from feedstocks grown on marginal or underutilized land, such as land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), can provide immediate greenhouse gas benefits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Gelfand1">[9]</xref> while avoiding competition for land between food and energy crops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Hill1">[10]</xref>. One idea is to harvest biomass from CRP land as revenue to supplement government subsidies, potentially incentivizing renewal of CRP contracts and offsetting recent trends in expiring CRP acreage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Olson1">[11]</xref>. Current CRP regulations do not allow biomass harvest from land enrolled in the program. If economic opportunities from bioenergy initiate new regulations that allow biomass harvest, these regulations should be designed to support the original intentions of the CRP, including improved wildlife abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Wiens1">[12]</xref>, an important component of biodiversity.</p><p>Other conservation lands managed for wildlife by state, federal, and non-profit agencies have been planted with mixtures of perennial grassland species. These may serve as biomass sources for energy production. Studies are underway to determine the effects of biomass harvest on resident wildlife in various types of conservation grasslands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Jungers1">[13]</xref>. If research concludes that conservation grasslands can be managed for bioenergy and biodiversity simultaneously, then the quality and quantity of harvested biomass from conservation lands should be considered before bioenergy management is implemented.</p><p>The amount of bioenergy from conservation grasslands depends on both biomass quantity and quality. One means of measuring biomass quantity is to multiply yields from CRP fields in different regions of North America by estimates of available acreage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Lee1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Cai1">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Venuto1">[16]</xref>. These yields can then be extrapolated to estimate biomass from land not currently enrolled in, but eligible for conservation programs. Another important component of predicting bioenergy potential is biomass quality, often defined by the mineral and sugar concentrations of the biomass. Mineral concentrations are used to predict conversion efficiency for thermochemical energy production. High concentrations of alkali metals in post-combustion ash lead to slagging and fouling in thermochemical systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Baxter1">[17]</xref>, while high concentrations of N, S, and other elements pose issues of oxide emissions and possibly nutrient removal from soils in long-term harvested systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Robertson2">[18]</xref>. Predicting the efficiency of biofuel production with biochemical technologies requires measuring the plant sugar and carbohydrate concentrations. High values of cellulose and hemicellulose relative to lignin results in greater liquid biofuel potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-David1">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Variation in the quantity and quality of grassland biomass with respect to energy production&#x02013;hereafter called bioenergy potential&#x02013;can occur due to variation in plant species composition, geographic location, and management activities. Plant composition influences bioenergy potential with studies indicating positive relationships between (i) biomass yield and planted species richness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Tilman1">[2]</xref> and (ii) relative cover of warm-season grasses (C4) and lignocellulose ratios that favor ethanol production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Cai1">[14]</xref>. In southern Iowa, spatial variation in biomass yield and elemental composition was greater within fields than between fields and was correlated to individual species within cool-season (C3) grasslands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Florine1">[20]</xref>. A broad-scale analysis of switchgrass yields across the Great Plains indicated that within-field variation is small enough to consider the mean biomass yield of a field for modeling purposes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Schmer1">[21]</xref>. Di Virgilio <italic>et al</italic>. found correlations between switchgrass yields and both soil fertility and moisture, which were interpreted as sources of within-field variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Divirgilio1">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Management activities, including harvest, also affect bioenergy potential. Harvesting biomass after senescence allows for plants to translocate nutrients to belowground tissues, but harvesting post-senescence means that vegetation is removed after peak biomass and lodging have occurred. In Oklahoma and South Dakota, delaying harvest until October increased yields and decreased N and ash concentrations in CRP biomass compared to pre-peak biomass harvests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Venuto1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Mulkey1">[23]</xref>. Harvesting switchgrass-dominated CRP lands every year compared with alternate years increased yields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Lee2">[24]</xref>, while deferring harvest to more than two year intervals lowered bioenergy potential in Canadian conservation grasslands managed for wildlife <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Jefferson1">[25]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we modeled bioenergy potential of conservation grasslands based on three response variables related to quantity and quality: biomass yield, theoretical ethanol conversion efficiency, and plant tissue N. We used data collected from large-scale plots distributed across three locations of western Minnesota and harvested with commercial-scale tools and techniques. Our objectives were (i) to determine biomass yields, theoretical ethanol conversion efficiency, and plant tissue N content from conservation grasslands, (ii) to measure the variability of bioenergy potential along a latitudinal gradient in western Minnesota, and (iii) to understand what factors affect bioenergy potential by modeling the three response variables with data on plant communities, soil fertility, precipitation, and management activities while accounting for space and time. Two harvest treatments were used to determine if yields from completely harvested plots followed similar trends through time as yields from plots that included previously unharvested regions of biomass. Our results are intended to aid policy and land-management decisions regarding the use of conservation grasslands for bioenergy production in the Upper Midwest, USA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental design</title><p>In 2008, we located and delineated 60 plots within existing grasslands enrolled in a conservation program. Plots were distributed among three locations (hereafter north, central, and south locations) spanning a latitudinal gradient in western Minnesota, USA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061209-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Soils of the south are glacial till, the north are laucustrine, and the central has regions containing both. Forty plots were located on conservation grasslands managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), eight plots managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and 12 plots managed by private landowners as part of the CRP. Each plot was about 8 ha (20 acres; mean&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8.1 ha, SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.5 ha) in size and contained a mixture of grasses and forbs. All plots were established more than five years prior to the project start date. Three of 12 CRP plots were planted with perennial introduced grasses and legumes (CP1) and the rest with perennial native grasses (CP2). The DNR plots were established with different species, but all were categorized as &#x0201c;restored/planted tall grass prairie&#x0201d;. A list of the most frequently observed species is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061209.s001">Table S1</xref>.

Each block contained a control (no harvest) and three harvested plots. Since the control plots were not harvested, this analysis does not include data from those plots. Plots were randomly assigned a harvest treatment, and, for this analysis, were considered either a high- or low-intensity harvest. High-intensity treatments involved a complete harvest of the assigned plot while low-intensity treatments involved a partial harvest so that the plot contained a refuge of standing vegetation of 2 or 4 ha. The harvest treatments were designed to maintain other uses of the grassland, such as habitat for wildlife. In low-intensity harvest treatments, the refuge moved annually within the fixed plot area so that each year, a portion of the harvested area contained biomass that was not harvested the previous year. At all three locations, each block included one control plot, one high-intensity treatment, and two low-intensity treatments with refuges of 2 ha. A separate sub-study allowed the establishment of extra plots in the south location. Blocks in the south location included one extra high-intensity treatment plot and two extra low-intensity treatment plots (totaling seven plots per block). The extra low-intensity treatment plots had refuges of 4 ha. Twenty four plots were scheduled to be harvested in the south and twelve in each the central and north locations. Weather prevented the harvest of certain plots each year. No plots were harvested in the north in 2011 due to expiring land contracts.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Field and laboratory methods</title><p>A single operator harvested the plots between late October and mid December in 2009, 2010, and 2011. No plots were harvested after the first significant snowfall. Vegetation was harvested to a target height of 15 cm with a self-propelled windrower with a mounted disc cutter. When conditions were deemed dry enough by the operator, the cut biomass was immediately baled using a large round baler. If the cut biomass required drying, it was raked into larger windrows and left to dry before being baled. Due to time constraints and landowner regulations, bales were removed from the plots as soon as possible, therefore individual bales were not weighed from each plot. Instead, bales were loaded onto semi trailers and weighed with a scale certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation on transport for storage. This weight was divided by the number of bales on the trailer to determine an average bale weight and variation (coefficient of variation&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9%; for further details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061209.s004">Text S1</xref>). We divided the sum of all the trailer weights by the total number of bales to generate an overall average bale weight. The average bale weight was multiplied by the number of bales from each plot to estimate total harvested biomass. The perimeter of the cut area in each plot was measured using a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) (Garmin Ltd., Olathe, Kansas, USA) on an all-terrain vehicle. Biomass yield was determined for each plot as the amount of biomass harvested (Mg) divided by the area cut (ha).</p><p>While bales were still in the field, core samples were extracted from bales of harvested biomass for each plot with a hay probe (Forageurs Corp., Lakeville, MN, USA) attached to an electric drill. One biomass core was collected from every other bale as they were ejected from the baler; therefore the number of core samples was determined by the size of the harvested area within the plot and biomass productivity (mean number of cores in high-intensity plots&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22). Cores were aggregated by plot and weighed wet immediately after collection (mean sample weight&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;156 g), dried at 45&#x000b0; C for four days, reweighed and used here to estimate bale yields on a dry matter basis.</p><p>Chemical constituents of the biomass were measured from the aggregated core samples for each plot. Biomass samples were dried at 45&#x000b0; C for four days, ground with a Wiley mill (Thomas-Wiley Mill Co., Philadelphia, PA, USA) to pass a 1 mm screen, and then reground with a cyclone mill. A subsample from each plot was analyzed for N by AgVise Laboratories using methods described on their website (Agvise Inc., Benson MN; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.agvise.com">http://www.agvise.com</ext-link>).</p><p>The concentration of cell wall carbohydrates was determined using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with methods described by Schmer <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Schmer2">[26]</xref>.

A total of 24 quadrats were sampled in the high-intensity treatment plots in 2010 to assess sample power. In 2009, plant community data was collected from quadrats, each 0.75&#x000d7;5 m, in all plots. Quadrat locations were generated with ArcGIS 9.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) and loaded to hand-held GPS units. Within each quadrat, surveyors identified all plant species and assigned each a score for relative abundance as a percentage of the canopy cover in the quadrat. Bare ground and litter were also assigned a percentage. Species were aggregated into functional groups for analysis. The average cover value for each functional group was calculated by plot.</p><p>Cooperative Farming Agreements, Special Use Permits, and a letter of approval were acquired from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the US Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency for permission to conduct research on state, federal and private land.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Three response variables related to different components of bioenergy potential were measured in all plots and modeled in this study: biomass yield, theoretical ethanol conversion efficiency, and plant tissue N. Linear mixed effects models were used to test the main effect of location on the three response variables and to determine which covariates were significantly correlated with them. Total variation for each response variable was partitioned into four levels of a temporal/spatial hierarchy that was used as the random structure for the variance components analysis. The largest level of this hierarchy partitioned variance among years, with lower levels partitioning variance between locations, between blocks, and within plots; each level nested within the higher level.

In this study, it was the cover of non-legume forbs that explained variation in biomass yield (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061209-t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061209-t005">5</xref>). In the south location, plots with greater average forb cover had higher biomass yields, while in the central and north locations, increasing forb cover was associated with lower yields. We expected, as Adler <italic>et al</italic>. documented, that the cover of C4 grass would be positively correlated with biomass yield, and our competitive models include that variable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061209-t004">Table 4</xref>). It is possible that an increase in forb cover displaces C4 grasses, which would explain the negative correlation between forb cover and biomass yield in the central and north locations. The inverse relationship between forb cover and biomass yield in the south could be driven by a high-yielding forb species that is present or abundant in the south but not in the other locations. We explored this possibility and found that common milkweed (<italic>Asclepias syriaca</italic>) was present in 300 sample points in the south and only 50 and 5 sample points in the central and north locations. Using data from all sample points, a Pearson's correlation test showed that the cover of common milkweed was not correlated to the cover of C4 grass (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.303) but was correlated to biomass yield (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.016). This suggests that common milkweed could increase biomass yield without displacing C4 grass cover (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061209-t006">Table 6</xref>).

Studies of switchgrass show that harvesting later after plant senescence results in higher potential ethanol conversion efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061209-Adler2">[43]</xref>, thus a similar pattern could exist in polyculture grasslands. We harvested plots in sequence from the north to the south so that the plants would be at a similar phenological stage at the time of cutting. A negative correlation between plant tissue N and ethanol conversion efficiency was apparent in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0061209-t005">Table 5</xref>), and since plant N decreases with senescence, the later harvest date in the south location may have contributed to higher ethanol conversion efficiency found here.

When considering N fertilizers, land managers must weigh the potential benefits for biomass yields against potential detrimental effects including undesirable shifts in species composition and decreased biomass quality.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Biomass quality from mixed-species grasslands not managed for bioenergy is similar to dedicated energy feedstocks, in terms of theoretical ethanol conversion efficiency and biomass N. Almost all of the variation in land ethanol yield is based on biomass yield, therefore efforts should be focused on maximizing biomass yield rather than biomass quality when managing grasslands for land ethanol yield. A combination of climate, soil fertility, and plant community factors influence overall bioenergy potential. The effect of forbs and legumes on biomass yield and tissue N, respectively, were different in the south compared with the central and north locations. The covariates we measured did not explain why theoretical ethanol conversion efficiency was greater in the south compared with the other locations, but the cover of C4 grass was positively correlated with ethanol conversion efficiency. After three continuous years of harvest, leaving a portion of standing biomass within the harvested area does not influence biomass yield of future harvests. Simply focusing on plant community variables to predict bioenergy potential of conservation grasslands across various locations at the scale we studied will not provide accurate estimates; instead attention should be drawn to local variation in soil fertility, climate, and possibly plant species and interactions between these variables.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0061209.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Ten most frequently observed species and their average percent cover in sample quadrats.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0061209.s001.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0061209.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Calibration statistics for NIRS prediction of forage characteristics and plant cell polysaccharides.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0061209.s002.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0061209.s003"><label>Equation S1</label><caption><p><bold>Equation to estimate theoretical ethanol conversion efficiency from sugar concentrations.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0061209.s003.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0061209.s004"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p><bold>Assessment of bale weight variability for large round bales of biomass harvested from conservation grasslands.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0061209.s004.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0061209.s005"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p><bold>Calculations for estimating residential power production from conservation grasslands in SW Minnesota.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0061209.s005.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank K.
