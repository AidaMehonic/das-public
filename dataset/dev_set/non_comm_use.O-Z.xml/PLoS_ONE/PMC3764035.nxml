HDAC inhibitors have uncovered a role for HDACs in proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation. However, little is known of the roles of specific HDACs in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). We investigated the consequences of ablating both HDAC1 and HDAC2 in murine IECs. Floxed <italic>Hdac1</italic> and <italic>Hdac2</italic> homozygous mice were crossed with villin-Cre mice. Mice deficient in both IEC HDAC1 and HDAC2 weighed less and survived more than a year. Colon and small intestinal sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, or with Alcian blue and Periodic Acid Schiff for goblet cell identification. Tissue sections from mice injected with BrdU for 2 h, 14 h and 48 h were stained with anti-BrdU. To determine intestinal permeability, 4-kDa FITC-labeled dextran was given by gavage for 3 h. Microarray analysis was performed on total colon RNAs. Inflammatory and IEC-specific gene expression was assessed by Western blot or semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qPCR with respectively total colon protein and total colon RNAs. HDAC1 and HDAC2-deficient mice displayed: 1) increased migration and proliferation, with elevated cyclin D1 expression and phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein, a downstream mTOR target; 2) tissue architecture defects with cell differentiation alterations, correlating with reduction of secretory Paneth and goblet cells in jejunum and goblet cells in colon, increased expression of enterocytic markers such as sucrase-isomaltase in the colon, increased expression of cleaved Notch1 and augmented intestinal permeability; 3) loss of tissue homeostasis, as evidenced by modifications of claudin 3 expression, caspase-3 cleavage and Stat3 phosphorylation; 4) chronic inflammation, as determined by inflammatory molecular expression signatures and altered inflammatory gene expression. Thus, epithelial HDAC1 and HDAC2 restrain the intestinal inflammatory response, by regulating intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work has been supported by a grant from the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ccfc.ca">www.ccfc.ca</ext-link>).

Differentiation and maintenance of intestinal stem cells is regulated by different pathways, including the Notch pathway which controls secretory cell and enterocyte determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. While absorptive enterocytes, mucin-producing goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells reside in small intestinal villi, antimicrobial peptide-secreting Paneth cells remain in the crypts. The colonic epithelium contains colonocytes as well as goblet and enteroendocrine cells, without Paneth cells. All gut epithelium lineages contribute to mucosal barrier function. This barrier is both physical, with the presence of tight junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and chemical, through production of mucins and the mucus layer by goblet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and of antimicrobial proteins by Paneth cells as well as other IECs, including enterocytes and goblet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition to this barrier function, epithelial cells translate signals coming from intestinal luminal contents, including the microbiota, to different immune cells, in order to maintain intestinal homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For example, while the mucous layer limits bacterial colonization at IEC surfaces, Paneth cells, enterocytes and colonocytes relay microbiota-derived signals in order to induce antimicrobial peptide production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thus, IECs, bacteria and immune cells communicate to insure intestinal homeostasis. However, disruption of various mechanisms preserving this equilibrium may lead to inappropriate inflammatory responses observed in inflammatory bowel diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Whereas many pathways involved in the regulation of murine intestinal differentiation, proliferation and homeostasis have been discovered, the extent of epigenetic dependent transcriptional mechanisms such as acetylation and the role of various acetylation regulators, including histone deacetylases (HDAC), remain to be fully determined. Lysine-targeted acetylation and deacetylation of histones and non-histone proteins are regulated respectively by histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and HDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Histone acetylation decreases histone interactions with DNA, resulting in relaxed chromatin, and creates docking sites for bromodomain containing proteins, which ultimately affect chromatin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Protein acetylation levels are regulated by HDACs, which remove acetyl groups from histones to stimulate chromatin condensation, and from non-histone proteins, resulting in either gene repression or gene activation. Indeed, transcriptomic experiments suggest that HDACs display repressive as well as activating transcriptional activities, depending on the promoter and chromatin context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. HDACs are divided in four classes. Of these, ubiquitously expressed and highly homologous nuclear class I HDAC1 and HDAC2 form homo- or heterodimers, and are recruited to chromatin as part of large Sin3, CoREST and NuRD multiprotein complexes, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These complexes contain additional chromatin-modifying activities, such as the LSD1 H3K4 demethylase in CoREST complexes, and the MI-2 chromatin remodelling enzyme in NuRD complexes.</p><p>HDAC1 and HDAC2 display both overlapping and non-redundant functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Indeed, while HDAC1 deficiency leads to pre-natal death and proliferative defects in mice, HDAC2 knockout results in perinatal lethality and cardiac arrhythmias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. HDAC1, and to a lesser extent HDAC2, is a negative regulator of cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. HDAC inhibitors and down-regulation of specific HDACs, including HDAC1 and HDAC2, inhibit colon cancer cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and modulate both inflammation and immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Acetylated targets include, in addition to histones, transcription factors which may be acetylated by HATs and deacetylated by HDACs. For example, both HDAC3 and HDAC1 deacetylate the p65 NF-&#x003ba;B subunit, leading to decreased acetylation and transcriptional activity during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>To determine specific roles for HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the intestinal epithelium, we produced IEC-specific conditional mutant mice for both genes. We show that HDAC1/2 depletion in IEC alters intestinal organ growth, with defects in intestinal architecture and intestinal cell fate determination. We show that IEC-specific deletion of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 alters Notch and mTOR signalling pathways, among others, leading to chronic inflammation and disturbed homeostasis. Our findings suggest that epithelial HDAC1 and HDAC2 restrain the intestinal inflammatory response, and regulate intestinal epithelial cell polarity, proliferation and differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Mice</title><p>HDAC1 and HDAC2 conditionally mutated mice were provided by Dr EN Olson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

However, independent conditional tissue-specific deletions of HDAC1 or HDAC2 in various tissues, such as heart and brain among others, did not display apparent phenotypes in contrast to HDAC1/2 dual deletion, suggesting partly redundant functions during post-natal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In order to determine the roles of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 and to determine the complete phenotype, we created double HDAC1/2 IEC specific knockout mice by crossing HDAC1/2 floxed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] with villin-Cre transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

While HDAC1/2 IEC-specific null mice appeared normal and survived for more than a year, mutant mice displayed looser than normal stools. Both 4- to -5-month-old male and female HDAC1/2 IEC deficient mice weighed less than wild-type mice, with a 10 to 13% decrease in weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073785.s001">Figure S1</xref>). HDAC1/2 depletion was confirmed by Western blot analysis of Matrisperse-enriched IEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073785.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We performed immunofluorescence studies of colon and jejunum from four-month-old and one-year-old control and mutant mice. While HDAC1 expression was undetectable in the murine epithelium, HDAC2 expression was patchy. Indeed, while most epithelial crypt and villus cells were negative for HDAC2 staining, we still observed some crypts and villi expressing HDAC2. This patchy expression pattern was observed to the same extent in four-month-old and one-year-old mutant mice (data not shown). Macroscopic analysis showed that HDAC1/2 depletion resulted in an increase in intestine length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073785-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We thus measured small intestine or colon length and weight after four months and one year. Small intestine length and weight were significantly increased in mutant mice after four months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073785-g001">Figure 1B, 1D</xref>) and one year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073785-g001">Figure 1C, 1E</xref>) by respectively 12% and 57%.

The pattern of expression of some groups of inflammatory genes confirmed increased immune cell infiltration in HDAC1/2 IEC-deficient murine colon, such as myeloid cells. For example, microarray data show that receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins (FcR) were increased significantly 2.31-fold (Fcgr2b), 2.21-fold (Fcgr3) and 3.15-fold (Fcgr4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073785.s006">Table S2</xref>).

While conditional HDAC1 or HDAC2 deletion in many tissues does not affect tissue cell viability, tissue-specific depletion of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 in mice disrupts cell differentiation and growth. For example, in the heart, dual HDAC1 and HDAC2 invalidation leads to cardiac deficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. HDAC1 and HDAC2 specific ablation in the epidermis results in impaired epidermal regulator p63-dependent differentiation and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], while specific knockouts in early B cell progenitors arrest B cell development at the pre-B cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our data reveal an important role of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and growth in vivo.</p><p>Homozygous IEC-specific HDAC1/2 deleted mice weigh less and survive for more than a year. Our results show a disruption of intestinal architecture, with dysplastic and hyperplastic mucosa as well as expanded crypts and branched villi. Three major phenotypic effects are observed. First, HDAC1/2 loss leads to differentiation defects with decreases in secretory Paneth and goblet cells, and increases in the number of enterocytes expressing small intestinal markers, such as sucrase-isomaltase, in the colon. This loss of secretory cell types, accompanied by induction of enterocyte markers, suggests the activation of the Notch pathway, which, by controlling stem cell fate, regulates negatively secretory cell determination and positively enterocyte determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Indeed, we have observed an increase in activated cleaved Notch1. Notch may be a direct target of acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Indeed, it was shown that the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) is stabilized by acetylation, leading to increased signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], with reversible acetylation achieved by the Sirt1 deacetylase. Our results suggest that HDAC1 and HDAC2 could be involved directly or indirectly in modulating Notch activity, thus regulating IEC determination.</p><p>Second, HDAC1/2 impairment leads to increased intestinal growth. Small intestine weight and length, as well as colon weight, is increased, and this correlates with increased IEC proliferation and migration, as assessed by in vivo BrdU labelling experiments. Increased IEC proliferation may stem in part from Notch activation. Indeed, expression of an activated Notch1 receptor in IECs leads to increased BrdU positive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], while Notch1 and Notch2 receptor double knockout in IECs leads to a reduced number of proliferating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In addition, Notch activity is required for intestinal epithelial regeneration following DSS-induced colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Another pathway which could be involved in IEC proliferation is the mTOR pathway, as suggested by increased phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, a downstream target of the S6kinase which is activated by mTOR. The mTOR kinase senses cellular nutrient and energy levels, and stimulates cell growth accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Acetylation may regulate mTOR signalling. Indeed, acetylation of the catalytic subunit of the AMP-activated kinase, Prkaa1, a negative regulator of mTORC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], inhibits AMPK activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In contrast, AMPK deacetylation by HDAC1 increases Lkb1 kinase-dependent phosphorylation and activation of AMPK. Thus, HDAC1/2 ablation in IECs could disrupt mTOR signalling by inhibiting AMPK activity.</p><p>Third, IEC-restricted HDAC1/2 disruption leads to chronic intestinal inflammation in the colon, with colitis symptoms such as decreased weight, looser stools and colon shortening, as well as immune cell infiltrates and altered expression of immune related genes in colon, as assessed by microarray and RNA expression analysis, and elevated phosphorylation of the transcription factor Stat3, a regulator of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This chronic inflammatory response may be caused by differentiation defects causing abnormal expression of cell junctional proteins. Indeed, mutant mice show increased intestinal permeability, suggesting altered barrier function. Furthermore, our data show that mutant mice display altered numbers of goblet and Paneth cells, as well as impaired expression of differentiated cell-specific genes. Goblet cells produce anti-microbial peptides and mucins which limit bacterial adhesion to the epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The importance of mucus for IEC homeostasis is demonstrated by the spontaneous colitis generated in Mucin 2 deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Likewise, Paneth cells produce antimicrobial proteins, such as &#x003b1;-defensins, which limit microbial challenges and pattern resident microbial populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Thus, differentiation deficiencies in IEC-specific HDAC1/2 knockout mice may lead to altered responses to the microbial environment. Of note, this inflammatory environment may contribute to IEC proliferation increases observed in mutant mice, as proposed in other intestinal inflammatory models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>While normal intestinal homeostasis is disrupted and normal protective functions are impaired, our gene expression analysis reveals the establishment of a novel equilibrium controlling in part the inflammatory response in IEC-specific HDAC1/2 deficient mice. For example, the REG family of C-type lectins is highly expressed. One member of this family, Reg3g, expressed by IECs under inflammatory conditions, is a secreted bactericidal lectin against Gram-positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], which segregates the microbiota from the epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Another example is the increased expression of Alpi, considered a protective factor dephosphorylating bacterial lypopolysaccharides, thus reducing endotoxic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and limiting bacterial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>HDAC1 and HDAC2, as well as acetyltransferases contribute to the formation of the acetylome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. The acetylome is regulated by endogenous as well as exogenous signals. It has been shown that levels of the substrate donor acetyl-CoA vary according to metabolic cues such as nutrient availability, leading to different levels of acetyltransferase activities and protein acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In addition, HDAC activities are regulated by endogenous cell inhibitors. For example, fasting increases production of the &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate metabolite, which inhibits class I HDACs, including HDAC1 and HDAC2, leading to increased histone acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Furthermore, the acetylome is subject to regulation by the intestinal microbial environment. Acetate, produced by microbial fermentation, may directly contribute to endogenous acetyl-CoA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Another microbial fermentation product, butyrate, is an HDAC inhibitor, leading to increased histone acetylation levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Finally, recent data have shown that reintroduction of gut bacteria in gnotobiotic mice increases the number of lysine acetylated proteins in colon as well as liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Thus, acetyl-CoA levels and exogenous as well as endogenous metabolites affect protein acetylation, in part by regulating HDAC activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Thus, HDAC1 and HDAC2 may contribute to the transmission of endogenous as well as exogenous signals to the IEC acetylome.</p><p>We have uncovered, for the first time, an intriguingly specific HDAC1- and HDAC2-dependent phenotype, with intestinal growth, differentiation and cell fate determination alterations in IEC-specific conditional mutant mice. We have shown that IEC-specific deletion of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 may alter Notch and mTOR signalling pathways, among others, leading to chronic inflammation and disturbed homeostasis. Our findings suggest that HDAC1 and HDAC2 restrain the intestinal inflammatory response, and regulate intestinal epithelial cell polarity, proliferation and differentiation. HDAC1 and HDAC2 may well play important roles in relaying endogenous as well as exogenous cues to IECs and the intestinal mucosa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0073785.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Conditional intestinal epithelial HDAC1/2 loss leads to weight reduction. </p><p>Four-month-old control and conditional intestinal epithelial HDAC1/2 male and female mice were weighed.
