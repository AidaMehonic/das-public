We initially screened a number of PMC analogs for their cytotoxic effects on HCT116 human colon cancer cells. PMC-A, the analog with the most potent antiproliferative effect was chosen to further interrogate the underlying mechanism of action. PMC-A led to apoptosis through activation of caspase-9 and -3. The apoptotic nature of cell death was confirmed by abrogation of cell death with pretreatment with specific caspase inhibitors. Stress-related MAPKs JNK and p38 were both activated concomittantly with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of p38 proved to attenuate the cell death induction while pretreatment with JNK inhibitor did not exhibit a protective effect. Resistance of Bax &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells and the protective nature of caspase-9 inhibition indicate that mitochondria play a central role in PMC-A induced apoptosis. Early post-exposure elevation of cellular Bim and Bax was followed by a marginal Bcl-2 depletion and Bid cleavage. Further analysis revealed that Bcl-2 downregulation occurs at the mRNA level and is critical to mediate PMC-A induced apoptosis, as ectopic Bcl-2 expression substantially spared the cells from death. Conversely, forced expression of Bim proved to significantly increase cell death. In addition, analyses of p53&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells demonstrated that Bcl-2/Bim/Bax modulation and MAPK activations take place independently of p53 expression. Taken together, p53-independent transcriptional Bcl-2 downregulation and p38 signaling appear to be the key modulatory events in PMC-A induced apoptosis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The funding for the work was provided by Sabanci University faculty research funds.

Having long been exploited as disinfectants and preservatives in industry, antifungal agents have not been exceptions to this. Pramanicin (PMC) is a fungal fermentation product belonging to a class of antifungal agents defined by a highly functionilized polar head and an aliphatic side chain. The previous <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses on cultured endothelial and leukemic T-cells confirmed its therapeutic potential both as an antiangiogenic and anticancer agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Kwan1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Kutuk1">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Prolonged exposure to <italic>in vitro</italic> effective doses of PMC was previously shown to decrease cell viability and trigger caspase-dependent apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Kutuk1">[2]</xref>. PMC-induced cell death was demonstrated to be mediated by activation of both stress-related kinases p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) while extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) activity was reported to significantly decrease upon exposure to the agent. Although a transient intracellular calcium increase was reported to follow PMC exposure in cultured pulmonary endothelial cells, this phenomenon was not synchronized with either endothelial dysfunction or cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Kwan1">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Physical or chemical environmental stresses including radiation, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress or cell surface receptor ligands such as growth factors, inflammatory cytokines or death receptor ligands may activate a kinase cascade which eventually stimulates stress-activated MAPKs p38 and JNK. Upstream serine/threonine kinases MAP kinase kinase kinases (MEKKs) and MAP kinase kinases (MKKs) are responsible for activation by phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of JNK and p38 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Blank1">[3]</xref>. Once activated, JNK and p38 are known to be capable of apoptotic modulation through activating/deactivating a series of transcription factors.</p><p>Apoptosis is a tightly regulated cell death mechanism which is activated in response to various intra-/extracellular stimuli such as oxidative stress and electromagnetic radiation that damage cellular macromolecules or signals including inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Apoptotic execution is assumed by a family of cysteine proteases called caspases that are activated in a well-defined manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Nunez1">[4]</xref>. While the intrinsic pathway is triggered by apoptogenic molecule release from mitochondria, the extrinsic pathway is activated through ligand binding to death receptors on the cell surface. Whether the intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic pathway will be in action is generally determined by the nature of the stimulus. Independent of the pathway that was activated initially, both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways could be involved to amplify the apoptotic signal in different circumstances.</p><p>Cytochrome c release from mitochondria which marks the point of no return for intrinsic apoptotic activity is intricately regulated by interactions among Bcl-2 family of proteins. The delicate balance between the anti- and proapoptotic members of the family determines the apoptotic load within the cell. Multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bax and Bak have the ability of homo-/heterooligomerization at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) which causes permeabilization of the OMM and release of apoptogenic molecules including cytochrome c into the cytosol. While the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, A1 and Mcl-1 keep proapoptotic Bax/Bak sequestered preventing them from initiating OMM permeabilization, proapoptotic BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3)-only proteins including Bim, Bid, Noxa, Bad and Puma could work to neutralize the antiapoptotic members of the family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Kim1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Willis1">[6]</xref>. Although the exact mechanisms modulating Bcl-2 proteins still remain obscure to a large extent, the balance between relative cellular amounts and activities of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is known to be strictly controlled at the gene and protein levels in healthy mammalian cells. In this regard, cellular levels of proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 proteins relative to their antiapoptotic counterparts is critical to set Bax/Bak free to initiate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.</p><p>In addition to its roles in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, the well-known tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to be able to directly regulate apoptosis. So far, this regulation has been demonstrated to occur via modulation of Bcl-2 family protein or death receptor expressions. In addition to transcriptionally upregulating Bax, Bid, Puma, Noxa, Bak and transmembrane death receptors as a transcription factor, p53 was also reported to be capable of directly activating Bax at the protein level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Miyashita1">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Sheikh1">[13]</xref>. Recent evidence also indicates that p53 itself may also behave as a BH3-only proapoptotic protein to antagonize antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins as well as causing transrepression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Erster1">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Wu1">[17]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we define a mechanism for intrinsic apoptotic pathway activation triggered by PMC-A, a potent PMC analog in which the epoxy group on the side chain of PMC is replaced by an alkene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056369-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). PMC-A mediated apoptosis through p53-independent activation of p38 and Bcl-2 downregulation in HCT-116 human colon cancer cells.

Failure of surveillance/maintanence over cell fate decision could result in malignant transformation. Evasion from apoptosis as a hallmark of cancerous cells may involve dysregulation of Bcl-2 family proteins as evidence indicates that a wide variety of solid and hematopoietic tumors rely on elevated antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression for survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Vogler1">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Wei1">[36]</xref>. In this view, inspection of cellular levels and activation statuses of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins may provide valuable clues about anticancer drug action.As a result, interest in Bcl-2 family regulation by putative or established chemotherapetics has been increasing. The materialisation of the idea of interfering with expressions/activities of specific Bcl-2 targets in cancerous cells challenges us to develop a complete understanding of the behaviour of Bcl-2 proteins in response to different anticancer agents in various neoplasms. Although use of antisense oligonucleotides has been challenged with efficient drug delivery issues in clinical trials, significant achievements of non-peptidic small molecule inhibitors (SMI) of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are ensuring the acceleration of efforts to design Bcl-2 manipulation-based therapeutic approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Weecharangsan1">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Bodur1">[44]</xref>.</p><p>This study is the second investigation to implicate PMC analogs in anticancer activity with the aim of elucidating the basic mechanism of the induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Kutuk1">[2]</xref>. Although having being studied in normal vascular endothelial and leukemic T cells, pramanicin analogs was yet to be tested for anticancer action against solid cancer models.

PMC-A was further confirmed to induce cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056369-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Early post-exposure activations of apical caspase-9 and subsequent executioner caspase-3 together with abrogation of PMC-A induced cell death upon pretreatment with pharmacological caspase-3 and general caspase inhibitors clearly indicate the apoptotic nature of the induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056369-g004">Fig. 4B, C</xref>).</p><p>Roughly inspecting the time course of Bcl-2-modulatory events showed early Bim and Bax upregulation followed by Bcl-2 downregulation and late truncation of Bid. Forced expression analyses of Bim and Bcl-2 ended up with identification of Bcl-2 downregulation and Bim upregulation as important mediators of PMC-A triggered apoptosis. Ectopic expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 prevented HCT116 cells from cell death to a large extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056369-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). On the other hand, although apoptotic promotion was significant, ectopic expression of proapoptotic Bim appeared to be less effective compared to Bcl-2 in modulating apoptosis. Given the fact that the elevation of cellular Bim and Bax precedes Bcl-2 downregulation, roles of these earlier events should not be underestimated. Bim, as an activator Bcl-2 protein, is capable of direct Bax/Bak activation upon reversible binding and known to potently antagonize all prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins which sequester Bax/Bak under normal circumstances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Kim1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Willis1">[6]</xref>.

The time course of Bcl-2 downregulation roughly marks 8 hours post-exposure as the start point of this regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056369-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Since caspase-9 activation precedes Bcl-2 downregulation, Bcl-2 depletion may not be the first event to lead OMM permeabilization, but apparently plays a substantial role in amplification of the apoptotic response. In this view, early upregulation of Bim and Bax appear to initiate caspase cascade activation through OMM permeabilization. Further investigation of PMC-A induced Bcl-2 downregulation by qRT-PCR indicated that expression of Bcl-2 was significantly repressed at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056369-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Investigation of the roles of stress-activated kinases revealed that pretreatment with specific p38 pharmacological inhibitor proved to abrogate PMC-A mediated Bcl-2 downregulation while JNK inhibition did not affect the induced modulations on Bcl-2, Bim or Bax (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0056369.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Among the transcription factors, NF-&#x003ba;B, SP1, p53 and AP-2 (activating protein-2) which all were previously shown to be activated by p38 kinase activity in various cellular scenarios were implicated in direct transcriptional regulation of Bcl-2 in stressed cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Wu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Wajapeyee1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Dong1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Heckman1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Lim1">[64]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Tuli1">[67]</xref>. While NF-&#x003ba;B and SP1 are generally implicated in transactivation of the BCL-2 gene, p53 and AP-2a were demonstrated to be responsible for transcriptional repression of Bcl-2. Relevant to our analysis, knockdown studies and further interrogation of nuclear import and activation statuses of aforementioned apoptotic modulator transcription factors, especially AP-2a, could provide further insights into the anticancer mechanism of action of PMC analogs at the nuclear level.</p><p>Bid cleavage is a well-known apoptotic event linking the extrinsic apoptotic pathway to the intrinsic apoptotic route to amplify the apoptotic signal. Procaspase-8 is activated through a sequence of events including recruitment of adaptor molecules, homooligomerization and autocatalytic cleavage upon engagement of death receptors on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Nunez1">[4]</xref>. Active caspase-8 which stands at the apex of the extrinsic apoptotic route contributes to procaspase-3 processing and synchronously activates BH3-only protein Bid by cleavage to initiate OMM permeabilization. Our analysis shows that Bid cleavage took place at fairly late hours following PMC-A treatment in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056369-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Late involvement of Bid cleavage and failure of caspase-8 inhibitor pretreatment to blunt PMC-A mediated apoptosis, makes us speculate that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated secondary to the intrinsic apoptotic route (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0056369.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Indeed, rather than being driven by a death receptor binding, such a secondary involvement of the extrinsic apoptotic route could have taken place as a result of cleavage of procaspase-8 by caspase-3 which was already activated by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway at the very beginning of PMC-A exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Slee1">[68]</xref>.</p><p>Although it would be tempting to argue that PMC-A mediated Bcl-2 family regulation is related with tumor suppressor p53 signaling, all the above mentioned modulations were also apparent, at least at the protein level, in p53-null cells. However, it should be noted that Bid cleavage was visible only at 24 h post-exposure in cells lacking p53 expression while in wt cells the cleavage was evident as early as 8 hours after PMC-A treatment. This quicker response in the involvement of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in wt cells could possibly be related with p53-dependent death receptor gene transactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0056369-Ryan1">[69]</xref>. Although Bax is known to be a direct target of p53 transcription factor, the time course of cellular Bax elevation was similar in both wt and p53&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells upon PMC-A treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056369-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Similarly, both Bim upregulation and Bcl-2 downregulation followed almost identical patterns independently of p53 expression in cells.</p><p>In brief, this study demostrates that PMC analogs display chemotherapeutic potential in addition to their previously shown potential against <italic>in vitro</italic> hematopoietic malignancy models. We define a p53-independent modulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins as the mediator of PMC-A induced apoptosis. PMC-A rapidly induces the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through upregulation of Bax and Bim which is followed by a dramatic Bcl-2 downregulation and Bid truncation. The central role of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was further confirmed by the protective effects of Bcl-2 overexpression and caspase-9 inhibition prior to PMC-A treatment. In addition to shedding light upon the apoptotic action mechanism of PMC-A, these results could also prove invaluable for tailoring therapeutic approaches against solid cancers. By revealing Bcl-2 downregulation as the basic mechanism of action of PMC-A to promote apoptosis, this study also provides supporting evidence for justification of clinical trials based on antisense/SMI strategies directed against Bcl-2 protein in various cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0056369.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Pre-treatment with specific p38 inhibitor reverses PMC-A mediated Bcl-2 downregulation.</bold> HCT116 wt cells were pretreated with indicated concentrations of JNK (SP600125), p38 MAPK (SB203580) or IKK inhibitors for 30 min, treated with 50 &#x000b5;M PMC-A, collected at 4 h (Bax/Bim) or 24 h (Bcl-2), lysed and immunoblotted using anti-Bax, anti-Bim, anti-Bcl-2 and anti-&#x003b2;-actin antibodies. &#x003b2;-actin was used as loading control.
