They are thought to act as tumor suppressors by lowering growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic proteins. In order to measure cellular let-7 levels systematically, we have developed a highly sensitive let-7 reporter assay system based on the expression of a chimeric mRNA that contains the luciferase coding region and a 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) bearing two let-7-binding sites. In cells expressing the reporter construct, termed pmirGLO-let7, luciferase activity was high when let-7 was absent, while luciferase activity was low when let-7 levels were elevated. The ovarian cancer cell lines BG-1 and UCI-101 were transfected with the let-7 reporter and surveyed with a library of kinase inhibitors in order to identify pathways affecting let-7 activity. Among the inhibitors causing changes in endogenous let-7 abundance, the lowering of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3)&#x003b2; function specifically increased let-7 levels and lowered luciferase activity. Similarly, silencing GSK-3&#x003b2; increased both mature and primary-let-7 levels in BG-1 cells, and decreased BG-1 cell survival. Further studies identified p53 as a downstream effector of the GSK-3&#x003b2;-mediated repression of let-7 biosynthesis. Our studies highlight GSK-3&#x003b2; as a novel therapeutic target in ovarian tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was funded entirely by the National Institute on Aging-Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health.

The high mortality rate of ovarian cancer is partly due to the late-stage diagnosis and the high prevalence of drug resistance among ovarian cancer patients. Molecular markers for early screening and targeted therapy would thus permit more effective ways to combat this malignancy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic molecules in a number of disease processes including cancer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-NanaSinkam1">[1]</xref>). These noncoding regulatory RNAs, spanning &#x0223c;22 nucleotides, have been implicated in key regulatory functions in many species. By binding to complementary sequences in target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), miRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression through translational repression and/or mRNA decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Fabian1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Djuranovic1">[3]</xref>.

The transcripts encoding the three human Ras proteins (<italic>NRAS</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>HRAS</italic> mRNAs), as well as <italic>HMGA2</italic> mRNA, all have let-7 binding sequences (named &#x02018;let-7 complementary sites&#x02019; or LCS) in their 3&#x02032;-untranslated regions (UTRs) which affect Ras and HMGA2 expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Johnson1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Mayr1">[23]</xref>. Based on these studies, let-7 family members are believed to function as tumor suppressors. Accordingly, high Ras levels correlated with low let-7 levels in lung tumors but not in normal adjacent tissues, and HMGA2 acquired mutations that removed let-7 binding sites in tumors, thus avoiding let-7-mediated tumor suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Johnson1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Mayr1">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the clear inverse correlation between let-7 levels and cancer, the mechanisms that control let-7 abundance in tumors are poorly understood. Like other miRNAs, expression of the let-7 family is first regulated at the level of transcription, with the synthesis of a long primary (pri)-miRNA by RNA polymerase II. The pri-miRNA processing complex (the &#x02018;microprocessor&#x02019;), which includes the RNase III enzyme Drosha and its partner DGCR8, cleaves the pri-miRNA into 70-nt long precursor (pre)-miRNAs, which are transported to the cytoplasm by the nuclear export protein Exportin 5. Another RNase III enzyme, Dicer, subsequently cleaves pre-miRNA into the functional, &#x0223c;22-nt long mature miRNA. The mature miRNA binds argonaute (Ago) and other proteins to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which specifically interacts with the target mRNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Winter1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Ketting1">[27]</xref>).</p><p>The transcriptional control of let-7 biosynthesis has already implicated numerous transcription factors, including c-Myc, p53, and NF-&#x003ba;B. c-Myc can bind to various enhancers of the let-7a1&#x0223c;let-7d cluster (for eventual synthesis of let-7a1, let-7f1, and let-7d), and can both activate and inhibit cluster promoter activity, depending on enhancer activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Chang1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Wang2">[29]</xref>. p53 binds directly to the let-7a3 and let-7b gene enhancer and represses let-7a and let-7b expression in HCT116 colon cancer cells in response to radiation and oxidative stress, while NF-&#x003ba;B induces expression from the let-7a/b endogenous promoter by binding to the basal let-7 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Saleh1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Wang3">[31]</xref>. The lack of correlation between the expression levels of pri-let-7 and mature let-7 miRNA observed sometimes suggests that let-7 is also subject to post-transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Pasquinelli1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Thomson1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Wulczyn1">[33]</xref>. One of the best characterized post-transcriptional repressors of let-7 is the RNA-binding protein Lin28, which has two paralogs in mammalian cells, Lin28A and Lin28B. Lin28A is present in the cytoplasm and blocks Dicer processing of pre-let-7 by inducing terminal uridylation of pre-let-7, while Lin28B is nuclear and sequesters pri-let-7, blocking its nuclear processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Heo1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Piskounova1">[35]</xref>.

Since kenpaullone, and in general the drugs in our screen, were not selective inhibitors of a single kinase, we sought further insight into the function of GSK-3&#x003b2; as regulator of let-7 expression by knocking down GSK-3&#x003b2; in BG-1 cells using small interfering (si)RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066330-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

Among the reporter constructs we examined, pmirGLO-let7, containing two let-7 sites separated by 27 nucleotides, as well as pmirGLO-let7(s), which only differed in having the let-7 sites separated by a shorter (10-nt) spacer, showed the highest sensitivity to changes in let-7 levels. Other reporters with more complex 3&#x02032;UTRs were less responsive to let-7, likely due to the presence of other regulatory sites on the 3&#x02032;UTR which masked the relative influence of let-7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066330.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Under a variety of conditions, pmirGLO-let7 was found to permit the rapid screen of let-7 levels, or perhaps a more valuable parameter: &#x02018;let-7 available for repression&#x02019;.</p><p>Using one of the two more responsive reporter constructs, pmirGLO-let7, we screened a library of inhibitor compounds in order to identify kinases which influenced let-7 abundance in BG-1 cells. This analysis revealed that a GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibitor, kenpaullone, lowered luciferase activity, a reflection of higher let-7 levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0066330-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066330-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Since Kenpaullone was not a specific inhibitor of GSK-3&#x003b2; (it can also inhibit, at higher concentrations, kinases lck, cdk1, cdk2, cdk5, c-Src, casein kinase II, ERK1, and ERK2), we asked if GSK-3&#x003b2; controlled let-7 levels by silencing GSK-3&#x003b2;. Indeed, these experiments recapitulated the effects of the drug, as lowering GSK-3&#x003b2; expression similarly lowered luciferase activity and elevated the levels of all mature forms of let-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066330-g002">Figs. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066330-g003">3</xref>). Moreover, GSK-3&#x003b2; appeared to modulate mature let-7 levels mainly by controlling the transcription of the different let-7 genes, since the levels of the primary transcripts (pri-let-7s) were also selectively upregulated after silencing GSK-3&#x003b2;, and the differential stability of the pri-let-7 transcripts did not explain the increase in mature let-7 levels.</p><p>The precise transcriptional mechanisms through which GSK-3&#x003b2; represses let-7 levels are not fully understood. However, among the different transcription factors that are downstream effectors of GSK-3&#x003b2; &#x02013; prominently &#x003b2;-catenin, although it is frequently undetectable or very low in ovarian cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Furlong1">[48]</xref> &#x02013; we identified p53 as a regulator of let-7 transcription. p53 had been shown to regulate the transcription of several let-7 variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Tarasov1">[47]</xref> and was proposed to be a potential transcriptional regulator of other let-7 variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Boominathan1">[49]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that GSK-3&#x003b2; silencing upregulated all let-7 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066330-g003">Figure 3</xref>), although we did not fully examine if p53 was responsible for each of these regulatory events.</p><p>How p53 levels rise after silencing GSK-3&#x003b2; also remains to be studied in detail. Indeed, the mechanisms whereby GSK-3&#x003b2; regulate p53 expression and function are still controversial. While some evidence supports a role for GSK-3&#x003b2; as an inducer of p53 levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Jacobs1">[50]</xref>, there are numerous examples of GSK-3&#x003b2; suppressing p53 levels. For instance, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress enhanced GSK-3&#x003b2; function, which then led to p53 phosphorylation on Ser 376 (pS376), accelerating p53 degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Stavridi1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Seo1">[52]</xref>. Similarly, lowering GSK-3&#x003b2; activity increased p53 function in colorectal cancer cells linked to apoptosis and tumor suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Ghosh1">[45]</xref>, while GSK-3&#x003b2;-mediated phosphorylation of Mdm2, a protein required for p53 degradation, triggered the rapid degradation of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Kulikov1">[53]</xref>. In the system studied here, perhaps silencing GSK-3&#x003b2; blocked the Mdm2-elicited decay of p53, allowing p53 to accumulate; this possibility as well as other mechanisms of p53 upregulation, await further investigation.</p><p>Since GSK-3&#x003b2; is a pleiotropic kinase with a broad range of functions, it also appears to have multiple types of impact on carcinogenesis, with evidence supporting its tumorigenic influence and other evidence suggesting that it can inhibit tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Kitano1">[54]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Farago1">[62]</xref>. Our results support a role for GSK-3&#x003b2; in promoting cell survival, since silencing GSK-3&#x003b2; increased p53 expression and elevated cell death, and therefore a pro-tumorigenic influence. In this regard, pharmaceutical inhibitors of GSK-3&#x003b2; may have therapeutic benefit in ovarian cancer. Whether the effects of GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibition on cell survival are dependent, at least in part, on the upregulation of let-7 levels remains to be investigated. Likewise, the specific let-7 targets involved in the growth reduction in BG-1 cells await identification. It also remains to be studied whether GSK-3&#x003b2; regulates acute changes in let-7 levels, perhaps in response to stimuli that induce or inhibit GSK-3&#x003b2; function.</p><p>Finally, p53 and let-7 are well-known enhancers of cellular senescence. In this context, the discovery that inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; also brings about cellular senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066330-Seo1">[52]</xref> raises the possibility that the reduction in cell number seen by lowering GSK-3&#x003b2; is mediated at least in part through the induction of p53 and let-7. The tools introduced in this report will help with the investigation of let-7 levels and the pathways that control its rich biological actions in different physiologic and pathologic settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0066330.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Construction of luciferase reporters.</bold>
