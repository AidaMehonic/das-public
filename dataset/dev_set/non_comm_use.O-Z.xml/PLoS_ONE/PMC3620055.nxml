We have previously reported centrobin (<italic>centro</italic>some <italic>B</italic>RCA2-<italic>in</italic>teracting protein) truncation at the C-terminus in the <italic>hd</italic> mutant. Here, we report data from a transgenic rescue experiment carried out to determine a role of centrobin in pathogenesis of <italic>hd</italic>. The transgenic construct, consisting of full-length-coding cDNA linked to a ubiquitous strong promoter/enhancer combination, was inserted to chromosome 16 into a LINE repeat. No known gene is present in the vicinity of the insertion site. Transgenic centrobin was expressed in all tissues tested, including testis. Transgenic animals show normal body weight and limb morphology as well as average weight of testis and epididymis. Yet, abnormal spermatogenesis and sperm decapitation persisted in the transgenic animals. Western blotting showed the coexistence of full-length and truncated or partially degraded centrobin in sperm of the rescued transgenic animals. Immunocytochemistry showed a buildup of centrobin and ODF2 (outer dense fiber 2) at the sperm decapitation site in the <italic>hd</italic> mutant and rescued transgenic rats. Additional findings included bulge-like formations and thread-like focal dissociations along the sperm flagellum and the organization of multiple whorls of truncated sperm flagella in the epididymal lumen. We conclude that centrobin is essential for normal patterning of the limb autopod. Centrobin may be required for stabilizing the attachment of the sperm head to flagellum and for maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm flagellum. We postulate that the presence of truncated centrobin, coexisting with full-length centrobin, together with incorrect timing of transgenic centrobin expression may hamper the rescue of fertility in <italic>hd</italic> male rats.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was partially supported by Ministry of Education Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.msmt.cz">www.msmt.cz</ext-link>) grant No. ME10034 to FL; by Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mzcr.cz/">http://www.mzcr.cz/</ext-link>) grant No. NT/12269-5 to FL; USPHS HD36477 to LLT and HD37282 to ALK.

Male factor is a major contributing cause in about half of the cases of infertility. About half of human male infertility cases remain idiopathic despite advances in clinical diagnostics. Some of the infertility cases are thought to be of genetic origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Matzuk1">[2]</xref>. Several genes involved in male fertility have been identified using animal models, in particular mouse targeted mutations and spontaneous mutations/transgenic models of mice and other mammals. Mutated genes can cause either standalone or syndromic male infertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Matzuk1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Lika1">[3]</xref>. These mutations were shown to disrupt multiple steps of spermatogenesis and sperm function. Consequently, the identification and characterization of novel proteins involved in sperm development are key issues leading to a better understanding of presently unknown causes of male infertility.</p><p>Spermiogenesis is a complex postmeiotic phase of spermatogenesis. It involves the development of round spermatids into mature spermatids, consisting of elongated heads with an acrosome-acroplaxome complex anchored to the nucleus. The head is attached to the flagellum by the head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA). The distal centriole of the HTCA degenerates in rodent sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Manandhar1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Woolley1">[5]</xref>. The sperm flagellum consists of an axoneme surrounded by mitochondria at its head proximal segment, the middle piece, and characteristic peri-axoneme outer dense fibers along the entire length of the flagellum and a fibrous sheath in the principal piece. The annulus marks the transition from the mitochondria-containing middle piece to the principal piece of the sperm flagellum. Mature spermatids are released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule by the process of spermiation, assisted by the apical domain of Sertoli cells, and undergo a maturation process in the epididymis defined by the acquisition of forward motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-KangDecker1">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Yao1">[8]</xref>. The orderly sequence of sperm development and maturation requires the timely expression, intramanchette transport (spermatids) and intraflagellar transport (spermatids and sperm) of proteins and their precise assembly and stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Kierszenbaum1">[9]</xref>. Several genes encoding specific proteins have been identified as essential for spermiogenesis. One of these genes is <italic>Cntrob</italic> (centrobin, for centrosome BRCA2 interacting protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Zou1">[10]</xref>). <italic>Cntrob</italic> encodes a protein with a central coiled-coil region flanked by noncoiled regions at the NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini. Centrobin is a daughter centriole protein essential for centrosome duplication and elongation, two functions depending on centrobin-tubulin interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Gudi1">[11]</xref>. Centrobin regulates the attachment of the mitotic spindle to the centrosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Jeffery1">[12]</xref>, a condition essential for the stability of microtubules anchored to the kinetochore on metaphase chromosomes during separation of their chromatids. These properties are lost in centrobin-depleted cells that subsequently undergo apoptosis. When overexpressed, centrobin forms bundle-like structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Zou1">[10]</xref>. The reported centrobin-microtubule association mimics a similar condition seen in spermatids and sperm, wherein centrobin associates transiently with the microtubule-containing manchette and with the centrosome and axoneme of the developing sperm flagellum.</p><p>We have previously reported the spontaneous mutation of <italic>Cntrob</italic> encoding truncated centrobin in rat hypodactyly (<italic>hd</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Liska1">[13]</xref>. A major defect during late spermiogenesis in the <italic>hd</italic> mutant is the detachment in maturing spermatids of the developing flagella from their HTCA, an event that leads to massive decapitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Liska1">[13]</xref>. The HTCA can be regarded as a specialized centrosome surrounded by specific proteins, some of them presently unknown. The HTCA consists of a proximal centriole anchored to the spermatid nucleus and a distal centriole from which the microtubule-containing flagellum axoneme originates. Outer dense fibers and a fibrous sheath encircle the sperm axoneme. Basically, the structure and function of the HTCA resembles the centrosome, the putative site of the mitotic spindle. Centrobin is an addition to the catalog of proteins with a potential role in the integrity of the HTCA, a site leading to the &#x0201c;easily decapitated sperm syndrome&#x0201d; in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Baccetti1">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Toyama1">[19]</xref>. In addition to the <italic>hd</italic> rat mutant, other rodent models also display sperm decapitation at the HTCA site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Tokuhiro1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Yang1">[21]</xref>. However, it remains to be determined the specific role of centrobin as a single protein or/and as part of protein complexes during the assembly and stability of the HTCA. This aim can facilitate the identification of subclinical forms of male infertility involving sperm head-tail fragility leading to decapitation during micromanipulation as part of in vitro reproductive assisted technologies.</p><p>To pursue further a better understanding of centrobin&#x02019;s role in sperm decapitation, we attempted to rescue <italic>hd</italic> by transgenesis using a construct encoding full-length centrobin protein. We have found that limb malformation was completely rescued but sperm decapitation persisted in the transgenic males. Yet, we have made progress in determining additional structural and immunocytochemical parameters concerning the contribution of centrobin to sperm development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were compliant with the Animal Protection Law of the Czech Republic (311/1997) which is in compliance with the European Community Council recommendations for the use of laboratory animals 86/609/ECC, and were approved by The Charles University Animal Care Committee.

We could not detect significant differences in the decapitation pattern of rescued and <italic>hd</italic> mutant sperm. Yet, we observed structural changes as well as differences in the immunoreactive pattern of centrobin and ODF2 along the sperm flagellum pointing to a role of centrobin in stabilizing the association of ODFs to the axoneme. A significant structural finding was the series of sperm flagellum bulges housing centrobin but not ODF2. ODF2 was restricted to the inter-bulge connecting segments, which showed a tendency to break up into thread-like formations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060859-g005"><bold>Figure 5F,G</bold></xref>). It is likely that the bulges along the sperm flagellum of the rescued <italic>Tg+ hd/hd</italic> rats develop to house excess full-length centrobin coexisting with endogenous truncated centrobin and other proteins. A high concentration of centrobin in the bulges may disrupt the intraflagellar transport of centrobin and other proteins to the required assembly sites. As a result, segments of the flagellum become less stable. Examples of these proposed mechanism could be the distinct thread-like dissociation sites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060859-g005"><bold>Figure 5F,G</bold></xref><bold>),</bold> the fragmentation and dispersion of outer dense fibers (see <bold>dashed boxes</bold> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060859-g004"><bold>Figure 4I</bold></xref>), and the release into the epididymal lumen of spherical bodies containing dissociated outer dense fibers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060859-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref><bold> G&#x02013;I</bold>).</p><p>It is also possible that centrobin may stabilize the association of outer dense fibers to the microtubule-containing axoneme. The sperm head-tail attachment site consists of centriolar microtubules and pericentriolar proteins developing the HTCA. ODF2 and centrobin are components of the HTCA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Liska1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Rivkin1">[24]</xref>. The presence of large aggregates of centrobin and ODF2 at the HTCA site (see <bold>centrobin</bold> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060859-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref><bold>,D,E</bold> and <bold>ODF2</bold> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060859-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref><bold>, L,M</bold>) suggests a disruption in the transport of these two proteins along the developing flagellum. In fact, bundles of thin flagella seen in testis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060859-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref><bold>,H,I</bold> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060859-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref><bold>,L,M</bold>) and prominent whorls of flagella seen in epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060859-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref><bold>,E,F and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060859-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref><bold>,I</bold>) indicate that decapitation occurs to a large extend before completion of flagellar development. Decapitated flagella find it easy to form multiple whorls and undergo a degradation process in the epididymal environment resulting in the formation of multiple spherical bodies.</p><p>Recently two targeted gene inactivation experiments were reported to result in sperm head decapitation, Odf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Yang1">[21]</xref> and Oaz3 (OAZ-t) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Tokuhiro1">[20]</xref>. Odf1 is a major component of the outer dense fibers. Odf1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice show isolated deficiency of morphogenesis of elongated spermatids. In addition to deficiency of, the flagella show disturbed mitochondrial sheath and dislodged outer dense fibers. Interestingly, detached flagella retain some motility. <italic>hd</italic> mutants as well as <italic>Cntrob</italic> transgenes similarly to Odf1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> display outer dense fiber disorganization (thread-like dissociation of ODF2 positive material). Also limited motility of the detached flagella can be observed in fresh preparations of caput epididymidis sperm (unpublished data) indicating (limited) functionality of detached tails. On the other hand, distinct coiling of the flagellum typical for Odf1&#x02212;/&#x02212; sperm was not observed neither in <italic>hd</italic> nor in <italic>Cntrob</italic> transgenic rats, that instead form whorls of multiple flagella. OAZ3 is an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase likely regulating local content of polyamines in the developing sperm. Oaz3 deficient mice show easy separation of heads from flagella. There are few points of interest &#x02013; ultrastructure of the flagellum and HTCA is well preserved (in contrast to both Odf1&#x02212;/&#x02212; and hd), detachment is well defined to occur between basal plate of the nuclear envelope and capitulum, nondisrupted sperm can be retrieved from epididymis and lose tails upon incubation, these tails display &#x0201c;mighty motility&#x0201d; up to 15 hours. These comparisons suggest a model, where centrobin participates with Odf1 in building the outer dense fibers, attaching mitochondria and making structurally tough HTCA. Centrobin perhaps is not part of the ODFs themselves as suggested by its relation with Odf2 protein in centrobin transgenes. Polyamines probably act later in final stabilization of the structures of HTCA although the mechanism is speculative. Supportive evidence comes from a study showing that primary amines disrupt head to flagellum connection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Young1">[27]</xref>.</p><p>We are at present unable to demonstrate that <italic>Cntrob</italic> mutation is a direct determinant of decapitation leading to male infertility in <italic>hd</italic> rats. It is possible that, in addition to <italic>Cntrob</italic>, the mutation of another gene may be responsible for sperm decapitation in <italic>hd</italic> rats, or that a negative effect determined by truncated centrobin is not fully compensated or overridden by the coexisting expression of full-length centrobin.</p><p>First possibility of an additional contributing gene would point to one of the remaining 15 genes in the <italic>hd</italic> non-recombinant region as a cause of rat <italic>hd</italic>. However, 4 of the 15 genes are not expressed in the testis and the rest do not contain any mutation in the coding sequence nor any mutation affecting splicing. Also RT-PCR did not indicate any substantial change in the expression of these genes. All available evidence thus still points to the <italic>Cntrob</italic> gene as responsible for male infertility of <italic>hd</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Liska1">[13]</xref>.</p><p>The possibility of interference of the mutant truncated centrobin with full-length transgenic centrobin is not compliant with the fact that heterozygotes <italic>+/hd</italic> show normal fertility and are indistinguishable from wild-type (<italic>+/+</italic>) males suggesting hd allele is operating more like a loss-of-function mutation. Substantial level of centrobin observed in the testis as well as in the sperm of the transgenic males makes this hypothesis unlikely. This finding also excludes epigenetic transgene silencing as the cause of the persisting infertility phenotype, even though the transgene is localized inside a LINE element that may be selectively silenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Bao1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Yoder1">[29]</xref>. On the other hand deficiency in Piwi/piRNA mediated LINE silencing lead to male infertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-KuramochiMiyagawa1">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Carmell1">[32]</xref>, and we may speculate what would happen if the transgenic construct were able to rescue the LINE element at the site of transgene insertion from the silencing process. However; this LINE element (belonging to family L1) is incomplete (lacks 5&#x02032; 1.2 kb and 3&#x02032; 1.5 kb), likely inactive, and thus not direct target of silencing. Therefore, the non-native promoter used is probably deficient in the normal temporal regulation of centrobin expression which may result in centrobin protein expression at the wrong time and possibly in the wrong amount during spermatogenesis, in other words, we can expect dosage sensitivity of centrobin as part of functional protein complexes that would be disrupted either in absence or excess of centrobin. This hypothesis is supported by the finding of impaired localization of centrobin in transgenic rescued rats. An intriguing possibility would be requirement of a different splicing variant of centrobin in spermatids in contrast to somatic cells. However, RT-PCR data do not indicate coexistence of splicing transcript variants encoding full-length and truncated centrobin.</p><p>Further analysis of the mechanism of sperm decapitation and flagella abnormalities is hindered at present by a lack of data concerning centrobin-interacting protein partners during sperm development. It is known that &#x003b1;-tubulin is a centrobin-interacting partner in the centriole and that centrobin-tubulin interaction is necessary for centriole elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Gudi1">[11]</xref>. Since HTCA contains a centriole pair, centrobin may be recruited to HTCA via its tubulin interaction. Furthermore, a deficiency of centrobin intramanchette transport and/or intraflagellar transport (also microtubule-dependent) may result from a failure of centrobin-tubulin interaction determined by dimerization/multimerization of transgenic centrobin. In fact, it is known that over-expression of centrobin results in the formation of protein bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0060859-Zou1">[10]</xref> and our unpublished data), a finding that may explain the tendency of over-expressed centrobin to accumulate in bulges along the sperm flagellum. By dissecting the conundrum of infertility rescue failure, biochemical, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses using the transgenic rats may be invaluable for providing additional insights into the mechanism of sperm decapitation and sperm flagellum abnormalities in the rat model as well as in equivalent phenotypes seen in the infertile human male.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0060859-Boivin1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation
