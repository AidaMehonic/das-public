The caudal brainstem, which is the main recipient of information from the GI tract, is a key region in this control. Particularly during digestion, a complex signaling cascade informs brainstem centers of the nature and quantity of macronutrients entering the organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Norgren1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Both non-specific mechanical and macronutrient-specific meal-related stimuli are sensed in the GI tract, where they induce the release of gut peptides. Gut peptides and absorbed nutrients act either on the sensory vagal afferents that innervate the gut and the hepato-portal area, or directly in the brain through the bloodstream <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Raybould1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Wei1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Within the central nervous system, vagal afferents synapse in the <italic>nucleus tractus solitarii</italic> (NTS) located in the caudal brainstem. In addition, the NTS receives input from the area postrema (AP), which displays elevated permeability of the blood-brain barrier and is sensitive to the blood-borne signals linked to ingested macronutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Maolood1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Nutrient-specific behavioral responses have been observed, suggesting that the brain receives and integrates nutrient-specific signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Tome1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Very little is known about the central encoding modalities of macronutrient-specific detection during digestion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Phifer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This information would be of considerable value to a clearer understanding of the physiological mechanisms that control food intake and its dysfunctions. All macronutrients exert different impacts on food intake control, especially regarding the degree of satiety. There is evidence to suggest that different macronutrients generate specific signals during their absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. For instance, cholecystokinin (CCK) is released in response to the presence of dietary fat and protein in the gut lumen, while serotonin (5-HT) levels rise in response to the presence of carbohydrates and lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Raybould3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Tome1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Liddle1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Hayes1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, by quantifying the proto-oncogene Fos as a marker of neuronal activity, it has been shown that different macronutrients are associated with different levels of activation in the NTS and AP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This effect is positively related to their potency to inhibit food intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Phifer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. According to Phifer et al., activation of the caudal brainstem in correlation with macronutrient detection is dependent on the type of nutrient rather than its caloric value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Phifer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Very few studies have investigated the central encoding modalities of macronutrient-associated signals, and more precisely whether patterns of neuronal activity within the brainstem are specific to macronutrients. We therefore assessed the effects of different macronutrients on Fos expression and investigated whether specific activation patterns could be detected. Following the administration of sucrose or casein peptone, we quantified Fos expression throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the NTS. We compared: a) the total number of Fos-expressing neurons in the brainstem, AP and NTS, b) their distribution along the rostrocaudal axis, and c) the spatial distribution of NTS neurons using three-dimensional reconstructions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Andrey1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and statistical mapping of neuronal population densities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Burguet1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Finally, neurons from the peptone group occupied a narrower volume along the mediolateral axis. In order to assess the degree of overlap between the two populations, we determined their total volume and estimated the portion of this volume that was simultaneously occupied by the two groups.

In this scheme, NTS neurons receiving information from the upper GI tract (i.e. esophagus, stomach and duodenum) are located in the vicinity of the AP.

Although it has been claimed that no functional mapping exists in the NTS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Phifer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, no spatial analyses have been performed in this region. We therefore undertook a three-dimensional study of neuronal activity following the administration of macronutrients. To take account of both experimental and inter-individual variability, a statistical strategy was adopted. We took advantage of a recently reported method for spatial normalization and statistical three-dimensional modeling of neuronal populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Burguet1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> in order to address the question of a possible functional segregation of NTS neurons.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Macronutrient-Elicited Fos Expression in the Brainstem Was Restricted to NTS and AP Neurons</title><p>In both the peptone and sucrose groups, the major contribution of total Fos immunoreactive neurons in the brainstem came from the NTS, with a minor contribution from the AP. The contingent of water-induced Fos-positive neurons was mainly located outside the NTS and AP, and was very limited in these two regions, suggesting that the Fos labeling induced by sucrose and peptone in the NTS and AP was stimulus-specific. Since no Fos immunoreactive neurons were observed when no load was applied, the Fos immunoreactivity observed outside the NTS and AP probably resulted from gastric distension during gavage.

Individual three-dimensional models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008974-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) provided a clearer view of their spatial organization but were not appropriate for comparative analysis. Model normalization and fusion yielded representations of whole experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008974-g004">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>). These fusion models were the superposition of normalized populations. The larger the experimental group, the bigger was the apparent size of the population and the more confused the representation. Therefore, although synthetic, the representations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008974-g004">Figures 4D and 4E</xref> were difficult to analyze visually. Only a computation of density maps made it possible to draw some clearer conclusions. Using this approach, we revealed that two different macronutrients specifically activated two functional subpopulations of NTS neurons. Visual examination of the iso-surfaces extracted from density maps showed a subtle but clear segregation of these neuron sets in the mediolateral, rostrocaudal and dorsoventral directions. However, calculation of their overlap indicated that only one half of their total volume was shared by both subpopulations. Further work is necessary to design and implement statistical tests that will be applicable to three-dimensional data and allow us to confirm our visual conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Possible Physiological Bases</title><p>Both the rostrocaudal distribution and three-dimensional organization of Fos immunoreactivity showed that activated neurons in the NTS were located in the vicinity of the AP, a finding consistent with the viscerotropic organization previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Norgren1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The segregation between subpopulations of NTS neurons following peptone and sucrose gavage might result from anatomical differences in the gastrointestinal sites of signaling, thus having anatomical rather than functional origins. Moreover, the signaling sites of peptone and sucrose in the intestine are not known sufficiently accurately to suggest a correlation with the observed segregation in the NTS. Considering the greater ability of protein, rather than carbohydrate, to delay gastric emptying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Bowen1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008974-Morens1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> one might propose that the observed differences in Fos-positive neuron positions were due to differences in gastrointestinal and absorptive kinetics. Indeed, these alterations certainly modulate the contributions of the signaling sites involved in gut-brain communication during digestion. Independently of the actual origin of these changes, it is clear that with respect to the greater potency of protein than carbohydrate in triggering control of ingestion, and considering the fact that the NTS is the key region in the satiation process, it is legitimate to hypothesize that the segregation of neuronal positions within the NTS reflects central satiation mapping.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusion and Perspectives</title><p>We have thus shown that different macronutrients activate distinct subpopulations of NTS neurons. Because of its complexity, this segregation could only be unmasked using a statistical, three-dimensional approach. Its physiological meaning still requires further investigation, but it is likely to be relevant to understanding how the brain traduces different metabolic situations and their influence on the control of food intake.</p><p>The currently proposed conceptual framework of eating behavior studies states that a small subset of brain regions integrates internal and external sensory cues and generates hunger, satiety and satiation. How these brain areas integrate feeding-related information remains largely unknown, mostly because these signals are multiple and signal continuously to the brain. Instead of focusing separately on each factor and its signaling to the brain (e.g., gastric volume or CCK), the method developed here is designed to gain insight into the neurobiology of eating using an integrated approach that focuses on a central representation of a complex internal situation rather than fine, but reduced, action/reaction effects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008974.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Three-dimensional models of the brainstem and Fos-expressing neurons.
