We previously reported survivin cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio (CNR) as an independent prognostic indicator in breast cancer. Here, we validate survivin CNR in a separate and extended cohort. Furthermore, we present new data suggesting that a low CNR may predict outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Survin expression was assessed using immunhistochemistry on a breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA) containing 512 tumours. Whole slide digital images were captured using an Aperio XT scanner. Automated image analysis was used to identify tumour from stroma and then to quantify tumour-specific nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin. A decision tree model selected using a 10-fold cross-validation approach was used to identify prognostic subgroups based on nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Following optimisation of the staining procedure, it was possible to evaluate survivin protein expression in 70.1% (n = 359) of the 512 tumours represented on the TMA. Decision tree analysis predicted that nuclear, as opposed to cytoplasmic, survivin was the most important determinant of overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). The decision tree model confirmed CNR of 5 as the optimum threshold for survival analysis. Univariate analysis demonstrated an association between a high CNR (&#x0003e;5) and a prolonged BCSS (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29-0.81, p = 0.006). Multivariate analysis revealed a high CNR (&#x0003e;5) was an independent predictor of BCSS (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27-0.82, p = 0.008). An increased CNR was associated with ER positive (p = 0.045), low grade (p = 0.007), Ki-67 (p = 0.001) and Her2 (p = 0.026) negative tumours. Finally, a high CNR was an independent predictor of OS in tamoxifen-treated ER-positive patients (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23-0.87, p = 0.018).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using the same threshold as our previous study, we have validated survivin CNR as a marker of good prognosis in breast cancer in a large independent cohort. These findings provide robust evidence of the importance of survivin CNR as a breast cancer biomarker, and its potential to predict outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Personalised medicine, whereby individuals receive tailored therapeutic regimens based on individual patient and tumour characteristics, is now felt to be an achievable goal. Effective implementation of personalised cancer therapeutic regimes, however, depends upon the successful identification and translation of informative biomarkers to aid clinical decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The role of immunohistochemistry (IHC) within this arena is most likely to involve predictive biomarker development, as highlighted by the classical success of both estrogen receptor (ER) and Her2 in breast cancer, which predict response to tamoxifen and trastuzumab, respectively.</p><p>Survivin (encoded by the gene, BIRC5), a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, is a multifunctional protein implicated in a number of cellular processes including apoptosis, mitosis and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Survivin has been proposed as a promising tumour biomarker mainly due to work using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), which revealed that survivin was the fourth most highly expressed transcript in a number of common cancers, but was rarely present in normal terminally-differentiated tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Multiple studies in several different tumour types have investigated the prognostic value of survivin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; however, many IHC-based studies have been hampered by a failure to reach a consensus regarding how survivin staining should be interpreted. Principally, discordance has focused on whether examination of the cytoplasmic fraction, nuclear fraction or both provide more useful information. Using IHC or subcellular fractionation, two pools of survivin have been located (nuclear and cytoplasmic). These different pools are immunochemically and functionally different and are independently modulated during cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Although it exhibits a high degree of tumour-specific expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and is one of the 16 cancer-related genes represented in the Oncotype DX assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the role of survivin as a breast cancer biomarker has remained the subject of much debate (1). Previous studies of survivin expression measured using qRT-PCR or IHC in primary breast cancer have reported that it is either prognostically irrelevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], or associated with improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or adverse outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Such discordant results could perhaps be explained by the fact that these studies did not account for subcellular localisation of survivin. Survivin is often simultaneously expressed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, making manual analysis of IHC difficult; however, the introduction of digital imaging devices and computer-assisted image analysis has provided a major advance towards quantitative description of IHC signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>We previously applied automated quantitative algorithms to analyse survivin IHC data and demonstrated that increased expression of nuclear, as opposed to cytoplasmic, survivin was associated with a decreased overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A high cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio (CNR) was associated with low grade, hormone receptor positivity and improved OS and BCSS. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a high CNR (&#x0003e;5) was an independent predictor of a prolonged survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>This was the first study to examine the relationship between survivin CNR and outcome and is consistent with the hypothesis that nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin fractions have different biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These earlier findings suggested that nuclear survivin is a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer and that automated analysis can be used to quantify nuclear survivin. However, given the large number of conflicting studies previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], a validation study is required. The aim of the current study was to use advanced pattern recognition algorithms to validate survivin CNR as a prognostic biomarker in an independent breast cancer dataset.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>This study included 512 consecutive patients with primary invasive breast cancer treated and diagnosed at Malm&#x000f6; University Hospital between 1<sup>st </sup>January 1988 and 31<sup>st </sup>December 1992 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The median age at diagnosis was 65 (range 27-96) years and median follow-up time to first breast cancer event was 128 months (0-207). Information regarding the date of death was obtained from the regional cause-of-death registries for all patients. Complete treatment data were available for 379 (76%) patients, 160 of whom had received adjuvant tamoxifen. Twenty-three patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Two hundred patients received no adjuvant systemic treatment. Ethical permission was obtained from the Local Ethics Committee at Lund University (Dnr 613/02), whereby informed consent was deemed not to be required other than by the opt-out method.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue microarray construction</title><p>TMAs were constructed using two 0.6 mm cores taken from areas representative of invasive cancer and mounted in a recipient block using a manual arraying device (MTA-1, Beecher Inc, WI, USA) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. TMA blocks were stored in Dept. of Pathology in Malm&#x000f6; University Hospital, Sweden. TMA sections were cut immediately prior to staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Sections (4 &#x003bc;m) were dried, deparaffinised and rehydrated through descending concentrations of ethanol. Heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed using microwave treatment for 2 &#x000d7; 5 min in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0), before being processed either in the Ventana Benchmark system (Ventana Medical Systems Inc, AZ) using pre-diluted antibodies to ER (Anti-ER, clone 6F11), progesterone receptor (PR) (Anti-PgR, clone 16) and Her2 (Pathway CB-USA, 760-2694) or in the Dako Techmate 500 system (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for Ki-67 (1:200, M7240; Dako) and survivin (1:50, D-8 Santa Cruz, CA). ER, PR and Ki-67 were quantified using a commercially available automated nuclear algorithm (<italic>IHC-MARK</italic>; OncoMark Limited, Ireland), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. ER, PR and Ki-67 negativity was defined as &#x0003c; 10% positively stained nuclei. Her2 staining was evaluated according to a standard protocol (HercepTest) and scored as 4 intensities (i.e. negative, weak, moderate and strong), namely 0-3+; these scores were divided into two groups, with negative to weak (0-2+) Her2 expression (Her2<sup>-</sup>) and strong (3+) overexpression (Her2<sup>+</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Image acquisition, management and analysis</title><p>The Aperio ScanScope XT Slide Scanner (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA) system was used to capture whole slide digital images with a 20&#x000d7; objective. Digital images were managed using Spectrum (Aperio). Tumour and stromal elements were identified using Genie (Aperio) pattern recognition software and a quantitative scoring model for both nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin was developed using the positive pixel count algorithm (Aperio).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Spearman's Rho correlation was used to estimate the relationship between duplicate cores from individual tumours. Differences in distribution of clinical data and tumour characteristics between samples with a high and low survivin nuclear autoscore (SNAS) and CNR were evaluated using the &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>test. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log rank test were used to illustrate differences between OS and BCSS according to survivin expression. Cox regression proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relationship to OS and BCSS of survivin, patient age, lymph node status, tumour grade, Her2, PR, and ER status in the patient cohort. For decision tree analysis, all patients were randomly divided into 10 subsets. A decision tree model was selected using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. Ten consecutive decision tree models were independently constructed using the SNAS and CNR continuous output from 9 subsets. Prognostic accuracy of each decision tree model was tested using the remaining set of patients, with the model displaying the highest accuracy being selected as the optimal model for the dataset. All calculations were performed using SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Automated quantification of survivin protein expression in breast cancer</title><p>The specificity of the anti-survivin antibody was confirmed in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

This algorithm was trained using five prospectively selected patterns - 1) tumour positive, 2) tumour negative, 3) stromal fibroblast and extracellular matrix, 4) lymphocytes and 5) slide background (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Following manual annotation of the training set, the five patterns were provided as an input for the pattern recognition algorithm in order to select the optimum approach. Performance of the pattern recognition algorithm was then tested in 20 randomly selected tissue cores (validation set). Comparison of automated quantification to manual annotation at pixel level resolution within the validation set revealed that the automated approach had an accuracy of 87.3%.

A pseudo-colour "mark-up" image was generated for each core as the algorithm output (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The accuracy of the algorithm was examined in high power fields (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and was deemed acceptable by a histopathologist.</p><p>The algorithm was used to calculate total survivin intensity, as well as cytoplasmic and nuclear intensity for each core. One of the issues to consider when examining staining intensity alone is that even a small fraction of staining artifact can significantly alter intensity values. Therefore, to reduce noise secondary to staining artifact SNAS (which combines the product of percentage positive nuclei and nuclear intensity) was proposed as an alternative automated scoring model for evaluating nuclear survivin expression. A combined percentage and intensity autoscore was calculated for both nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin expression, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A strong correlation was evident between duplicate cores from individual tumours for nuclear percentage (Spearman's Rho = 0.350; p &#x0003c; 0.001), nuclear intensity (Spearman's Rho = 0.479; p &#x0003c; 0.001), cytoplasmic percentage (Spearman's Rho = 0.620; p &#x0003c; 0.001) and cytoplasmic intensity (Spearman's Rho = 0.619; p &#x0003c; 0.001), indicating a homogeneous pattern of expression. As tumours were arrayed in duplicate, the maximum value for each tumour was used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear, as opposed to cytoplasmic, survivin correlates with outcome in breast cancer</title><p>We previously described a relationship between the CNR of survivin and patient outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]; however, the relationship between nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin expression within individual tumours was not investigated. Comparison of nuclear and cytoplasmic autoscores from individual tumours revealed a good correlation between maximum nuclear and cytoplasmic autoscore (Spearman's Rho = 0.753; p &#x0003c; 0.001), suggesting that nuclear and cytoplasmic expression co-exist. In an attempt to further evaluate the relationship between nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin expression, patients were divided into groups based on SNAS centiles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This revealed a close relationship between nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin. When nuclear survivin was low, cytoplasmic survivin was also low; likewise, when nuclear survivin was high, cytoplasmic survivin was also high. However, a divergence between the two measures in the mid range values suggests that a ratio such as the CNR may be useful.</p><p>Decision tree analysis was then used to examine the prognostic role of nuclear and cytoplamic survivin expression. Using a 10-fold cross-validation approach, the normalised importance of SNAS, survivin cytoplasmic autoscore and CNR was computed in relation to BCSS and OS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). SNAS was consistently the most prognostic marker for OS and BCSS followed by CNR, again suggesting an important prognostic role for nuclear survivin.</p></sec><sec><title>Survivin nuclear autoscore is an independent predictor of outcome</title><p>In our initial study, we reported no link between survivin nuclear or cytoplasmic intensity and survival; however, an increased SNAS was associated with a reduced BCSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

However, univariate cox regression analysis of SNAS as a continuous variable revealed an association between SNAS and a decreased BCSS (HR 1.028, 95% CI 1.001-1.056; p = 0.044). A decision tree model was thus employed to identify the optimal threshold for SNAS in this cohort (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and predicted 4.26 as an optimal cut-off for automated SNAS (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Survivin CNR and SNAS correlate with patient outcome</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Schematic view of the decision tree prognostic classification model based on the continuous automated quantification of SNAS.

Decision tree models were again used to identify an optimal threshold for CNR.

There was an excellent correlation between low CNR and high CNR defined using a threshold of 4.87 or 5 (R = 0.983, p &#x0003c; 0.001).

The potential now exists to gather increasingly complex biomedical and molecular data to develop personalised therapeutic regimens. Personalised medicine requires the discovery and application of unambiguous prognostic, predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to inform therapeutic decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. One of the disappointing aspects of the post-genomic era is that while a plethora of putative biomarkers have undergone preliminary clinical evaluations, only a small minority have received regulatory approval for clinical use. This attrition rate has been attributed to the lack of validation studies. Here, we describe the validation of survivin CNR in a large consecutive breast cancer cohort.</p><p>Using automated image analysis and decision tree analysis, we demonstrated that nuclear, as opposed to cytoplasmic, survivin is a major predictor of outcome in breast cancer. Increased SNAS was associated with a reduced BCSS and OS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), while an increased CNR was associated with an improved BCSS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), confirming the relationship between nuclear survivin and poor outcome. Multivariate analysis confirmed that both measures were independent predictors of outcome (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), thus validating our previous findings associating nuclear survivin with a poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although the threshold used to dichotomise patients based on high versus low SNAS (4.26) was different to our initial study, decision tree analysis confirmed a threshold of 5 for CNR in this study also, thus validating our initial analysis in a second cohort using an identical threshold for survival analysis. High CNR was also associated with a number of good prognostic features including ER positivity and low grade (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Conversely, a high SNAS was associated with high grade, Ki-67 positive tumours (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), suggesting that nuclear survivin is associated with a proliferative phenotype.</p><p>These data further validate the hypothesis that the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of survivin have different biological roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and support an important role for nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of survivin in tumourigenesis and disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of survivin is controlled by an evolutionary conserved Crm1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES). A number of groups have demonstrated that inhibition of this signal abrogates the anti-apoptotic effect of survivin, while maintaining its mitotic effect activity, suggesting that increased levels of nuclear survivin could lead to a proliferative aggressive phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>As mentioned previously, the prognostic relevance of survivin in breast cancer is a controversial issue and a number of smaller qualitative IHC-based studies have produced conflicting results. It is possible that the quantitative measurement of survivin (either by ELISA or image analysis) is necessary for its utilisation as a breast cancer biomarker. Interestingly, our initial study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], as well as those of Span <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and Ryan <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], used quantitative methods to evaluate survivin expression and found similar results. The added benefit of our approach is that formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials, as opposed to frozen tissue specimens, can be used.</p><p>In this study, we were also able to perform subset analysis and demonstrate that a low CNR predicts poor outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). A number of groups have demonstrated that survivin is associated with tamoxifen resistance <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Span <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] reported that increased levels of survivin expression (quantified using ELISA) were associated with a good response to chemotherapy, but a poor response to endocrine therapy. We were unable to examine response to chemotherapy in this study, as only 23 patients received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Here, survivin expression was examined in 89 tamoxifen-treated patients, which compares adequately with Span <italic>et al </italic>who examined survivin expression in 73 patients treated with tamoxifen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and adds further evidence that survivin may play an important role in anti-endocrine resistance. It should be acknowledged that these patients did not participate in a prospective randomised trial, and the predictive value of survivin CNR in tamoxifen-treated patients should be validated in such a setting.</p><p>These data add further evidence to the theory that inhibition of survivin may be a viable therapeutic option. A number of phase I and II trials evaluating small molecule inhibitors, antisense nucleotides and immunotherapy targeted against survivin are ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our data suggest that inhibition of nuclear, as opposed to cytoplasmic, survivin will render the best results, and that the combination of anti-survivin therapies and tamoxifen may be an attractive therapeutic option in a subgroup of ER-positive patients. Further studies will be required to shed light on the value of nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin expression as a surrogate markers of response to any new treatment, with the image analysis solution presented here potentially providing important information in this regard.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have validated our previously published method of quantitatively determining the expression of survivin via IHC. Our data add further evidence to the hypothesis that the different sub-cellular pools of survivin have distinct functions and increased levels of nuclear survivin are associated with a proliferative phenotype. Additionally, we have demonstrated that nuclear survivin may predict outcome for tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients. However, this will require further validation in a prospective cohort. The quantitative image analysis approach described here may be helpful in further dissecting the debate surrounding the role of survivin IHC as a prognostic marker in breast cancer and may be particularly beneficial if ongoing trials of anti-survivin therapies are successful.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BCSS: breast cancer specific survival; CI: confidence interval; CNR: Cytoplasmic-to-Nuclear ratio; ER: estrogen receptor; HR: hazard ratio; IHC: immunohistochemistry; NES: nuclear export signal; OS: overall survival; PR: progesterone receptor; qRT-PCR: quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction; SAGE: serial analysis of gene expression; SNAS: Survivin Nuclear Autoscore</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>W.
