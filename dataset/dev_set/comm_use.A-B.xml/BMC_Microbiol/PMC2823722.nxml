The bacterium exhibits broad host range and has been shown to cause disease in cattle, pigs, goats, horses, dolphins, koalas, kangaroos, deers, cats, dogs and gorillas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Acquisition of the bacterium could be through inhalation of aerosol, ingestion of contaminated water and inoculation through open skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In humans, the disease could present with varied manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection, localized disease such as pneumonia or organ abscesses to systemic disease with septicemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The disease could be acute or chronic, and relapse from latency is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The versatility of <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>as a pathogen is reflected in its huge 7.24 Mb genome organized into two chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. One of the most important virulence factors that has been partially characterized in <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>is its Type Three Secretion Systems (T3SS), of which it has three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Each T3SS typically consists of a cluster of about 20 genes encoding structural components, chaperones and effectors which assemble into an apparatus resembling a molecular syringe that is inserted into host cell membrane for the delivery of bacterial effectors into host cell cytosol. One of the <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>T3SS known as Bsa or T3SS3 resembles the <italic>inv/mxi/spa </italic>T3SS of <italic>Salmonella </italic>and <italic>Shigella</italic>, and has been shown to be important for disease in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The other two T3SS (T3SS1 and 2) resemble the T3SS of plant pathogen <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and do not contribute to virulence in mammalian models of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Being a soil saprophyte and having the plant pathogen-like T3SS raise the possibility that <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>could also be a plant pathogen. As <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>is a risk group 3 agent with specific requirements for containment, we first test this hypothesis using the closely related species <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>as a surrogate model especially in experiments where risk of aerosolization is high, before we verify key experiments with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>. <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>is considered largely avirulent in mammalian hosts unless given in very high doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We infected both tomato as well as rice plants with <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>to determine their susceptibility to disease. Furthermore, the role of the three <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>T3SS in causing plant disease is evaluated and the implication of the ability of <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>to infect plants is discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions</title><p>All bacterial strains, plasmids used and constructed are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

We first examined these mutants in the established macrophage cytotoxicity model and confirmed the necessity of T3SS3 in mediating cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] whereas mutants losing T3SS1 and T3SS2 were as cytotoxic as wildtype bacteria to THP-1 cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This shows that T3SS1 and T3SS2 are not involved in mediating cytoxicity to mammalian cells. To exclude the possibility that any defect we see with the T3SS mutants would be due to a reduced fitness, we ascertained that all mutants grew as well as wildtype bacteria in LB and plant MS medium (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B-C</xref>). However, infection of tomato plantlets via unwounded roots showed that plants infected by the T3SS1 and T3SS2 mutants exhibited significant delay in disease compared to plants infected by wildtype bacteria (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Statistical analysis of the average disease score over 7 days showed that the T3SS1, 2 and 3 mutants were significantly less virulent from the wildtype bacteria (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). T3SS1 and T3SS2 mutants were also significantly less virulent compared to the T3SS3 mutant (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). This shows that both T3SS1 and T3SS2 contribute significantly to pathogen virulence towards tomato plants. The T3SS3 mutant also showed an intermediate degree of virulence between wildtype bacteria and the T3SS1 and T3SS2 mutants, likely because T3SS3 has a non-redundant role in mediating virulence in the susceptible tomato plants.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The role of T3SS in plant infection</bold>.

When bacteria were inoculated directly into the leaf blade, no bacteria were recoverable from the leaf one day after inoculation, indicating a lack of establishment of infection. The inoculated leaves did not show any yellowing (data not shown) as seen in the tomato leaves. Thus, rice plants are non-hosts to the bacteria.

Subsequently, many strains from various <italic>B. cepacia </italic>complex were shown to be able to cause disease in the alfalfa infection model as well as in the rat agar bead model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In this study, we show that <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>and <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>are also potential plant pathogens. They are capable of infecting susceptible plants such as tomato.</p><p>Plant pathogenic bacteria have been shown to express a large number of T3SS effectors capable of interfering with plant basal defense triggered by bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) as well as Resistance (R) protein-mediated immunity typically characterized by the Hypersensitive Response (HR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The outcome of the interaction with susceptible hosts for these successful pathogens would be disease. We found that the virulence of <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>in tomato is contributed significantly by T3SS1 and T3SS2, but to a much lesser extent by T3SS3. T3SS1 and T3SS2 are likely non-redundant to each other in causing disease because each mutant demonstrates significant attenuation, possibly because both T3SS1 and T3SS2 are co-ordinately involved in pathogenesis. This is the first time that a role has been defined for T3SS1 and T3SS2 in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, showing that they are functional and not simply vestiges of evolution. The role of T3SS3 could be due to its contribution of a structural component or chaperone to the other two T3SS or an effector which could also interfere with plant cell physiology albeit less efficiently than with mammalian cells. Nevertheless, our study shows the important role played by T3SS in <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>pathogenesis in tomato plants.</p><p>In contrast to tomato, we found that both <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>and <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>are non-adapted for rice. This is not surprising as <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>are routinely recovered from rice paddy fields in regions of endemicity such as Thailand and have never been reported to cause any disease in rice plants. It is possible that PAMPs from <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>and <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>are able to trigger an effective basal defence from rice to halt bacterial colonization, a common means of plant resistance against non-adapted microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Another intriguing possibility is that compounds secreted by rice plants may inhibit the growth of <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>and <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>. The presence of secondary metabolites induced by <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>infection in plants with differential susceptibility to disease could reveal novel anti-infective compounds against melioidosis to counter the problem of extensive antibiotic resistance in this bacterium.</p><p>Thus, <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>joins a growing list of human pathogens which have been found to be able to infect plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], the first of which to be described was <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The plant host model has been used to perform large scale screening of a library of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>mutants to identify novel virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] as some virulence factors encoded by genes such as <italic>toxA</italic>, <italic>plcS </italic>and <italic>gacA </italic>were shown to be important for bacterial pathogenesis in both plants and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Given the evidence that <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>T3SS3 may be capable of interacting with both mammalian and plant hosts, and the ability of <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>to infect tomato, one could develop susceptible plants as alternative host models for large scale screening of <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>mutants to aid in novel virulence factor discovery, similar to what had been done for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>Previously, <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>has been shown to infect <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and <italic>Acanthamoeba </italic>species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and <italic>C. elegans </italic>could be used as an alternative host model for large scale screening and identification of <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our current finding reveals the additional versatility of <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>as a pathogen and further research would likely uncover novel bacterial mechanisms capable of interacting with its varied hosts. Much more work is needed to define the susceptibility of various plant species to <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>to find a suitable plant host for virulence factor discovery. It remains to be seen if <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>is a natural pathogen for crops such as tomatoes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we identified <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>as a plant pathogen capable of causing disease in tomato but not rice plants. <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>T3SS1 and T3SS2 contribute significantly to disease whereas T3SS3 plays a more minor role. Although the significance of <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>as a natural plant pathogen in the environment is unknown, one could postulate that certain plants may serve as a reservoir for the bacteria. Since <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>is classified as a bioterrorism agent by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap">http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap</ext-link>, our findings indicate that it may be necessary to re-evaluate whether <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>poses threats beyond the animal kingdom and whether plant systems could be used as environmental indicators of the presence of the bacteria either as endemic residents or due to the intentional release by terrorists, a concept that has been previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YHL participated in the design of the study, carried out most experiments, analyzed and interpreted the data, and performed statistical analysis.
