Understanding the mechanisms by which cells move will ultimately require a detailed knowledge of the components that regulate the behaviour of force-generating cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin and myosin.</p><p>The life cycle of the social amoeba, <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, is dependent on directional cell movement. In the growth phase, amoebae are attracted to folate released from their bacterial prey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. When starved, amoebae establish a signal relay system based on cAMP that causes them to aggregate together into a multicellular structure. In both cases, two Ras proteins, RasG and RasC, have been shown to play central roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The localization of activated Ras to the front of the cell is one of the first responses to chemoattractant stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A recent study has shown that activation first occurs across the entire plasma membrane but progressively becomes more confined to the leading edge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, results from a detailed analysis of Ras activation in various <italic>rasGEF</italic> and <italic>rasGAP</italic> mutants support the idea that multiple Ras isoforms, such as RasG and RasC drive chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Vegetative cells lacking RasG exhibit a complex phenotype; reduced growth, reduced macropinocytosis, defects in cytokinesis, a disorganized cytoskeleton, reduced motility and reduced folate chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Removal of RasC likewise results in reduced folate chemotaxis, though the effect is somewhat milder compared to the loss of RasG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, when both RasG and RasC are removed in combination, the mutant cells exhibit identical phenotypes to those of <italic>rasG-</italic> cells, except that they are totally incapable of directional movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This suggests that RasG and RasC synergise to regulate folate chemotaxis but that RasG alone regulates cytoskeletal organization and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Downstream of Ras activation, three pathways have been identified that are activated with similar kinetics; PI3K, TORC2 and sGC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, cells lacking RasG and/or RasC exhibit reduced activation of PI3K and TORC2 pathways, presumably because effective signaling requires direct interaction between these proteins and active Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Surprisingly, however, none of these pathways are essential for chemotaxis to folate and instead serve only accessory roles in signal amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In fact, recent evidence suggests that PI3K signaling is required only for macropinocytosis, and can actively inhibit folate chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A more likely candidate connecting Ras activation to the chemotaxis apparatus is PiKI, which produces PIP2. Cells lacking this protein display normal Ras activation but fail to initiate Ras-dependent responses or orientate in cAMP gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, while the genetic analysis of mutants is complicated by apparent redundancy between isoforms and an incomplete knowledge of the branching downstream pathways, there is a general consensus that Ras plays a significant role in signaling during directional sensing and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This consensus view has, however, been challenged by a recent study that has shown <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> mutant cells are fully capable of folate chemotaxis, although different experimental conditions were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>One consequence of removing RasG alone or both RasG and RasC from cells is the up-regulation of RasD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], a protein whose expression is normally restricted to the developmental stages of the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. RasD and RasG share 83% identity and differ by only 3 amino acids in the N-terminal 106 residues of the protein, with no variation in effector switch I or switch II domains. It is clear that this up-regulation is insufficient to prevent the observed defective vegetative cell phenotypes of <italic>rasG- and rasG-/rasC-</italic> mutant cells<italic>.</italic> However, the addition of exogenous RasD expression rescues the growth and cytokinesis defects, but not the motility and folate chemotaxis defects of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In this study we have directly compared folate chemotaxis in <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells, using the original experimental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the conditions used in the more recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We have confirmed that RasG is important for optimal folate chemotaxis, and have then explored, using protein chimeras of RasG and RasD, which portions of the RasG molecule contribute to folate chemotaxis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Requirement of Ras signaling in folate chemotaxis in vegetative cells depends upon growth conditions</title><p>The recent observation indicating the absence of a role for Ras proteins in folate chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] is at odds with earlier observations that a <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> double knockout strain displayed zero chemotaxis towards a folate-filled micropipette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In order to try to reconcile these conflicting results, we tested whether methodological differences between the two studies affect the chemotactic accuracy of the <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells. One important difference was that the earlier studies used cells grown axenically (the term &#x0201c;axenic&#x0201d; is used to refer to cells that obtain nutrients from liquid medium, in the absence of bacteria), while the more recent study used cells grown on bacteria. Therefore, we directly compared the folate chemotaxis indices of cells cultured axenically and on bacteria.</p><p>Our results showed that the mean chemotaxis index of <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells was significantly increased by the shift from axenic to bacterial growth (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, mean diff. = 0.227, 95% CI [0.092, 0.362], p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.0001). This result is consistent with the recent conclusion that <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells are capable of positive chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We noted, however, that there was still a significant reduction in folate chemotaxis between JH10 cells and <italic>rasG</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup><italic>/rasC-</italic> cells grown on bacteria (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, mean diff. = -0.183, 95% CI [-0.066, -0.3], p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.001). Furthermore, there was negligible chemotaxis by <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells relative to control JH10 cells, when cells were grown axenically (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, mean diff. = -0.336, 95% CI [-0.219, -0.452], p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.00001), supporting the earlier conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Our data, therefore, indicate that Ras signaling is important for optimal chemotaxis to folate regardless of growth conditions, but that this requirement is diminished by growth on bacteria.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The effect of axenic vs. bacterial growth on folate chemotaxis.</bold> Light grey circles show the average chemotaxis index of individual control JH10 [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;80] and <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40], grown either in axenic medium or on bacteria.

The <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> genome encodes 11 <italic>ras</italic> genes. Of these, 5 (RasG, RasC, RasD, RasB, RasS) have been partially characterised, and all (except RasS) have been detected by specific antibodies during the growth phase and shown to have different mobilities on electrophoresis gels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Extremely low transcript levels argue that the remaining 6 <italic>ras</italic> gene products are unlikely to be detectable by Western Blot (DictyExpress). Therefore, the levels and identities of different Ras proteins can be identified using a non-specific Pan-Ras antibody.</p><p>Firstly, there was no evidence of any novel Ras isoform in the bacterially grown <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells when compared to their axenic counterparts (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This result suggests that any Ras-mediated improvements to folate chemotaxis would manifest as changes in the expression level of the Ras proteins already present in these cells.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Total Ras expression in axenic and bacterially grown cells.</bold> Levels determined with Pan-Ras antibody. The lower M<sub>r</sub> bands in the ras<italic>G-</italic> and ras<italic>G-rasC-</italic> lanes represents up-regulated RasD (arrow).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-15-13-2"/></fig><p>It has been shown previously that RasD expression is considerably enhanced when the <italic>rasG</italic> gene is deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and this enhanced expression is also detected by the Pan-Ras antibody. RasD levels were undetectable in the JH10 cells but clearly present in both <italic>rasG-</italic> and <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells grown axenically and on bacteria (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In addition, bacterial growth of these cells was correlated with qualitative increases in RasD levels. This increase cannot explain the improvement in folate chemotaxis of <italic>rasG</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup><italic>/rasC</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup> cells observed by a switch from axenic to bacterial growth, since exogenous RasD expression does not rescue the chemotactic defects of <italic>rasG</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup><italic>/rasC</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Surprisingly, there was a comparative decrease in RasG levels in JH10 cells grown on bacteria. This clearly has no impact on folate chemotaxis, since their folate chemotactic indexes are not significantly different (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and may instead be related to the significant differences in growth rates between the bacterially and axenically grown cells.</p><p>Finally, it is also unlikely that there are increased levels of active Ras in bacterially grown <italic>rasG</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup><italic>/rasC</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup> cells, because membrane recruitment of RBD-GFP remains low in cells stimulated with folate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, there is no evidence that the improved chemotactic accuracy of bacterially grown <italic>rasG</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup><italic>/rasC</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup> cells involves novel Ras signaling pathways or the modulation of currently existing ones.</p></sec><sec><title>Initial distance from micropipette affects folate chemotaxis of bacterially grown <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells</title><p>There is an additional difference in the folate chemotaxis measurements between the earlier and more recent studies. In the more recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], folate chemotaxis was measured in a field of cells that appeared to be at considerably higher cell density than was used for the earlier measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and consequently the chemotactic index was measured only for cells close to the tip. Chemoattractant gradients decrease exponentially at increasing distances from the tip such that cells close to the tip experience high concentrations and steep gradients of folate, whereas those further away experience lower concentrations and shallower gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This has been shown to influence chemotactic measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We therefore controlled for the cell density of the <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells and looked at the effect of distance from the micropipette at T<sub>0</sub> on the determination of the folate chemotaxis index. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, individual <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells grown on bacteria displayed positive chemotaxis below an initial distance of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m (average chemotactic index of 0.33), but negligible levels of chemotaxis (average chemotactic index of 0.08) above a distance of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. Over the same distance range, JH10 cells grown on bacteria exhibited no variation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Thus, initial distance of the cell from the micropipette is an important factor determining whether or not bacterially grown <italic>rasG</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup><italic>/rasC</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup> cells will exhibit directional movement. In contrast, <italic>rasG</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup><italic>/rasC</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup> cells grown axenically displayed negligible chemotaxis at all distances from the micropipette (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), confirming previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This result reinforces the idea that Ras signaling is crucial for folate chemotaxis of axenically grown cells. Furthermore, we show that Ras signaling is not absolutely essential for the chemotaxis of bacterially grown cells, but that its role becomes increasingly important at either lower concentrations or shallower gradients of folate.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The effect of distance on folate chemotaxis of bacterially grown </bold><bold><italic>rasG-/rasC- </italic></bold><bold>cells.</bold> Chemotaxis index values plotted against distance from micropipette at T<sub>0</sub>.

There have been several reports detailing morphological, metabolic and transcriptional differences between axenically and bacterially grown cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. There are also effects on cell motility. First, bacterially grown cells move faster than axenic cells in random motility assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Indeed, our own measurements show that bacterially grown JH10 and <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells migrate at higher velocities than their axenically grown counterparts during folate chemotaxis (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1). Second, a recent study has shown that transfer of the background strain AX2 from axenic to bacterial growth improves chemotaxis in linear folate gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the same paper, PIP<sub>3</sub>-dependent macropinocytosis, the predominant mode of feeding in amoebae grown axenically, was identified as an inhibitor of chemotaxis. We did not observe a significant difference between the chemotactic indices of JH10 cells grown in axenic medium or on bacteria (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), possibly owing to strain-specific differences. However, there was a clear difference between folate chemotaxis of axenic and bacterially grown <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Whilst axenically grown <italic>rasG</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup><italic>/rasC</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup> cells exhibit reduced macropinocytosis (unpublished observations), there may still be sufficient activity to severely inhibit folate chemotaxis.</p><p>Although the effect of macropinocytosis inhibition may explain some of our observations, it does not explain why ras<italic>G-/rasC-</italic> cells exhibit reduced chemotaxis regardless of their growth condition. One possibility is that axenically grown cells are relatively unpolarized, and only become polarized when exposed to folate gradients (R. Insall, personal communication). Ras signaling is important for initiating and reinforcing decisions to polarize the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and axenically grown <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells may be less capable of amplifying signals sufficiently to be able to orient towards the chemotactic signal. In contrast, Ras-dependent amplification of the chemotactic signal in a strong folate gradient is important for optimal chemotaxis of bacterially grown <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells, but not essential. Interestingly, Ras signaling is still of prime importance for the bacterially grown <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells in shallow folate gradients.</p></sec><sec><title>Specificity of the RasG requirement for optimum chemotaxis</title><p>We showed previously that exogenous expression of RasD was incapable of restoring folate chemotaxis in <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To understand what makes RasG uniquely required for chemotaxis, we decided to generate chimeras of RasG and RasD that would assess the relative importance of the 3 amino acids in the N-terminal portion of the RasG protein and the differences in residues in the C-terminal half of the protein. For this, a PCR-based approach was used in which primers were designed to generate a product that would leave an overhanging end containing sequence to which a corresponding product could ligate. The product, designated RasD1G2, corresponds to the N-terminal 104 residues of RasD ligated to the C-terminal 86 residues of RasG. The product, designated RasG1D2, corresponds to the N-terminal 104 residues of RasG ligated to the C-terminal 84 residues of RasD (Note: the total sequence lengths are not the same because RasG contains two additional amino acids). Each of these products was cloned into an exogenous expression vector downstream of the <italic>rasG</italic> promoter and transformed into <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells. Intact RasD and RasG were also transformed so that there was an experimental baseline to which our chimera data could be compared. G418-resistant clones were isolated and subjected to Western blotting with specific RasD or RasG antibodies to confirm that all the proteins were expressed at similar levels (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Both N- and C- terminal halves of RasG are required for optimal folate chemotaxis of axenically grown cells.

The expression of either the RasD1G2 or RasG1D2 constructs in <italic>rasG-/rasC-</italic> cells significantly improves folate chemotaxis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). However, a statistical comparison between JH10 cells and RasD1G2 and RasG1D2 expressing cells reveals that chemotaxis is fully restored only by RasG1D2 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B, mean diff. = 0.023, 95% CI [-0.105, 0.151], p = &#x0003e;0.05), and not RasD1G2 proteins (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B, mean diff. = 0.155, 95% CI [-0.027, 0.283], p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.05). This result suggests 1) that both the 3 altered amino acids in the N-terminal portion and the entire C-terminal portion make important contributions to RasG-mediated chemotaxis and 2) the N-terminal portion is perhaps more important for this function than the C-terminal portion. Likewise, an earlier study found that both the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the RasC molecule were important for adenylate cyclase activation during the aggregation of starving cells towards the chemoattractant, cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It was suggested that both the interaction of RasC with a specific downstream effector through the N-terminal portion of the molecule and the subcellular membrane localization through its C-terminal portion were important for function. Similar conclusions may be reached regarding the specificity of RasG for folate chemotaxis in vegetative cells. However, it is important to note that the differences between N-terminal portions of RasG and RasD number only 3 amino acids. Moreover, each of these differences is conservative (Ser&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;Thr, Asp&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;Glu, Tyr&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;Phe), and located at positions outside of the normal switch I and switch II interaction surfaces.</p><p>Understanding the functional specificity of different Ras isoforms is a hurdle that must be overcome to develop efficacious inhibitors of Ras signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Protein chimeras composed of subfamily isoforms can be used to explore portions of protein molecules that are important for specific functions. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> RasD and RasG are highly homologous to human Ras proteins (64% and 67% compared to H-Ras; 65% and 70% compared to K-Ras). Therefore, an insight into what makes RasG and RasD functionally distinct from each other may open up new avenues of inquiry in higher organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>RasG is required for optimal chemotaxis, regardless of growth condition. Increased initial distance from the chemoattractant source is correlated with reduced chemotactic accuracy, suggesting that RasG is particularly important for directional cell migration in weak gradients. In strong gradients, the requirement for RasG is relaxed, but only in bacterially grown cells. The role of RasG in folate chemotaxis is unique, and cannot be replaced by the 83% identical, RasD molecule. Both N- and C- terminal portions of the RasG protein contribute to folate chemotaxis, suggesting that there are functionally important amino acids outside the well established switch I and switch II interaction surfaces.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and maintenance</title><p>For axenic growth, all strains were cultured in HL-5 medium (per litre: 15.4&#x000a0;g glucose, 14.3&#x000a0;g bactopeptone, 7.15&#x000a0;g yeast extract, 0.96&#x000a0;g Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.49&#x000a0;g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) containing 50&#x000a0;mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma, USA) and 50&#x000a0;mg/ml ampicilin (Sigma, USA).

Preparation of cells grown under different conditions for experimentation was as follows: Axenic cells were washed from sub-confluent tissue cultures plates (Nunc, Rochester NY) containing HL-5. Bacterially grown cells were harvested into HL-5 from clearing plates and the remaining bacteria removed by 3&#x000d7; 5&#x000a0;min centrifugation steps at 1000&#x000a0;rpm.
