Background</title><p>Gastrointestinal Injuries are one of the complications during gynecological operation
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R1">1</xref>). Small intestine and colon injuries can be
seen during gynecological procedures from dilatation and curettage (D&#x00026;C) to total
abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and laparoscopic or hysteroscopic procedures. Colon injuries
can occur in patients with left adnexal mass and women with a history of pelvic inflammatory
disease or diverticulitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R2">2</xref>). The common places
of injury are the large bowel, small bowel, rectum and rarely the gastric region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R4">4</xref>).
The incidence of bowel injuries is different based on the type of operation, ranging from
0.62 - 1.6 per 1000 laparoscopic surgeries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R5">5</xref>),
to 0.3% in hysterectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R6">6</xref>), 0.08% in cesarean
section (C/S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R7">7</xref>) and 0.04% in normal vaginal
delivery (NV/D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R8">8</xref>). Also, overall incidence of
bowel injuries is between 0.54% - 0.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R10">10</xref>). Approximately one-third of bowel injuries may
be diagnosed during the operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R10">10</xref>).
Mild injuries to the small and large bowel can be repaired by intestinal closure but
extensive injuries need a resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R11">11</xref>).</p><p>Based on our knowledge, there are a few published researches on the incidence of
gastrointestinal injuries during gynecologic operation. In one study on 128 bowel injuries,
the rate of injuries during "opening of the peritoneal cavity", "adhenolysis and pelvic
dissection", "laparoscopy", "vaginal operations" and "dilatation and curettage" was 37.5%,
35.2%, 10.2%, 8.6%, and 8.6%, respectively. Seventy-five percent of all injuries were to the
small bowel and 25% were to the large bowel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R10">10</xref>). Also, in another study, the rate of bowel injuries was similar to previous
research and in this research all injuries were repaired by intestinal closure, resection of
small bowel or colostomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R9">9</xref>). Proper management
of injuries during obstetric and gynecologic operation is very important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R11">11</xref>) and all gynecologists must be aware of such
injuries to decrease patient morbidity and prevent mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec22887"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>Considering the importance of this issue and lack of published data in Iran, this study was
performed to determine the causes and management of iatrogenic gastrointestinal injuries
during gynecological and obstetrical operation over a period of 12 years in Shabihkhani
Maternity Hospital in Kashan, Iran.</p></sec><sec id="sec22888"><title>3. Materials and Methods</title><p>In this descriptive retrospective study, performed from 1999 - 2011, all iatrogenic
gastrointestinal traumas (n=25) during gynecological and obstetrical operations in
Shabihkhani Maternity Hospital in Kashan city were studied. Shabihkhani Maternity Hospital
is an educational hospital for training of obstetric and gynecologic residents. Demographic
data such as age, gravid, parity, type of surgery or procedure, history of laparotomy, the
surgical operation, injury site, time of diagnosis and method of treatment were extracted
from the medical records. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.</p></sec><sec id="sec22889"><title>4. Results</title><p>Over a period of 12 years, there were 25 cases of gastrointestinal injuries during
gynecological and obstetrical operations. The mean age of women was 33.2 &#x000b1; 7.57 years,
the mean number of gravid was 2.44 &#x000b1; 1.2 and the mean number of parity was 1.8 &#x000b1;
1.2. In total 44% of patient had a history of cesarean section and 64% of them had a history
of vaginal delivery. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6252">Table 1</xref> shows that 44% of
patients had a history of abdominal scar. In 36% of cases the cause of injury was the fault
of a resident of obstetrics and gynecology. Thirty-two percent of all gastrointestinal
injuries occurred during total abdominal hysterectomy. The small bowel was injured in 36% of
the cases. </p><table-wrap id="tbl6252" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of the Frequency and Valid Percentage of Some Variables in Patients

injuries occurred during dilatation and curettage (44%). Also, most of the colon injuries
occurred during cesarean section and total abdominal hysterectomy (33%). Moreover, 100% of
cecum injuries were in patients who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy. Stomach injury
was seen only in one case who had undergone ovarian cystectomy. In onethird of the
surgeries, patients underwent laparotomy for peritonitis and stomach perforations were
diagnosed and repaired. In one patient the cause of injury to the intestine was
culdocentesis. During the operation, green discharge from the needle was observed that
indicated insertion to the intestine but there was no need to repair. This patient was
followed for one day and discharged from the hospital without any problems. Rectum injury
occurred during vaginal delivery in three patients. In two patients who underwent
laparoscopic surgery, small bowel and colon injury had similar rates (50%). In one case,
laparoscopy was done for adhenolysis and the patient had a history of ovarian cystectomy and
total abdominal hysterectomy. After diagnosis of colon injury, repair and colostomy was
performed.</p><p>Fifty-two percent of the injuries were diagnosed during the operation and the mean time of
injury diagnosis was 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.9 days (Ranging from 0 to 4 days). In one patient 10 days
after colostomy for cecum injury, recto vaginal fistula was found and repaired. Diagnosis of
injury during the operation was based on clinical findings and diagnosis of injury after the
operation was based on clinical symptoms such as pain, fever, ileus and diagnostic tests
such as ultrasonography, X-ray CT scan and laparotomy.</p><p>Injury treatment for 56% of patients was primary repair (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6252">Table 1</xref>). Repair of 44% of all injuries was performed by a general
surgeon. </p></sec><sec id="sec22890"><title>5. Discussion</title><p>Gastrointestinal injury incidental to obstetrical and gynecological operation is a rare
event and lack of published information makes it harder to compare and review the findings.
Our findings showed that 32% of all gastro intestinal injuries occurred in total abdominal
hysterectomy. The most common site that was injured in total abdominal hysterectomy was the
cecum (62.5%). Injuries during dilatation and curettage occurred in 20% of the cases. The
most common injury site in dilatation and curettage was the small bowel (80%). There was
only one gastric injury (4%) in this series that was seen in patients who had surgery for
ovarian cysts. Usually gastric injury can be caused during laparoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R13">13</xref>). The small bowel was injured in 36% of cases.
However in the study by kerb et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R10">10</xref>), this
rate was 75% while Bhatte et al found this rate to be 61.9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R10">10</xref>); these results
are different from our findings and this may be due to the type of surgery that involves
mainly the large intestine. Fourty-four percent of the patients had a history of previous
pelvic or abdominal surgery. In one study this rate was 64.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R9">9</xref>). Patients with a history of abdominal surgery scar are at high
risk for intestinal injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R13">13</xref>). This may be
due to intestinal adhesions following previous pelvic or abdominal surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R11">11</xref>). Suspicion of high-risk patients, exact
examination of all bowel and even intraoperative colonoscopy is recommended to prevent
injuries and for early recognition and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R14">14</xref>). In 36% of cases, the leading cause of injury was due to the surgical errors
of obstetrics and gynecology residents. In other studies, the surgical procedure was not
mentioned and therefore it is not possible to compare the findings in this field. However,
all of the obstetrics and gynecology residents must be trained in prevention and management
of these injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R9">9</xref>). Fifty-two percent of the
injuries were diagnosed during the operation and 48% were diagnosed after the surgery. In a
study on laparoscopic surgery, one-third of intestinal injuries were diagnosed during the
operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R5">5</xref>). This difference may be because we
reviewed all types of surgery but in the Sabharwal study, only injuries during laparoscopic
hysterectomy were assessed. Missed bowel injuries are more common in laparoscopic surgery,
where thermal injury to the bowel may not be obvious intra-operatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R15">15</xref>). In our study, 48% of injuries were diagnosed
in the postoperative period. Considering that only 8 percent of the procedures were
laparoscopic, this high percent of missed injuries is of concern. The mean diagnosis time of
the injury was 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.9 days (0 - 4 days). It was different from the Chapron et al
study on laparoscopic operation, in which the mean diagnosis time of the injury was 4.0
&#x000b1; 5.4 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R16">16</xref>).</p><p>Intra-operative detection of injuries is of great importance, since the delayed diagnosis
increases morbidity, and repair of the injury in an infected and inflamed abdomen may even
lead to placement of a colostomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R17">17</xref>).
Management of injury in 56% of patients was primarily by repair. In one study all injuries
were repaired by intestinal closure, resection of the small bowel or colostomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R9">9</xref>). Mild injuries to the small and large bowel can
be repaired by intestinal closure but extensive injuries need resections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A12088R11">11</xref>). Today, all of the gynecologic surgeons must be
trained in techniques to avoid and repair gastro intestinal injuries. Especially, when there
is a previous abdominal scar, they should be cautious to enter peritoneal or pelvic cavity.
As intra-operative colonoscopy is not available in many centers, the only way to decrease
iatrogenic injuries and prevent missed injuries is the exact examination of the abdomen,
gentle dissection of the tissues and high suspicion of high- risk patients with previous
abdominal operations. Laparoscopic procedures are becoming more and more prevalent and
special attention should be given to teach precise techniques and instrument utilization to
prevent occult iatrogenic injuries.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all of the participants who made this study possible.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="afn14376" fn-type="other"><p>
