Background</title><p>Fractures of the distal radius are encountered mainly in postmenopausal women, but may occur in any subject with osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10687R1">1</xref>). A variety of management options have been devised. Since the outcome of treatment appears to depend to a large extent, on bone density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10687R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10687R3">3</xref>), this factor should be taken into account when choosing the most suitable management strategy for each patient. However, distal radius fractures are very common and frequently occur when full imaging facilities are not available. As a result, the medical staff on duty will rarely be able to determine bone quality as a guide for treatment planning. In the absence of more sophisticated techniques, many physicians will look at standard radiographs and intuitively use the cortical thickness of the distal radius as a rough indicator of bone density. This approach was first described, for the femoral diaphysis, by Barnett and Nordin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10687R4">4</xref>). Similarly, the cortical thickness of the humerus has been used to estimate osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10687R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10687R6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec10863"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>The present study was performed with the objective of finding a simple approach for the assessment of bone density in the distal radius, for round-the-clock use by the emergency unit traumatologist or the operating surgeon. The technique was intended to be independent from more sophisticated facilities, and to provide approximate but reliable information.</p></sec><sec id="sec10864"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec10922"><title>3.1. Specimen Preparation</title><p>A total of 12 human cadaveric radii (6 pairs) were harvested from four female and two male donors. The mean donor age was 74 years (64 to 82). The specimens were obtained from voluntary human donors that had agreed to the use of their body for education and research after death and had died of illnesses other than bone diseases. The specimens were de-fleshed, vacuum-packed, and stored at &#x02013;22&#x000b0;C. Prior to testing, they were thawed at room temperature for 24 hours.</p></sec><sec id="sec10923"><title>3.2. BMD Determination in the Distal Radius</title><p>BMD in the distal radius was measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). All the BMD measurements were performed by the same investigator (A.P.). The thawed vacuum-packed specimens were placed in a basin filled with a semolina soft-tissue surrogate and positioned horizontally in a DXA machine (Hologic 4500A <sup>TM</sup>; Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA). Spine phantom scans were performed on a daily basis for quality control. The manufacturer's software was used for analysing the region of interest in the distal radius. The sites chosen were the ultra-distal radius (UD), the mid-distal radius (MID), and the one-third distal radius (1/3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2665">Figure 1</xref>). Each specimen was scanned twice, and the results were averaged. Correlations with the measured cortical thicknesses were calculated for the total BMD, for which the sum of the bone mineral contents (BMCs; g) of the areas was divided by the sum of the areas (cm<sup>2</sup>); and for the different subregions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2665">Figure 1</xref>.

Determination of Cortical Thickness</title><p>Two independent traumatologists determined the thickness of the distal-radius cortices (S.R. and K.K.). Measurements were performed on digitized radiographs, with the use of Ortho-Tool Cedara 1 Report 5.2 P14 software (Cedara Software Corporation, Milwaukee, WI, USA). First, the measuring site was determined: A line (marked A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2666">Figure 2</xref>) was drawn across the radiocarpal joint surface, from the styloid process to the distal radio-ulnar joint, and its length was obtained. Starting at the distal radio-ulnar joint, a line measuring the same length (marked A' in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2666">Figure 2</xref>) was then plotted in a proximal direction, along the medial border of the radial diaphysis. At the proximal end of this line, the outside diameter of the shaft (between the periosteal cortical borders &#x02013; marked B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2666">Figure 2</xref>) was measured at right angles to the axis of the diaphysis. The inside diameter of the shaft (between the endosteal cortical borders &#x02013; marked C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2666">Figure 2</xref>) was measured at the same site. The B/C ratio was obtained by dividing the outside diameter by the inside diameter.</p><fig id="fig2666" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Principle of Establishing the Cortical-Thickness Measuring Site</title><p>A, line across the radio-carpal joint surface; A', line of same length as A plotted along the radius in a proximal direction; B, line joining the outside (periosteal) borders of the cortical shell of the radius; C, line joining the inside (endosteal) borders of the cortical shell of the radius.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="atr-02-11-g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec10926"><title>3.5.

Discussion</title><p>Indirect radiological techniques such as DXA currently represent the gold standard for the assessment of bone density. However, they are rarely available to the traumatologists at the time of decision-making with regard to the management of the trauma case. This is why efforts are being made to provide the surgeon with direct means of quantifying bone density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10687R7">7-9</xref>). The outcome of the treatment of distal-radius fractures is greatly affected by the quality of the patient's bone stock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10687R2">2</xref>). However, these fractures are common, and treatment decisions should be taken as soon as possible after the traumatic event, which means that routine bone density assessment by the means of techniques such as DXA would be unrealistic. Unlike these more sophisticated methods, radiographs constitute the simplest, standardized and virtually always available diagnostic aid at the early stage of fracture management. The present study was not performed with a view to supersede such methods as DXA and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT); rather the object was to establish whether an intuitive look at the cortices of the distal radius would allow valid conclusions to be drawn as to the patient's forearm bone density. The results of our study suggest that distal-radius cortical thickness can indeed be used as a predictor of bone quality. Our findings agree with those of Tingart et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A10687R6">6</xref>), who reported an even stronger correlation between the cortical thickness of the proximal diaphysis of the humerus and the bone quality of the humeral head. The authors also used the metaphysis as the region of interest for BMD determination, with boundaries between sub-regions drawn according to anatomical landmarks of the individual humeri. Cortical thickness was measured at the level of the humeral diaphysis where the endosteal borders of the medial and lateral cortices were parallel to each other. We felt that measurements at that level would be too error-prone in routine emergency-unit practices, and chose to use more obvious landmarks which also take account of the individual patient's anatomy and can be readily seen even in a fractured radius. We decided to use the width of the radio-carpal joint surface, since we think that this dimension can be established with sufficient accuracy even in a Type C fracture pattern. The distal radio-ulnar joint was used as a landmark, since, in fractures of the distal radius, the ulnar is often intact and can provide a useful reference. In the inter-observer comparison, there were no significant differences. Both observers mastered the technique after a short initial training, which confirms the intuitive nature of the method. In summary, we conclude that a visual assessment of the metaphyseal cortices on standard radiographs can provide estimation of distal-radius bone density and in the general trauma context, can be a valid decision-making aid to guide the management of fracture patients. Further studies, including clinical investigations, will be required to evaluate the utility of the technique.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>There is no specific acknowledgment.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="afn7644" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:</bold> This study has implication for the researchers as well as practitioners.</p></fn><fn id="afn7645" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Please cite this paper as:</bold> Rausch S, Klos K, Gras F, Skulev HK, Popp A, Hofmann GO, et al.
