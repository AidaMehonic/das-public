We studied the effects of parity or hyperprolactinemia on mammary carcinogenesis in OFA hr/hr treated with 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene. They were divided into three groups: nulliparous (Null), primiparous (PL, after pregnancy and lactation), and hyperprolactinemic rats (I, implanted in the arcuate nucleus with 17<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-estradiol). The tumor incidence was similar in the three groups. However, a higher percentage of regressing tumors was evident in the PL group. Serum PRL, mammary development, and mammary <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-casein content were higher in I rats compared to Null. The expression of hormone receptors was similar in the different groups. However, mammary tissue from PL rats bearing tumors had increased expression of PRL and estrogen alpha receptors compared to rats free of tumors. Our results suggest that serum PRL levels do not have relevance on the incidence of tumors, probably because the low levels of PRL in OFA rats are not further decreased by PL like in other strains. However, supraphysiological levels of PRL affect carcinogenesis. PL induces regression of the tumors due to the differentiation produced on the mammary cells. Alterations in the expression of hormonal receptors may be involved in progression and regression of tumors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Parity is an effective protective factor against breast cancer in women and provides protection against chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis in rats [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although rodent experimental data and human epidemiological evidence consistently show a protective effect of pregnancy on mammary carcinogenesis, the mechanisms underlying this protection are still unclear [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The pregnancy-associated refractoriness of the mammary gland to carcinogenesis is caused in part by lasting phenotypic alterations of the mammary epithelia that occur during pregnancy and lactation [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The endocrine milieu is also a determining factor in the parity-associated refractoriness to mammary carcinogenesis. It has been shown that treatment of rats with both estrogen (E<sub>2</sub>) and progesterone (P<sub>4</sub>) for a short period of time protects against mammary carcinogenesis [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>With some controversy prolactin (PRL) has been proposed as a key player in the development of mammary cancer in rodent models. Thus, a direct correlation between serum PRL levels and susceptibility of various rat strains to induction of mammary tumors by chemical carcinogens has been suggested [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There is also a direct correlation between drug-induced hyperprolactinemia and increased tumor growth and between hypoprolactinemia and retarded tumor growth [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The OFA hr/hr rats are hairless rats derived from Sprague-Dawley with a genetic deficient lactation caused by an impaired response to the suckling stimulus and heightened susceptibility to stress [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The nature of the mutation has been shown to be a large intragenic deletion of the desmoglein-4 gene (Dsg-4) encompassing nine exons [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which codifies for a protein belonging to the desmoglein family. The products of these genes, expressed in neural and neuroendocrine tissues, are cell-adhesion molecules related to cadherins. Similarly to the effects of parity on women, the OFA rats have a persistent reduction in the concentration of serum PRL and blunted PRL response to secretagogues.</p><p>To assess the involvement of serum PRL in the susceptibility of the mammary gland to carcinogenesis, we used OFA hr/hr rats and we compared the effects of parity and lactation or induced hyperprolactinemia on mammary carcinogenesis. In the present study, we show that the incidence of mammary tumors induced by DMBA in OFA rats is not influenced by serum PRL and that the progression and regression of the tumors are dependent on the extent of differentiation produced in the mammary gland by the effects of parity and lactation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Animals</title><p>Virgin OFA hr/hr female rats (180&#x02013;200&#x02009;g) bred in our laboratory were used. The animals were kept in a light (lights on 06.00&#x02013;20.00&#x02009;h) and temperature (22&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C) controlled room; rat chow (Cargill, C&#x000f3;rdoba, Argentina) and tap water were available<italic> ad libitum</italic>.</p><p>Animal maintenance and handling were performed according to the NIH guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication number 86-23, revised 1985 and 1991) and the UK requirements for ethics of animal experimentation (Animals Scientific Procedures, Act 1986).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Experimental Design</title><p>All rats were treated<italic> per os</italic> with a single dose (15&#x02009;mg/rat) of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA, Sigma, Buenos Aires) at 54&#x02013;56 days of age and they were included at random in one of the three experimental groups:<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>controls (nulliparous rats -Null- <italic>n</italic> = 42): rats exposed to DMBA without subsequent treatment;</p></list-item><list-item><p>pregnancy and lactation (primiparous rats -PL-, <italic>n</italic> = 82): twenty-five days after carcinogen administration (80 days of age), rats were caged with fertile males on proestrus afternoon. The following day, all the rats showing spermatozoa in their vaginal smears were caged individually and they were checked for the occurrence of mammary tumor twice a week during the 21 days of pregnancy and afterward for 20 days of lactation. Twenty-four hours after delivery, all the litters were adjusted at 8 pups and were maintained with their mothers until weaning. As previously published [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], OFA rats have normal fertility but 50% of the litters die of malnutrition on early lactation; only 6% of the mothers show normal lactation. Thus, all pups without signs of being properly nourished were replaced for age-matched pups. This procedure did not influence the incidence and the proportion of tumor in regression;</p></list-item><list-item><p>estradiol implants (hyperprolactinemic rats -I-, <italic>n</italic> = 37): twenty-five days after carcinogen administration, the rats were implanted in the arcuate nucleus with 17<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-estradiol as previously described [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, rats were anesthetized by i.p. injection of ketamine hydrochloride (40&#x02009;mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (8&#x02009;mg/kg, i.m.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. In order to access the area immediately above the medial PeV-ARC region, stainless steel cannulae (ID, 0.33&#x02009;mm; OD, 1.78&#x02009;mm; Small Parts, Miami, FLA) were bilaterally implanted through burr holes drilled through the skull over the target sites. The tip of the cannulae was brought to the following coordinates relative to the bregma: 3.0&#x02009;mm posterior, 8.5&#x02009;mm ventral, and 0.6&#x02009;mm right and left. Each cannula was filled with approximately 0.5 &#x000b1; 0.05&#x02009;mg of crystalline 17<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-estradiol (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, MO). The upper end of cannulae protruded 2-3&#x02009;mm from the skull and was fixed to the bone with dental acrylic cement (Subiton, Surrey, UK). The accuracy of cannula placement was checked after euthanasia in the fixed brains by identification of the needle track in brain sections. In general, the tips of the cannulae were above the ARC-PeV region. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the implant of empty cannulas (or filled with placebo) into the arcuate nucleus has no significant effects on PRL secretion [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>All animals were palpated twice a week, starting at day 30 after DMBA administration and for at least 200 days for tumor detection. Incidence was calculated as the percentage of rats that had tumors respect to the total number of rats per group. The rats were decapitated between 10.00 and 12.00&#x02009;h on the day the tumors reached a tumor volume &#x0003e;1000&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> or at the end of the experiment on day 200 when they did not develop mammary tumors. Trunk blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature. Serum was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until assayed for hormones determinations.

Tumor and Mammary Gland Histology</title><p>A small piece of tumor and inguinal mammary gland (contralateral to the tumor) from each rat were processed for histopathologic studies.

No significant differences were found between serum PRL concentrations from the PL rats that did not develop tumors, those that bore nonregressed tumors, and those that bore regressed tumors (not shown). However a decrease (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) in the mammary content of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-casein was evident in the group of rats that developed mammary tumors and had tumor regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>), suggesting a link between regression of the tumors and involution of the mammary gland.</p><p>PRLR expression was significantly lower in mammary glands from rats that did not develop tumors, but no different from those that had regression of the tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>). A similar decrease was observed in the expression of ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(c)</xref>).

Discussion</title><p>To study the involvement of lactogenic hormones in mammary carcinogenesis, we compared our Null or PL rats with virgin rats made hyperprolactinemic through hypothalamic implants of estradiol. In this model, serum estradiol remains at a physiological level [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] allowing us to investigate the effects of PRL excluding the well-known actions of high amounts of E<sub>2</sub> on mammary carcinogenesis.</p><p>A correlation between serum PRL levels and susceptibility of various rat strains to chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis has been suggested [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both GH and PRL have been previously shown to be reduced after parturition as compared with nulliparous, age-matched animals [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, parous rats showing almost complete refractoriness to chemical carcinogenesis acquire high susceptibility after hormonal treatment that increases serum GH and PRL levels [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our OFA rats, neither serum GH nor circulating PRL decreased after PL. Accordingly, even when the incidence of mammary tumors was slightly lower in primiparous rats, the difference respect to nulliparae was not statistically significant, suggesting that the cycle of pregnancy/lactation failed to prevent tumor development in OFA hr/hr rats. This different behavior from the original strain (Sprague-Dawley) [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] regarding the lack of protection induced by pregnancy and lactation might be due to the lower levels of circulating PRL during lactation in the PL OFA rats. Thus, the deficient lactation may have been insufficient to protect the mammary tissue from tumoral transformation. Moreover, despite the persistent hyperprolactinaemia produced in I rats, the incidence of tumors was similar to the other groups, suggesting a null impact of serum PRL levels on mammary carcinogenesis. Interestingly, in I rats, serum PRL was significantly higher in those rats that developed tumors, suggesting that supraphysiological levels of PRL may be relevant in increasing the risk of mammary cancer.</p><p>Our results support the idea that the mammary development<italic> per se</italic> is not enough to account for the protective effect of parity. In fact, the implant of estradiol in the arcuate nucleus produces hyperprolactinemia and luteal phase with high levels of circulating P<sub>4</sub> and mammary development and differentiation similar to pregnancy [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, a protective effect of the implants dependent on the differentiation of the mammary gland could be expected. However, the incidence of mammary tumors in the I group was similar to that in the Null rats, suggesting that the sustained hyperprolactinaemia is not enough to increase carcinogenesis and, moreover, the development of the mammary gland achieved in the implanted rats is not enough to prevent chemical carcinogenesis. In agreement with our results, chronic treatment with perphenazine, producing hyperprolactinemia and high levels of P<sub>4</sub>, did not protect the mammary gland against chemical induction of tumors [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>It is worth noting that, in our model, mammary <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-casein content paralleled the alveolar area measured in the histological preparations, suggesting that the proliferation of epithelial tissue of the mammary gland is accompanied of certain differentiation. This result is in agreement with a previous study in normal Wistar rats [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the percentage of mammary tumors in regression was greatly affected by PL, indicating that the classical protective effect of gestation described by others may be due, at least in part, to an increased number of tumors undergoing regression rather than a decrease of the development of mammary tumors. Our overall results suggest that a cycle of PL has &#x0201c;toxic&#x0201d; effects on the mammary tumors, which cannot be explained only by the milieu of mammogenic hormones, since we did not find any statistically significant difference on serum GH (results not shown) or PRL values, between nulliparous or primiparous rats. On the contrary, the significantly lower content of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-casein in the mammary gland from rats that had regression of their tumors constitutes an interesting support of the idea that involution of the normal epithelia can be implied in the regression of tumors, especially so, when the tumors of the rats with pregnancy and lactation retain the capability to synthesize <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-casein. Studies currently under way in our laboratory are focusing on the expression of several molecular markers involved in the process of involution of the mammary gland after lactation in the regressing tumors.</p><p>We did not find correlation between expression of ARNm of PRLR and serum PRL levels. However, mammary glands from PL rats that had developed tumors had increased expression of PRLR compared to PL rats free of tumors. This difference can explain the higher alveolar development reached in those rats even when the values of circulating PRL at the moment of sacrifice were similar in both groups. The increased development of alveolar tissue may cause, in turn, increased content of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-casein. It is worth to note that both I and PL rats had augmented alveolar development compared to Null rats, but the level of differentiation in terms of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-casein expression is higher in PL rats, supporting a role for the extent of differentiation more than the alveolar development in the protective effect of PL.</p><p>To assess whether the transformation of the mammary cells involves changes in the expression of receptors we studied in parallel the tumors and tissue from the contralateral normal mammary gland in the same animals. The expression of ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> increased in tumors of hyperprolactinemic rats compared to the contralateral mammary gland, but it was unmodified in Null or PL rats (results not-shown). The ability of PRL to stimulate the expression of both types of ER has been shown in the rat corpus luteum, in the mammary gland, and in the decidua (see [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] for a review). Previous reports suggest that PRL can stimulate ER expression in some breast cancers [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, PRL can activate ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> even in the absence of estrogenic ligands leading to oncogenesis [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our study, the expression of ER<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> decreased in the tumors from the three groups compared to their respective mammary glands (not shown), suggesting a protective role for ER<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>. This result supports previous studies showing a decrease in the expression of ER<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> in the process of human breast cancer progression associated with poor differentiation [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, the expression of ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> was higher in untransformed mammary tissue from Null or PL rats that developed mammary tumors compared with those that did not. On the contrary, hyperprolactinemic rats that developed tumors had lower expression of ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in their mammary tissue. This particular result may suggest that when supraphysiological levels of circulating PRL are constantly acting on the mammary gland, tumors can progress even with lower expression of ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion, in our model of carcinogenesis using OFA hr/hr rats we showed that serum PRL levels do not seem to have relevance on the incidence of tumors, probably because the relative low levels of PRL in those rats are not further decreased by pregnancy and lactation like in other strains. Even though, supraphysiological levels of serum PRL may affect carcinogenesis.</p><p>On the other hand, PL induces regression of the tumors most probably due to the degree of differentiation produced on the mammary cells than to the extent of proliferation reached by the epithelial tissue. Alterations in the expression of hormonal receptors may be involved in both progression and regression of the tumors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are deeply indebted to Mrs. Elina Gui&#x000f1;az&#x000fa; de Di Nasso and Mr. Juan Rosales for their excellent technical assistance.
