The absence of an endogenous luteolysin in absence of pregnancy results in long-lasting physiological pseudopregnancy, strongly contrasting with the acute luteolysis observed prepartum. The underlying biological mechanisms and the involvement of P4 signalling remain, however, not fully understood. Therefore, here, next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on CL from the late luteal phase and compared with normally luteolyzing CL collected at the prepartum P4 decrease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The contrast &#x0201c;luteal regression over luteolysis&#x0201d; yielded 1595 differentially expressed genes (DEG). The CL in late luteal regression were predominantly associated with functional terms linked to extracellular matrix (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5.52e-05). Other terms related to transcriptional activity (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.45e-04), and steroid hormone signalling (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.29e-04), which were more highly represented in late regression than during luteolysis. The prepartum luteolysis was associated with immune inflammatory responses (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.87e-14), including acute-phase reaction (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.10e-06). Immune system-related events were also more highly represented in CL derived from normal luteolysis (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7.02e-04), compared with those from dogs in which luteolysis was induced with an antigestagen (1480 DEG in total). Additionally, the withdrawal of P4 at mid-gestation resulted in 92 DEG; over-represented terms enriched in antigestagen-treated dogs were related to the inflammatory response (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.005) or response to IL1 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7.29e-05). Terms related to proliferation, e.g., centrosome organization (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002) and steroid metabolic processes (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001), prevailed at mid-gestation. Thereby, our results revealed the nature of luteotropic effects of P4 within canine CL. It appears that, even though they result in diminished steroidogenic output, the effect of antigestagens is more related to the withdrawal of P4 support than to the PGF2alpha-related inflammatory reaction observed at physiological parturition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">We report the differential gene expression associated with maintenance and cessation of luteal function in pregnant and non-pregnant dogs. Based on the differentially expressed genes, we indicate functional pathways and gene networks that are potentially involved in the underlying endocrine and molecular mechanisms. This study establishes future research directions that may be helpful in understanding some of the clinical conditions, such as luteal insufficiency, associated with negative pregnancy outcome in dogs.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-017-4084-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dog (<italic>Canis familiaris</italic>)</kwd><kwd>CL</kwd><kwd>Luteal regression</kwd><kwd>Prepartum luteolysis</kwd><kwd>Induced abortion</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SNSF 31003A_160251</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">The domestic dog is classified as a mono-estric, polytocous and aseasonal breeder, with an obligatory quiescence phase called anestrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although canine reproduction has already attracted some attention, still many of the species-specific peculiarities remain not fully understood. Unlike in livestock, the dog lacks placental steroidogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, luteal P4 is the only major source of circulating levels of this hormone, both in non-pregnant cycles and during pregnancy. The lifespan of corpora lutea (CL) in non-pregnant bitches often outlasts the luteal duration in pregnant animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The luteal phase and P4 levels are almost identical in both situations until around day 60, i.e., prior to parturition when a steep decline of serum P4 is observed in pregnant dogs, indicating prepartum luteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In contrast, in the non-pregnant dog a slow decline of P4 is observed, until basal levels of P4 reach &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;ng/ml, indicating the onset of anestrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, at least in non-pregnant dogs, the function of CL is independent of a uterine luteolysin (PGF2alpha), and remains unaffected by hysterectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Also, a luteolytic function of intraluteally produced prostaglandins can be ruled out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In pregnant dogs, the prepartum decline of P4 is concomitant with increased circulating levels of PGF2alpha, predominantly of fetal placental origin, indicating its role during parturition and/or luteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">During the early luteal phase, canine CL exhibit decreased sensitivity to gonadotropic support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and luteal PGE2 seems to be a potent luteotropic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The period of relative gonadotropin independence ends at around day 25 post ovulation (p.o.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and prolactin (PRL) becomes the main luteotropic factor thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, despite the continuously increasing availability of PRL and luteinizing hormone (LH), during the second half of diestrus luteal regression sets in, associated with structural degeneration of CL and without any signs of strong apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Consequently, based on the evidence so far, regression of the CL in the dog seems to be a passive degenerative process (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]). Only during prepartum luteolysis are the acute PGF2alpha surge and the concomitant steep fall of P4 associated with massive apoptotic activity within the CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Interestingly, there is no pregnancy- and/or parturition-related increase in estrogens in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The luteotropic role of P4 is substantiated by the fact that application of an antigestagen induces the utero-placental signaling cascade, unequivocally resulting in preterm luteolysis/abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The role of the immune system in canine CL function is still not fully elucidated. Hoffmann and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] reported the time-dependent presence of CD4- and CD8-positive immune cells along with cells staining positively for MHC II complex in the CL tissue of non-pregnant dogs. Additionally, expression of several interleukins (IL) and cytokines was confirmed at different stages of development in non-pregnant canine CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recently, similar observations have been made with regards to canine CL of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], implying an active involvement of the immune system in the prepartum luteolytic cascade.</p><p id="Par7">Nevertheless, regulatory mechanisms governing the canine CL lifespan, and especially differences in termination of CL function in pregnant vs. non-pregnant bitches, remain not fully understood. Therefore, aiming to obtain deeper insights into underlying endocrine regulatory mechanisms, herein, a next-generation deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was employed to investigate global gene expression during the maintenance and cessation of canine CL function. Luteal samples collected at prepartum luteolysis were compared with corresponding samples from non-pregnant dogs obtained during late CL regression (day 65 p.o.). The changes evoked by prepartum PGF2alpha release were assessed by comparing mid-gestation samples with those from active prepartum luteolysis. Additionally, in order to assess P4-dependent effects, samples were obtained from bitches in which pre-term luteolysis/abortion was induced at mid-term by the antigestagen aglepristone. The global gene expression in these samples was compared with natural prepartum luteolysis as well as with mid-pregnant dogs.</p><p id="Par8">This is the first comprehensive, comparative transcriptome analysis of canine CL in pregnant and non-pregnant bitches during cessation of the CL life span, including a functional approach demonstrating antigestagen-mediated effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals, tissue sampling and preservation</title><p id="Par9">All animal experiments and use of tissue samples were in accordance with animal welfare legislation and were approved by the respective authorities of the Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany (permit no.

Thus, corpora lutea (CL) from clinically healthy, cross-breed bitches (aged 2&#x02013;8&#x000a0;years) were used representing the following experimental groups: (Group-1) mid-pregnancy (days 35&#x02013;40 post ovulation, p.o.; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5); (Group-2) active prepartum luteolysis (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3); (Group-3) antigestagen-treated mid-gestation group (days 40&#x02013;45 p.o.; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5); (Group-4) non-pregnant bitches at late CL regression (day 65 p.o.; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5).</p><p id="Par10">In all dogs the time of ovulation was determined by measurements of plasma P4 (&#x0003e; 5&#x000a0;ng/ml) and by vaginal histology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Pregnant dogs were mated 2&#x000a0;days after ovulation (Day 0), which in the dog is the time needed for completion of oocyte maturation within the oviduct. To determine active prepartum luteolysis (Group-2), P4 concentrations in peripheral blood plasma were measured at 6&#x000a0;h intervals beginning on day 58 of pregnancy; when P4 levels in 3 consecutive measurements fell below 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;ng/ml, the tissue material was collected. The respective P4 levels are presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

Because of similar P4 profiles these mechanisms must differ mostly during termination of luteal function. Consequently, here, for the first time a comparative, new generation sequencing analysis was performed to investigate the transcriptome of canine CL during the cessation of their function in pregnant and non-pregnant animals. Additionally samples from pregnant dogs in which prepartum luteolysis/abortion was induced at mid-gestation with the antigestagen aglepristone, were included.</p><p id="Par51">One of our main goals was to compare samples collected during late luteal regression (day 65 after ovulation) with those from active prepartum luteolysis. At this point, it is important to emphasize that in the dog the prepartum luteolysis (characterized by actively decreasing P4 concentrations) already begins 12-42&#x000a0;h before any clinical and/or behavioral (e.g., nest building) signs of parturition become visible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, as presented here, it is extremely important to capture the right time point for collection of samples in order to validate them as being derived from prepartum luteolysis. Pairwise alignments were performed between the respective experimental groups.</p><p id="Par52">When compared with prepartum luteolysis, the slow luteal regression in non-pregnant bitches was characterized by functional terms related to structural changes of the tissue, e.g., remodeling and organization of extracellular matrix. The steroid hormone-mediated signaling and activities, as well as factors related to regulation of gene expression, were also more highly represented in regressing CL. Genes involved in modification of matrix were represented, e.g., by PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor &#x003b1;) or ECM2 (extracellular matrix protein 2). Interestingly, some of the nuclear steroidogenic receptors were detected within the overrepresented group of genes involved in structural changes in regressing canine CL, e.g., AR (androgen receptor), ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1, the gene encoding for estrogen receptor ER&#x003b1;) or NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor). In view of the postulated supportive effects of estrogens on luteal maintenance, based on circulating profiles of E2 closely matching those of P4 in pregnant and non-pregnant bitches, the diminishing effects of luteolysis on the ESR1 (ER&#x003b1;) expression drew our attention. The cAMP-mediated signaling was among the pathways more strongly represented during luteal regression than at prepartum luteolysis. The cAMP/PKA-related transcriptional activities are well known as the major positive regulators of steroidogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Thus, it can be concluded that the ongoing remodeling, morphogenesis and connective tissue development processes found in regressing canine CL are associated with higher functional and steroidogenic activities, compared with active prepartum luteolysis. This clearly can be seen in conjunction with the slowly ongoing functional and morphological changes associated with corpus albicans formation as a result of ageing of the steroidogenic apparatus and its replacement by matrix and connective tissue components.</p><p id="Par53">The expression of selected target genes more highly represented in regressing canine CL was verified. Among these was ECM2, which has been proved to promote matrix assembly and cell adhesiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We also examined the expression of RXFP1, a receptor for relaxin (RLN) proven to be involved in the maintenance of connective tissue extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and which influences the control of collagen turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Importantly, in some species like pigs and rodents, a luteotropic function of intraluteally produced RLN has been implied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. GATA4 and GATA6, both GATA binding proteins and transcriptional factors, are important for the synthesis of luteal P4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. They are known to activate promoters of various steroidogenic genes, e.g., steroidogenic acute regulatory (STAR) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450 gene (CYP11A1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] or 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3betaHSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Another gene of possible functional importance with higher expression in the luteal regression group was SULT1E1 (sulfotransferase family 1E member 1 also known as estrogen sulfotransferase/EST), a key enzyme for catalyzing the sulfoconjugation of estrogens. This leads to their inactivation by preventing them from binding to their respective estrogen receptors, ER&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The increased expression of SULT1E1 during luteal regression could thus be involved in the functional withdrawal of local estrogen effects in the canine CL. An additional role for this enzyme during the ongoing fatty degeneration of regressing/luteolytic canine CL appears plausible, as its involvement in positive regulation of adipogenesis has been shown, e.g., in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This hypothesis, however, requires further verification.</p><p id="Par54">A completely different picture regarding endocrine regulatory events emerges when functional terms and networks overrepresented during active prepartum luteolysis are considered. The vast majority of genes more highly represented in this group, compared with luteal regression, are related to immune and inflammatory response, including activation of leukocytes and acute-phase response. Also terms related to negative regulation of steroidogenesis, degeneration of mitochondria and apoptosis were found. The acute phase response is an immediate reaction based on inflammation due to various elicitors such as tissue injury, infection and trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. SAA (serum amyloid A protein) is one of the acute phase proteins. During inflammation, the baseline concentrations of this protein can increase by more than 1000-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Here, the high abundance of the respective transcript was positively verified during active prepartum luteolysis in the dog by semi-quantitative PCR. Cytokines that are synthesized during an inflammatory process are the main stimulators of the acute-phase protein production, for example IL1&#x003b2;, IL6, TNF&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, TGF&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and possibly IL8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The functional pathways and top upstream regulators detected by IPA software, as well as overrepresented networks detected by Cytoscape during luteolysis, indicate induction of the luteal immune system at prepartum. Thus, besides the already mentioned activation of IL6 and IL8 signaling, in addition the NF&#x003ba;B signaling pathway and overrepresentation of the TNF and LPS systems were found, as well as the induction of TGF&#x003b2; pathway. Interestingly, the TGF&#x003b2; signaling was shown to possess profibrotic and anti-angiogenic potential, contributing thereby to structural and functional luteolysis in the bovine CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Among the selected genes investigated in our study by semi-quantitative PCR and belonging to the immune response were: CXCL8 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8; IL-8), IL1B (interleukin 1 beta), MHCII (major histocompatibility complex, class II), CCL3 (chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3) or CCL13 (chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 13). The proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 is synthesized predominantly by macrophages and neutrophils, which are recruited to the site of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. It is known for its chemotactic activity directed towards T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. CCL3 and CCL13 are both chemokine ligands, whose main task is to act as chemoattractants to draw active immune cells to the site of inflammation. MHCII proteins, in turn, are located on antigen-presenting cells and play important roles during initiation of the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Cumulatively, it becomes apparent that active prepartum luteolysis in the dog represents a highly inflammatory, acute event, involving activation of multiple pathways responsible for the immune response. This reaction seems to be triggered by concomitantly increasing utero-placental PGF2alpha. It is noteworthy that, regarding potential involvement of the immune system in the regulation of luteal function during active prepartum luteolysis in the dog, our results corroborate observations made previously in other species, e.g. in rodents, humans or farm animals like sheep, pigs, cattle and horses, as reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">The acute inflammatory nature of luteolysis also becomes obvious when comparing the mid-gestation group with prepartum luteolysis. Whereas in mid-pregnant dogs the remodelling processes associated with structural CL regression were already clearly visible, also in this contrast the prepartum luteolysis was characterized by inflammatory- and acute-phase responses, including NF&#x003ba;B-, TNF- and LPS- mediated effects, as well as by apoptotic signaling. Similarly, the expression of selected target genes (IL1b, CCL3, CCL13 and MHCII) was confirmed, displaying higher levels during natural luteolysis. TGF&#x003b2; signaling was represented both by genes relating to structural remodelling during mid-gestation (detected by Bioconductor), and to inflammatory pathways found by IPA software during prepartum luteolysis. This further underlines its possible involvement in morphological and functional cessation of the canine CL life span.</p><p id="Par57">Antigestagen treatment results in preterm luteolysis/abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and accelerates luteal regression in mid-luteal, non-pregnant bitches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The underlying molecular and endocrine mechanisms associated with the functional withdrawal of P4 remain, however, not completely understood. This prompted us to investigate the impact of aglepristone on the luteal transcriptome in mid-pregnant dogs, comparing them with non-treated controls. Therefore, the experimental contrast &#x0201c;mid-gestation over antigestagen&#x0201d; was established. However, this contrast resulted in the highest variability of gene expression. Thus, despite the relatively high number of genes, the expression of which differed at the applied level of <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01 (429 genes), when the corrected <italic>p</italic>-value (FDR) of &#x0003c;0.1 was applied, the list of DEG became restricted to 92 genes. This strongly limited interpretation of these results. It appears, however, that application of antigestagen to mid-pregnant dogs results in induction of the immune response and suppresses terms related to proliferation and protein metabolism. These effects were mirrored by higher expression of selected target genes validated by semi-quantitative PCR. Thus, the cyclin A2 (CCNA2), an important positive regulator of cell cycle progression, was more highly expressed in the CL of control mid-pregnant dogs. Interestingly, however, although it was significantly enriched at the level of <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01, expression of this gene did not pass the initially applied FDR &#x0003c;0.1 selection criterion. Additionally, we found increased expression of transcriptionally and steroidogenically active GATA4 and RXFP1, during mid-pregnancy. On the other hand, the immune system-derived CCL3 was elevated in treated CL. Cumulatively, based on the results presented herein, and despite the high variability of results obtained in the discussed contrast (i.e., mid-gestation over antigestagen), the luteotropic function of P4 within canine CL may be related to positive regulation of the cell cycle, proliferation and transcriptional activity, and anti-inflammatory effects.</p><p id="Par58">Interestingly, as revealed in the next comparison, although it led to suppression of luteal steroidogenesis, when compared with the natural prepartum luteolysis, the antigestagen treatment evoked weaker immune and inflammatory reactions. Instead, as in the previous contrast, the inhibitory effects related predominantly to cell proliferation, also inhibition of transcription and gene expression was prevalent. Additionally, Cytoscape assigned genes associated with functional networks relating to the response to TGF&#x003b2; in the antigestagen-treated group. Among these were genes associated with structural remodelling of tissue such as ADAMTSL2. Among representative genes expressed more during natural luteolysis and positively validated by semi-quantitative PCR were immunoreactive factors involved in the acute response, such as CXCL8 (IL8) and SAA. Besides the acute inhibition of P4 production during natural luteolysis, the functional withdrawal of P4 during this time was marked by higher expression of transcripts encoding for CYP17A1 (steroid-17<italic>alpha</italic>-hydroxylase) enzyme. Acting upon P4, CYP17A1 catalyzes its conversion to the less biologically potent 17-OHP (17-hydroxyprogesterone).</p><p id="Par59">Changes induced in luteal transcriptomes, commonly regulated during normal and induced luteolysis, were compared using Venn diagrams. First, we aimed to compare the changes induced by endogenous PGF2alpha in late regressing CL (i.e., during natural luteolysis), with the antigestagen-mediated changes evoked in fully active CL. Therefore, the two contrasts &#x0201c;luteal regression over luteolysis&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;mid-gestation over antigestagen&#x0201d; were chosen. We found two genes, CYP17A1 and SULT1E1, which were commonly represented more during luteal regression and mid-gestation over their luteolytic counterparts. Thus, both genes that were less expressed in CL dominated by apoptosis are involved in controlling luteal steroidogenic capability. Genes which were commonly more highly expressed in luteolytic groups included some of the immune system-relevant factors like C5AR2 (CD88).</p><p id="Par60">In the next comparison we were interested to find the genes characteristic of antigestagen-mediated effects. The two contrasts submitted to the analysis were: &#x0201c;luteolysis over antigestagen&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;mid-gestation over antigestagen&#x0201d;. We found CYP17A, being commonly less expressed in antigestagen-treated samples in both contrasts. Among genes commonly more represented in the antigestagen groups of this contrast were CSRNP3 (known as TGF-&#x003b2;-induced apoptosis protein 2) and ELL2 (elongation factor for RNA polymerase II 2), a regulator of gene transcription.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">Herein, deeper insights have been obtained into possible cellular mechanisms governing the luteal life span in the domestic dog during pregnancy and in non-pregnant cycles.

The contribution of the immune system seems to be critical in the PGF2alpha-mediated active prepartum luteolysis, which appears to be an acute immune process.

These effects cumulatively point towards the withdrawal of the luteotropic function of P4.</p><p id="Par64">The P4-mediated effects can be especially important for understanding some of the clinical conditions associated with the negative pregnancy outcomes, such as luteal insufficiency which affects some bitches.</p><p id="Par65">Finally, several differentially expressed genes were identified within the experimental groups representing different functional pathways and networks and being possibly involved in the maintenance and cessation of canine luteal function. Some of them deserve closer attention for determining future research directions, like the TGF&#x003b2;-mediated pathways. Similarly, the cellular origin and functional interplay between different immune system-derived factors need further clarification. Future studies will also need to focus on translating information obtained from investigating the transcriptome to functional studies at the protein level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
