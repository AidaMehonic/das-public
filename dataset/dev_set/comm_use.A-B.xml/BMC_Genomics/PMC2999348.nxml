This modeling method requires techniques that maintain a reasonable accuracy of the biological process and also reduces the computational overhead. This objective motivates the use of new methods that can transform the problem from energy and affinity based modeling to information theory based modeling. To achieve this, we transform all dynamics within the cell into a random event time, which is specified through an information domain measure like probability distribution.

The next challenge is to understand the complex interactions of biological processes and functions creating the intelligence of life. The complexity increases manifold as we move into higher scales: interaction of large ensemble of cells in a tissue or interaction of tissues in an organ. Thus, we need to develop a comprehensive model integrating molecular and genetic data for quantitative studies of physiology and behavior of biological processes at multiple scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Existing models used in the understanding of biological processes can be divided into three main classes. Quantum Mechanics based models (femtosecond-picosecond; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-11-S3-S3-i1.gif"/></inline-formula>) are used to understand the structure of macro molecules. The functional understanding of biological molecules (like binding properties, configuration states after binding and other individual properties of the molecular reactions) are well studied by the Molecular dynamics based model (picosecond-nanosecond; 1nm-10nm). The next challenge is to understand the biological intelligence created by the usage of the macro molecules in the cell. These are accomplished by the Mesoscale Dynamics (nanosecond-seconds; 10nm-1mm) models, and Cellular-level/Organ-level simulation schemes. Such simulation schemes are again broadly classified into two categories: (a) Continuous system models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], employing differential equations to simulate cellular dynamics used in tools like Dizzy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and JARNAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; (b) Stochastic discrete time models, like StochSim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and M-cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], that have been developed for capturing the stochastic nature of molecular interactions within the existing framework of rate equations in continuous time domain. Most of these models focus on intracellular biochemical reactions and require accurate estimation of a very large number of system parameters for providing systemic understanding of underlying processes. More integrative tools at the whole cell level have also been developed, which try to model cellular mechanisms and present visual representation of their functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Recently, it was shown that gene expression type interactions create a stochastic resonance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] within the system and hence deterministic models are inappropriate for this process. The Gilliespie simulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] incorporates the dynamics of the chemical master equation by approximately handling the stochasticity of the mass-kinetic equations. As the temporal variability of reaction time is appreciable within a biological process, this method suffers from simulation stiffness. Moreover, this model represents the biological pathways through a set of reaction equations without showing their relation to the biological functions creating the pathway. Any change in the pathway description may change the complete set of equations. Also their approach has computational overheads and require estimates of all the rate constants. With the existing systems in perspective, we present a discrete-event driven paradigm - modeling a composite system by combining the state variables in the time-space domain as events and determining the immediate dynamics between the events by using statistical analysis or simulation methods. To reduce computational overhead we transform the different diffusion and molecular interactions within a cell from the thermodynamic energy based fields to the information theory field by suitable abstraction of the energy field profiles into selected statistical distributions. Our goals are to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]: (1) Use the results of the Quantum Mechanics based models (molecular structure data) and Molecular dynamics models (molecular binding data) to create the micro-level biological event models. (2) Transform the energy driven biological effects to information theory parameters in the probabilistic domain considering the biological functions. (3) Develop event models to estimate the statistics of the biological event. (4) Develop a discrete-event based &#x0201c;in silico&#x0201d; simulation for complex systems.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We briefly present an overview on the different modeling and simulation paradigms in Section Modeling and Simulation landscape. Next, we introduce the discrete event based simulation framework in Section Discrete Event Simulation Technique. In Section PhoPQ Biological System Model, we present the concept of event abstraction of biological pathways using the PhoPQ biological system in Salmonella. We introduce the analytical models for the molecular transport mechanisms in Section Analytical Models for Molecular Transport. In Section Numerical Results for the Molecular Transport Models, we present the performance results and validation of the molecular transport models. Section Simulation Results of the PhoPQ system presents some in silico results from the discrete event simulation of the PhoPQ system, to validate the performance of the simulation engine and also provides some examples of in silico hypothesis tests. Finally, we conclude in Section Conclusion and provide some directions for future work. A short version of this paper appeared in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><sec><title>Modeling and simulation landscape</title><p>The inherent complexity involved in the molecular processes governing life has motivated the development of computational modeling and simulation techniques to decipher their ensemble dynamics. In this section, we provide an overview of the wide spectrum of in silico modeling and simulation methodologies available for system-wide study of biological processes.</p><p>Mathematical models have being extensively used for intracellular molecular networks like kinase cascades and metabolic pathways, gene regulatory networks and protein interaction networks. A large section of the work in computational models of biological systems is based on classical chemical kinetic (CCK) formalism based on a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE), also known as reaction rate equations or mass action kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Representing a homogeneous biological system as a set of biochemical reactions, the temporal dynamics of the molecular species is studied in the continuous-deterministic domain. A large number of computational tools, which provide a software platform for building, storing and parameterizing a set of biochemical reactions and solving those using numerical techniques, are available, like Gepasi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], Jarnac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], CyberCell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], Promot /DIVA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], Stode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These rate-based models have been successfully applied to study gene expression and other molecular reaction systems.</p><p>While continuous-deterministic reaction models are capable of capturing behavioral dynamics for spatially homogeneous systems with large number of molecular species, the inherent stochasticity observed in many biological processes (gene expression and protein synthesis) have proven the limitation of CCK in accurately representing biological processes. In a recent article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], Arkin et.al have shown the limitations of CCK in several common biological scenarios, where stochastic reaction dynamics present a more accurate picture of the systems behavior. Stochastic models, which present an accurate approximation for the chemical master equation (CME), have been developed, largely based on Gillespie&#x02019;s algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this method, the next reaction event and the time associated with it are computed based on a probability distribution (Monte Carlo Step). Stochastic tools, like StochSim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], have been developed based on Gillespie&#x02019;s technique and its computationally efficient variants like Gibson-Bruck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and tau-leaping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A large number of tools, which provide an integrative environment to build and study biochemical reaction systems in an exchangeable format (like Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)) using deterministic as well as stochastic techniques are available, like E-Cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], Virtual Cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], Dizzy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], CyberCell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and M-Cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These techniques are based on treating a biological process as a system of equations, represented by their rate constants and other parameters (like volume, cell density etc.) and simulating their interactions through numerical techniques or Monte Carlo based stochastic simulations.</p><p>Another technique in building abstract computational models for biosimulation has been developed based on Petri nets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and stochastic process algebra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These methods present a mathematical formalism for representing biochemical pathways within and between cells. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the authors present a stochastic Petri net (SPN) model for studying simple chemical reactions (SPN model of ColE1 plasmid replication) and show how existing softwares can be used to perform structural analysis based on numerical techniques. Discrete event system specifications based on Devs &#x00026;amp; StateCharts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and Stochastic &#x003c0; calculus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] have been successfully demonstrated to provide a computational platform for temporal simulation of complex biological systems. Hillston et. al have developed a mathematical technique, Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (PEPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], wherein functionality is captured at the level of pathways rather than molecules and the system is represented as a continuous time Markov chain.</p><p>Other simulation methodologies, based on object oriented and agent based (ABM) paradigms have also been studied for in silico modeling of complex bio-processes by Uhramacher et.al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], the authors have developed AgentCell, an ABM based digital assay for the study of bacterial chemotaxis. Simulation platforms, based on discrete events, where the events are modeled on rate constants and measured experimental data, have been demonstrated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>The overarching theme, guiding the development of in silico modeling and simulation tools, is developing models based on continuous-deterministic ODEs or using stochastic simulation algorithms (SSA) for approximating the chemical master equation, which capture the temporal evolution of the biological process dynamics. Most of these techniques focus on molecular pathways, which are represented in graphical and mathematical formalisms, treat spatial dynamics in terms of well-defined cellular compartments, and abstract the complexity in terms of estimated parameters and rate constants. In the next section, we briefly outline our modeling and simulation technique, based on a discrete event system specification, where the molecular events (representing reactions, molecular/ionic transport etc) are mechanistically modeled depending on their biophysical characteristics to compute the probability distribution of their execution times. A discrete event simulation system then links the biological processes to simulate the behavior emerging from the interaction of the events in time.</p></sec><sec><title>Discrete event simulation technique</title><p>In a discrete-event based approach, the dynamics of the system are captured by discrete time-space state variables, where an event is a combined process of large number of state transitions between a set of state variables accomplished within event execution time. The underlying assumption is that it is possible to segregate the complete state-space into such disjoint sets of independent events which can execute simultaneously without any interaction.</p><p>We consider a biological process as a system of resources (typically the various molecules, ions, ribosome-chromosome operon etc involved in the system) that periodically change between one of the following four states (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) based on the underlying resource usage algorithms: (i) &#x02018;used&#x02019; (e.g, an enzyme is busy in a reaction), (ii) &#x02018;idle&#x02019;(e.g, an enzyme is free to enter a new reaction), (iii) &#x02018;created&#x02019; (e.g, a molecule is created by a reaction) and (iv) &#x02018;decayed&#x02019; (e.g, a molecule is in the process of disintegration at the end of its life-cycle). The transitions from one state to another are governed by transition flow rates of the dynamic functions involved in the process in a cell. The process is initiated by a set of input signal(s) from the external world to the system. These input signals initiate the creation of dynamic events which drive the simulation across in time domain, capturing how the system resources change states.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>State transition diagram of an enzyme during its life cycle</bold> A biological process is visualized as a system of resources periodically changing between one of the following four states based on the underlying resource usage algorithms: (i) &#x02018;used&#x02019; (e.g, an enzyme is busy in a reaction), (ii) &#x02018;idle&#x02019;(e.g, an enzyme is free to enter a new reaction), (iii) &#x02018;created&#x02019; (e.g, a molecule is created by a reaction) and (iv) &#x02018;decayed&#x02019; (e.g, a molecule is in the process of disintegration at the end of its life-cycle).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows a section of the reaction pathway of a biological process with these two types of events. A salient feature of this approach is the balance between computational complexity and accuracy of the estimate by including the biological function details as much as possible. The resource interaction between the different events, specially resource conflicts, resource blocking and system dead locks are automatically identified by the simulation. Thus, we can track the important resource counts and identify the exact time of occurrence of these events and direct the next actions based on the outcome. In addition, the simulation can show how the resource dynamics in the system depend on time and external input signal rate, initial values of the resources used in the simulation and the logic of the resource usage algorithms (i.e., the gradual internal changes due to the input signal and the propagation of its effect into the whole system).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Modeling scheme for pathway abstraction</bold> Schematic representation of the two types of event models required in our simulation approach: (1) event execution time, and (2) probability of next event type.

Based on available information, we have developed a functional event diagram (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) of the process. We identify the list of discrete events that can be included in the simulation based on the available knowledge of the system. In other words, we need to identify the various types of molecules, cells, tissues etc which are involved in the resource usage algorithm for an event (either in reactions, or as catalysts or as end products). To find the time taken for an event, it is important to identify the parameters which affect the interaction of the resources in a particular biological discrete event process and mapping them into the time domain (i.e. identifying the time required for completion of the biological discrete event processing as a function of these parameters). The event holding time algorithms are modeled by stochastic models, diffusion equations and so on.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Biological processes involved in the PhoPQ process in Salmonella</bold> functional event diagram of the PhoP/PhoQ two component regulatory system with the list of discrete events included in the simulation based on the available knowledge of the system.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-11-S3-S3-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>PhoPQ biological system model</title><p>In Salmonella, virulence is produced by the two-component PhoPQ system that is activated by <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> concentration change.

The schematic block diagram of the processes which we have identified to capture the pathway details is presented first. For each process block, we have some input signal(s) coming into the process and output signal(s) which can be considered as the outcome of the process and can trigger one or more processes (or the same process itself in a feedback mechanism).

Currently, many pathway databases have been established maintaining this record for different species which we use to understand this process. With the departure of a <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> molecule, the phoQ protein auto-phosphorylates (kinase activity) by making use of an ATP molecule from the cell. The phosphatase activity of phoQ regulates the phosphotransfer mechanism to phosphorylate the phoP protein under micromolar <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and dephosphorylates the phosphorylated phoP molecules under millimolar <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Generally, <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> concentrations higher than 250 mM stimulate the dephosphorylation of phospho-phoP (also called phoPp). Two independent mechanisms of dephosphorylation of phoPp occur. One involves the reversion of the reaction that takes place to phosphorylate the response regulator, and the other is a specific phoPp phosphatase induced by high concentrations of <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> that renders the release of inorganic phosphate.</p><p>Thus we can identify the following discrete events from the PhoPQ pathway: with the departure of a <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> molecule (event: ion diffusion from membrane protein), the phoQ protein autophosphorylates (kinase activity) by making use of an ATP molecule from the cell (event: membrane reaction). The phosphate activity of the phoQ regulates the phosphotransfer mechanism to phosphorylate the phoP protein under micro molar <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and dephosphorylates the phosphorylated phoP molecules under millimolar <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> concentrations (event: cytoplasmic reaction). The Phospho PhoP (phoPp) activates the promoter loci and there is only one activation per phoPp. The loci are obtained from the determination of regulatory pathway. phoPp binding to DNA site is required for transcription (event: DNA protein binding). RNA polymerases are involved in the process of transcription (event: cytoplasmic multi molecule reaction). We also need to consider translation (including steps such as binding of polymerases, regulatory factors, subunits etc) and transport processes.</p><p>Thus we can identify many different biological functions and separate models are required to estimate their characteristics.

We have identified the following movement models for biological processes: (a) diffusion of charged ions (e.g. <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup>) in the cell (to model the <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> arrival/departure process); (b) diffusion of non-charged molecules (to model the transport function of phospho-PhoP in the cytosol); (c) diffusion of charged ions out of the cell (to model the <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> departure process out of the cell). This movement model should also consider the breakage of the ionic bond between <italic>Mg</italic><sup>2+</sup> and phoQ molecules for the diffusion to occur; (d) The fourth movement model is the movement of ions or molecules due to additional energy provided by the pump system.

At present it is difficult to directly link the results of the simulation to the wet lab experiments data that we have. This is because simulation gives the temporal dynamics in actual molecular count, whereas the fluorescent tag based wet lab experiments only show the sensitivity of the fluorescent light. It was not possible to calibrate the fluorescent tag sensitivity to molecular count per cell in the past. Thus our simulation results validate the similarity of the temporal dynamics of experimental results now, without actual comparison of the molecular count of a cell. Currently more sophisticated experiments like microfluidic based single cell assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] allows real time observation of single molecules in a cell.

For this, we need the transformation of biological functions into information theory based measure like probability distributions of event time. We have presented one example of the transformation of a biological function (i.e., molecular transport time) driven by concentration and potential gradients in this paper. We also validated the molecular transport models and put together a discrete event simulation for the PhoPQ system to validate the system level dynamics based results with experimental estimates. We also used this molecular transport model to generate some in-silico hypothesis testing results on the PhoPQ system.</p><p>The proposed stochastic models meet the accuracy and computational speed requirements for modeling complex biological processes. These models are parametric and can be used for different cases of molecular transport. Once the complete set of mathematical models for the different biological functions are in place, it should be possible to reuse these models to construct other biological process models with marginal changes. The models provide for both speed of computation and flexibility that is required to model the dynamics of an entire cell. We envisage the development of an efficient tool for understanding the dynamics of complex biological systems that can model the multi-scale biological process at a coarse grain accuracy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors contributions</title><p>PG helped with the development of the model and simulation and generating the results.
