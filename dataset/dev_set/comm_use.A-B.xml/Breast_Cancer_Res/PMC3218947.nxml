This study was performed to identify the carrier proteoglycan (PG) and the sulfotransferase gene involved in synthesis of the surface P-selectin-reactive CS-GAGs in human breast cancer cells with high metastatic capacity, as well as to determine a direct role for CS-GAGs in metastatic spread.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and flow cytometry assays were used to detect the expression of genes involved in the sulfation and presentation of chondroitin in several human breast cancer cell lines. Transient transfection of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with the siRNAs for carbohydrate (chondroitin 4) sulfotransferase-11 (<italic>CHST11</italic>) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (<italic>CSPG4 </italic>) was used to investigate the involvement of these genes in expression of surface P-selectin ligands. The expression of <italic>CSPG4 </italic>and <italic>CHST11 </italic>in 15 primary invasive breast cancer clinical specimens was assessed by qRT-PCR.

Among glycans that play a critical role in stromal tumor cell interactions are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) attached to proteoglycans (PGs). Altered production levels of PGs and structural changes in their GAGs are reported in many neoplastic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. GAGs are polysaccharide chains covalently attached to protein cores that together comprise PGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and based on the prevalence of GAG chains, chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS) PGs (CS/DS-PGs), heparan sulfate PGs and keratan sulfate PGs have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Increased production of CS/DS-GAGs is found in transformed fibroblasts and mammary carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and it has been shown that these polysaccharides contribute to fibrosarcoma cell proliferation, adhesion and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have disclosed the critical involvement of P-selectin in the facilitation of blood borne metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. P-selectin/ligand interaction often requires sialylated and fucosylated carbohydrate such as sialyl Lewis X and sialyl Lewis A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; however, P-selectin also binds to heparan sulfate, certain sulfated glycolipids and CS/DS-GAGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In previous studies we found that CS/DS-GAGs are expressed on the cell surface of murine and human breast cancer cell lines with high metastatic capacity and that they play a major role in P-selectin binding and P-selectin-mediated adhesion of cancer cells to platelets and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, variation in the abundance and function of CS/DS relative to tumor cell phenotypic properties and P-selectin binding are not well defined. It is likely that P-selectin binding to tumor cells and the functional consequences of such binding are dependent on which sulfotransferases define the relevant CS/DS and which core proteins carry the CS polysaccharide.</p><p>CS/DS expression is controlled by many enzymes in a complex biosynthetic pathway and this leads to considerable variation in structure and function. The chondroitin backbone of CS/DS-GAGs consists of repetitive disaccharide units containing D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) residues, or varying proportions of L-iduronic acid (IdoA) in place of GlcA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Major structural variability of the CS/DS chains is due to the sulfation positions in repeating disaccharide units by the site-specific activities of sulfotransferases that produce the variants CS-A, CS-B (dermatan sulfate, DS), CS-C, CS-D and CS-E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. CHST3, CHST7, CHST11, CHST12, CHST13, CHST14 and CHST15 are the enzymes that sulfate the GalNAc residues of chondroitin polymers. The expression levels of these enzymes are hypothesized to affect the production of P-selectin ligands. CHST11 and CHST13 share specificity, as they mediate 4-O sulfation of chondroitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. CHST12 and CHST14 mediate mostly 4-O sulfation of DS units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. CHST3 and CHST7 share specificity for 6-O sulfation of chondroitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. CHST15 transfers sulfate to the carbon-6 of an already 4-O sulfated GalNAc residue producing oversulfated CS-E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The relationship between the relative expression of these sulfotransferases with the expression of P-selectin-reactive CS/DS-GAGs has not been reported and is addressed in this paper.</p><p>The variation, abundance and function of CS/DS-GAGs are also affected by the expression of the PG core protein presenting them. Syndecan-1 (SDC-1), syndecan-4 (SDC-4), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) and CSPG4 are considered major pro-malignancy membrane proteins capable of carrying CS chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Among these PGs, CSPG4 exclusively carries CS chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. CSPG4 is a human homolog of Rat NG2, which is also known as High Molecular Weight Melanoma Associated Antigen and Melanoma Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This tumor-associated cell surface PG potentiates cell motility and promotes invasiveness and the metastatic potential of tumor cells in melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. CSPG4 is also linked to cancer stem cells via signaling mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Therefore, studying whether this PG interacts directly with P-selectin is of particular interest.</p><p>The expression of CSPG4 in breast cancer has been reported very recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Depending on its relative expression levels, this PG might be a major core protein presenting CS-GAGs on an aggressive subset of tumor cells, interacting with P-selectin. In the current study we investigated whether CSPG4, via its CS/DS chain can serve as a P-selectin ligand and whether expression of specific chondroitin sulfotransferases contributes to P-selectin interaction with cells. We further examined the involvement of CS-GAG chains in lung colonization by the 4T1 mammary cell line with and without enzymatic removal of CS-GAGs in a murine experimental metastasis model. Our data show for the first time that P-selectin can bind to tumor cells via CSPG4 and that <italic>CHST11 </italic>expression is linked to P-selectin-reactive cell surface CS/DS-GAGs. The results directly link CS/DS-GAGs to the metastatic spread of breast cancer. These findings have significant implications for understanding mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis, paving the way towards developing alternative strategies to treat and prevent metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Anti-CS-A mAb 2H6 was from Associates of Cape Cod/Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA, USA), anti-CSPG4 mAb 225.28 was made as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], and recombinant human P-selectin/Fc (human IgG) was from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Gene overexpression was detected in both ER-positive and ER-negative samples, but the majority of specimens with increased expression of <italic>CHST11 </italic>(seven out of eight), were HER2-neu-negative. These data suggest that despite the stromal expression of both <italic>CHST11 </italic>and <italic>CSPG4 </italic>genes the expression can be targeted specifically in aggressive tumors for therapeutic purposes. In this regard P-selectin binding to a relevant receptor on tumor cells may have profound impact on tumor cell dissemination and understanding the detail of such interaction may lead to development of novel anti-metastatic approaches.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of the <italic>CSPG4 </italic>and the <italic>CHST11 </italic>genes was detected in breast tissue samples</bold>. mRNA expression was quantified by absolute quantification and the ratio of mRNA to 18S mRNA was calculated.

P-selectin is present on activated platelets and endothelial cells while CS/DS-GAGs on the surface of breast cancer cells with high metastatic potential serve as P-selectin ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The role of P-selectin in heterotypic adhesion is a critical component determining the efficiency of tumor cell dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The study of P-selectin-reactive molecules on tumor cells is crucial for the assessment of metastatic risk and the development of possible ways of dealing with metastatic disease. Such studies are needed to ultimately reveal the functional consequences of P-selectin/ligand interaction in tumor progression, making specific links between platelets and tumor metastasis.</p><p>Our results suggest the <italic>CHST11 </italic>gene as a major player in production of such P-selectin ligands. The results using <italic>CHST11 </italic>siRNA further suggest that among the chondroitin sulfotransferases tested, <italic>CHST11 </italic>expression has a rate limiting role in constructing both CS-A chains and P-selectin ligands on MDA-MB-231 cells. This data directly links expression of the <italic>CHST11 </italic>gene to P-selectin-reactive GAGs on this cell line and has significant implications for further functional studies. CS-A is an immediate product of <italic>CHST11 </italic>expression and is considered a precursor in forming CS-E units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. P-selectin has been shown to bind to CS-E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We have also shown that exogenous CS-E inhibits P-selectin binding to cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. While we do not rule out participation of CS-E in P-selectin binding, our data do not support CS-E as the P-selectin reactive GAG unit on these cells. The combined high expression of these two genes may associate with P-selectin-reactive glycans and aggressiveness. This possibility should be investigated in future studies. However, the data indicate that the expression of the <italic>CHST11 </italic>gene in tumor cells is associated with synthesis of P-selectin ligands and a metastatic phenotype. Others have suggested a role for CS-A in tumor progression and metastasis in a melanoma model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, our data suggest that surface presentation of CS-A may be required but is not sufficient for a metastatic phenotype to occur. Besides its role in constructing CS-A, CHST11 also plays a role in chain elongation and production of more CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Chain elongation activity of CHST11 with a fine balance in the expression of other enzymes might be needed for constructing conformational epitopes. Thus, CHST11 activity may lead to larger CS polymers with multiple sequences embedded with distinct sulfation patterns resulted from activity of multiple sulfotransferases, leading to the production of conformational epitopes or highly concentrated sequences with specific reactivities. Thereby, the expression of <italic>CHST11 </italic>may correlate better with the tumor cells' aggressive phenotype than does the prevalence of any particular CS isomers.</p><p>Interestingly, our current results implicate CSPG4 in the presentation of CS moieties as P-selectin ligands. CSPG4 exclusively presents CS-GAGs, and the data described here suggest that these structures interact with P-selectin and, therefore, may contribute to distant metastasis of tumor cells. Our data indicate that P-selectin binds to CSPG4 through CS-GAGs and that CSPG4 is involved in P-selectin binding to CSPG4-expressing breast cancer cells. However, other PGs may also participate in P-selectin binding as expression of SDC-4 and NRP-1 is also higher in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MET. Lack of expression of CSPG4 in MDA-MB-468 further suggests that anti-CS-A and P-selectin binding to these cells is probably due to expression of other PGs and not CSPG4. However, because of the role of CSPG4 in signaling and tumor phenotype, we speculate that its interaction with P-selectin may lead to an exclusive tumor cell activation and consequently survival in circulation. Therefore, concerted upregulation of <italic>CSPG4 </italic>and <italic>CHST11 </italic>may induce expression of a unique molecular entity that may increase the metastatic capabilities of tumor cells. More studies are needed to understand the consequences of P-selectin binding to CS-GAGs of multiple PGs and to reveal how and at what stage of the metastatic cascade the CS-GAGs and their carrier proteins contribute to metastasis.</p><p>We have shown glycan interactions with P-selectin and the significance of P-selectin binding in metastasis of a murine mammary cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Our previous findings support the concept that CS chains promote survival in the circulation and tumor cell extravasation via P-selectin-mediated binding to platelets and endothelial cells. In the current study, the significance of the cell surface expression of CS-GAGs in a breast cancer model is established. The data demonstrate that enzymatic removal of the CS chains significantly attenuated formation of lung metastases in a highly metastatic mammary cell line. Others have shown that P-selectin ligands are critical components of heterotypic adhesion, determining the efficiency of tumor cell dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Sugahara's group demonstrated that highly sulfated CS-GAGs, in particular CS-E, are involved in metastasis of murine lung carcinoma and osteosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. However, our data suggest a role for 4-O sulfation of chondroitin in the metastatic phenotype. Moreover, the data suggest that the presence of CS/DS-GAGs may not be sufficient for a phenotype with high metastatic capacity to occur. The data emphasize a combination of the polysaccharide and a core protein as a pro-metastatic entity. Future studies are needed to understand the contribution of each PG in P-selectin mediated tumor cell behavior.</p><p>We further showed that the expression of <italic>CHST11 </italic>and <italic>CSPG4 </italic>is elevated in tumor tissues from breast cancer patients. Consistent with our data, <italic>CHST11 </italic>expression has been shown to be greater in human breast carcinoma compared to normal breast tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] and in malignant plasma cells from myeloma patients compared to normal bone-marrow plasma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].</p><p>The current research should lead to future studies of functional relationships between CS and tumor progression. Existing knowledge and further mechanistic studies might suggest CS-GAGs and their presenting PGs as targets for antimetastatic therapies. In support of work done in melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] and recent studies in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], the studies outlined here strongly suggest that CSPG4 can be an available target for immunotherapy of breast cancer. However, in order to efficiently block tumor cell dissemination by interrupting P-selectin/CS interaction, targeting any single PG does not seem enough as other PGs can probably compensate and support metastatic processes. In this regard, global targeting of specific CS isomers may be a particularly effective approach.</p><p>Breast cancer cell surface is decorated with CS-GAGs and due to tumor-specific expression patterns of chondroitin sulfotransferases and PGs, the composition and binding specificity of these polysaccharides differ from those of normal tissues. Therefore, these molecules and their interaction with P-selectin should be considered as viable targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates the significance of CS-GAGs in the lung colonization of an aggressive murine mammary cell line. The study reveals that CSPG4 can serve as a P-selectin ligand through its CS chain and that the expression of the <italic>CHST11 </italic>gene controls P-selectin reactive CS-GAGs formation. The data suggest that CS-GAGs, their biosynthetic pathway, or the core protein carrying them can be potential-targets for the development of therapeutic strategies for treatment of aggressive breast tumors. The knowledge and perspective gained from this line of research together with further mechanistic studies may pave the road to target CS-GAGs, their carrier PGs and their interaction with P-selectin as novel antimetastatic therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>18S: 18S ribosomal RNA; ANOVA: Analysis of Variance; CS: Chondroitin Sulfate; CS-GAGs: Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans; CS/DS: Chondroitin Sulfate/Dermatan Sulfate; CS/DS GAGs: Chondroitin Sulfate/Dermatan Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans; CHST3: Carbohydrate (chondroitin 6) sulfotransferase 3; CHST7: Carbohydrate (N-acetylglucosamine 6-O) sulfotransferase 7; CHST11: Carbohydrate (Chondroitin 4) Sulfotransferase 11; CHST12: Carbohydrate (Chondroitin 4) Sulfotransferase 12; CHST13; Carbohydrate (Chondroitin 4) Sulfotransferase 13; CHST14: Carbohydrate (N-acetylgalactosamine 4-O) Sulfotransferase 14; CHST15: Carbohydrate (N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O) Sulfotransferase 15; CS-A: Chondroitin Sulfate A unit; CS-E: Chondroitin Sulfate E unit; CSPG4: Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan 4; DS: Dermatan Sulfate; DS4S-1: Dermatan 4-sulfotransferase 1; ER1: Estrogen Receptor 1; GAGs: Glycosaminoglycans; GalNAc: N-acetyl-D-galactosamine; GalNAc4S-6ST: N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase; GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GlcNAc: N-acetyl-D-glucosamine; GlcA: Glucuronic acid; IdoA: Iduronic acid; mAb: monoclonal Antibody; NPR-1: Neuropilin-1; PG: Proteoglycan; qRT-PCR: Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; SDC-1: Syndecan-1; SDC-4: Syndecan-4; siRNA: short interfering RNA; UAMS: University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>BMK and TKE are named as inventors on an institutional patent application filled by UAMS that is related to the content of this manuscript.
