Thus, increased incidence of bacterial resistance to currently available antibiotics necessitates the discovery and introduction of new and effective drugs. In our earlier studies, we have discovered a potent antibacterial lead molecule from 1,3,5-triazine (first generation) and its subsequent optimization till its tenth generation results much more advanced analogue with enhanced activity and less toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>Present study deals with the advancement of novel derivatives of 1,3,5-triazines to increase its efficacy and potency to make them viable drug candidate (eleventh generation).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The synthesis of analogues was achieved by means of S<sub>N</sub>Ar reaction utilizing distinguished amines. These molecules were then subjected to antibacterial screening against pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative micro-organisms. MetaPrint2D-React from University of Cambridge, UK was utilized for the prediction of metabolites of the compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Entire set of derivatives demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity (1.56 - 25 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>-1</sup>), and in some instance found equipotent to cefixime as standard. The molecular docking study on eubacterial ribosomal decoding A site (Escherichia coli 16S rRNA A site) confirmed the stability of target compounds into the inner groove of active site by making close H-bonds with highly conserved residues, e.g. Ade38, Gua37, Ade39, and Gua40. Moreover, the most active compound 7e, in MetaPrint2D-React study was not found to be deactivated by human metabolic process, which conform the utility of designed molecules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have discovered an another novel 1,3,5-triazine analogs as potent antibacterial agent through structure-based optimization of our defined lead.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosure of interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhat</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumawat</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>UP</given-names></name><article-title>Structure-guided discovery of 1,3,5-triazine-pyrazole conjugates as antibacterial and antibiofilm agents against pathogens causing human diseases with favourable metabolic fate</article-title><source>Bioorganic &#x00026; Medicinal Chemistry Letters</source><year>2014</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>3321</fpage><lpage>3325</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.bmcl.2014.05.103</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24961639</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
