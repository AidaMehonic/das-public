So far no valid clinical or research approaches used to investigate the activity of TM in malignant conditions and infertility are available because of its unknown etiology. From clinical and laboratory studies, the existing evidence has confirmed that TM is formed by the intratubular deposits consisting of calcified central cores surrounded by multiple concentric layers of cellular debris, glycoprotein, and collagen within the seminiferous tubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, possible pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the formation of calcified central cores of TM are not yet fully understood. Recently, nano-sized bacteria-like organisms (nanobacteria) have been proven to be involved in the process of pathological calcifications and previously detected in semen samples from patients with testicular microlithiasis (TM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The terminology &#x02018;nanobacteria&#x02019; referring to nano-sized bacteria-like organisms were first discovered in a cell culture and named by Kajander and Cifcioglu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. They were self-replicating, 0.1&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in size, and had the capacity of forming calcium phosphate minerals under subsaturation levels of calcium and/or phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nanobacteria, as an emerging cause of pathological calcification, were therefore also called calcifying nanoparticles (NPs). Although there is insufficient proof that calcifying nanoparticles are living organisms, a great deal of evidence from previous studies has established a possible relationship between nanoparticles and pathological calcifications, such as aortic valve calcification, prostatic calculi, renal tubular calcification, and dental pulp stone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par22">The emergence of nanobacteria, which are nanometer-scale spherical particles capable of producing nucleate hydroxyapatite, has spurred a major controversy in the field of microbiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The absence of a fairly accurately sequenced genome for nanobacteria has led to various hypotheses of the characteristic and origin of nanobacteria. In this study, our cultured NPs successfully caused testicular inflammation, which suggested that they might be living entities.</p><p id="Par23">Human NPs have been found mainly excreted from urinary tract and may flow back into seminiferous tubules, colonize there and cause testis infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To date, NPs have been found in periodontal diseases, urolithiasis, aortic valve calcification, human arthritic synovial fluid, and demonstrated to participate in the clinical pathological process of those diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a previous study, NPs were successfully cultured from 58.8% of semen samples of patients with TM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, experimental studies on animal models focused on the uncovering of new connections between NPs and the etiopathogenesis of TM were needed.</p><p id="Par24">To <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ichacha.net/exclude.html">exclude</ext-link> the possibility of false positives of human NPs cultured from semen samples, three efforts were made in our study. Firstly, our experimental operations and testing instruments were conducted under strict aseptic conditions. Secondly, samples were cultured without fetal bovine serum, which usually contains inhibitors on apatite crystal formation, such as osteopontin, osteocalcin, and fetuin. Thirdly, the supernatants of human NPs cultures were filtered with a 0.22-&#x003bc;m minipore filter, which could effectively remove the common bacteria, mycoplasma, and fungi. In this study, human NPs were successfully cultured with serum-free RPMI-1640 from semen samples of patients with TM, which exhibited as spheroids with black coats and crystals around the bacterial body under TEM. All these results obtained from our experiments indicated that human NPs did reside in the testicular architecture of TM patients.</p><p id="Par25">Furthermore, we injected the human NPs suspension into the male Sprague-Dawley rat proximal right ductus deferens, and pathological changes of the rats resulting from NP infection in the testis tissue were observed. Our investigation demonstrated that human NPs administration caused significant histopathological alterations in testis, manifested as leukocytic infiltration in the innermost layer of sperm cells at 2&#x000a0;weeks, structurally impaired sperm cells of the innermost layer and a zone of concentrically layered collagen fibers around the NP body formed in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules at 2&#x000a0;weeks, and a well-recognized form of intratesticular calcification surrounded by cellular debris within the seminiferous tubules at 4&#x000a0;weeks. However, no significant pathological changes were observed in the controls. Although significant leukocytic infiltration changes in the innermost layer of sperm cells were also observed in the groups receiving <italic>E. coli</italic> at 2&#x000a0;weeks, no intratesticular calcification surrounded by cellular debris within the seminiferous tubules was observed after 4&#x000a0;weeks. Therefore, a model of TM phenotype was successfully reproduced in this study. Our results also confirmed that human NPs were the known agents of emerging infectious diseases and producing apatite, which agrees well with other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A possible calcification mechanism might be NP colonization in seminiferous tubules inducing an immune response, promoting inflammation development and further calcification.</p><p id="Par26">Ultrasound (US) is an effective approach for monitoring formation of calcification, which can be seen as tiny bright echoes without acoustic shadow scattered throughout the testicular parenchyma. Unfortunately, we failed to find a suitable ultrasonic probe for rats. Instead we did testis ultrastructural study at different points. TEM and SEM illustrations showed that the pathological alterations and calcification in seminiferous tubules were not homogenous. Many globoid or racket-shaped particles in cytoplasm were only observed in the NP-instilled rats and were not present in any of the controls under TEM. Moreover, the fibrils and mineral deposits developed in seminiferous tubules had different sizes and morphology under SEM. These illustrations further proved that human NPs did participate in the formation of testicular microlithiasis.</p><p id="Par27">The present study was a descriptive rather than mechanistic study. In our early experimental design, we intended to explore the formation mechanism of testicular microlithiasis by NPs, and thus chose <italic>E. coli</italic> as a control to uncover the differences in histopathological alterations. Unfortunately, we failed to observe any significant differences in terms of histological features. Further investigations on the differences of the leucocyte population by means of immunohistochemistry (IHC) between them may better define the character of NPs and their possible mechanistic role in TM pathogenesis. Therefore, more effort addressing this question is needed in our future work.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par28">The results obtained from our study suggest a potential pathogenic effect of systemic inoculation of human-derived NPs to stimulate calcification within the seminiferous tubules.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>NPs</term><def><p id="Par5">nanoparticles</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p id="Par6">scanning electron microscopy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TEM</term><def><p id="Par7">transmission electron microscopy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TM</term><def><p id="Par8">testicular microlithiasis</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Wei Liu and Dr. Peng Hui Chen for their technical and editorial assistance with this research project and manuscript preparation.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par29">This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation in China (81,000,241 and 81,471,444).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par30">All datasets on which the conclusions of the manuscript rely are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Study conception and design: XC-Land QH-Z; Acquisition of data: XC-L, XG, GS-L, BS and QH-Z; Analysis and interpretation of data: XC-L,XG and QH-Z; Drafting of manuscript: XC-L,XG and QH-Z; Critical revision: BS.
