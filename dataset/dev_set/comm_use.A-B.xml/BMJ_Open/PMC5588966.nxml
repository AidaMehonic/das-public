More accurate and streamlined staging could improve patient outcomes both by triaging to optimal therapy and decreasing the time between diagnosis and treatment.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) has been advocated as a safe, accurate and efficient &#x02018;one stop shop&#x02019; investigation that could potentially replace current complex multimodality staging strategies.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A single WB-MRI scan could not only accelerate staging but would simultaneously reduce exposure to ionising radiation, in theory reducing the risk of subsequent radiation-induced malignancies, particularly in those diagnosed at a younger age. WB-MRI however can be stressful: its duration, 45&#x02013;90&#x02009;min, is longer than standard tests &#x02014; CT takes a few seconds. MRI scanners are noisy and require full body and head immersion into a relatively narrow tube, often necessitating coils wrapped around the patient that restrict movement. Somewhere between 5% and 30% of patients experience distress associated with the anticipated and actual experience of undergoing MRI.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;9</xref> Anxiety relates to the scan experience itself as well as the result.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Severe claustrophobia can lead to premature scan termination or the need for sedation in 1%&#x02013;15% of&#x000a0;attempts,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> and distress is associated with elevated postscan anxiety,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> which can engender MRI fear or phobia,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> especially problematic in patients needing future MRI scans.</p><p>Increased physical and psychological vulnerability of patients with suspected cancer may reduce their ability to cope with a WB-MRI.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 15</xref> Cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment are still much feared despite recognition of better treatment outcomes,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref>&#x000a0;and patients may be experiencing shock, anxiety and worries about the future.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 18</xref> While two small qualitative studies have investigated general patient experience of MRI,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> there have been few descriptions of patients undergoing WB-MRI, particularly in those diagnosed with or highly suspected of having cancer.</p><p>Patient acceptability is central to the successful adoption of any new technology. Poor acceptability could reduce adherence to WB-MRI, which in turn considerably blunts the impact of the technology, even if diagnostically superior to existing tests.</p><p>Two parallel, multicentre, prospective cohort studies<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> investigating the diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of WB-MRI compared with standard pathways for newly diagnosed lung (&#x02018;Streamline-L&#x02019;) and colorectal (&#x02018;Streamline-C&#x02019;) cancer have recently been&#x000a0;completed. The aim of this study was to describe patient experience and acceptability of WB-MRI and compare with standard staging tests, in the context of lung and colorectal cancer, using interviews from patients recruited to the Streamline trials. In the trials, the WB-MRI was offered as an additional scan alongside those performed as part of standard care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>There is little existing research describing patients&#x02019; experiences of undergoing WB-MRI, and we adopted a qualitative design as this provides the flexibility to capture rich descriptions of experiences without a priori knowledge of potential responses. One-to-one interviews were completed face to face (at home or at hospital) or via the&#x000a0;telephone. Individual interviews were conducted to facilitate expression of emotions and negative experiences that may be inhibited in a group setting. For two interviews a relative was present to support translation where English was not the patient&#x02019;s first language. Patients were interviewed only once.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial and interview study recruitment</title><p>Patients were recruited to the &#x02018;Streamline&#x02019; trials from 10 English National Health Service (NHS)&#x000a0;hospitals and consented to undergo WB-MRI in addition to standard staging investigations at one of five MRI scan hospital hubs. During trial consent, patients could opt into the interview study and were contacted by psychology researchers by phone, as soon as possible after all imaging had been completed. Prior to trial consent patients were given information about cancer staging and the WB-MRI; staging was explained to patients as a process where doctors use tests to assess whether cancer has spread around the body to help decide best treatment, and&#x000a0;the trial was described as an assessment about whether the WB-MRI may be quicker or better at staging newly diagnosed cancer than standard scans. Accelerated treatment pathways meant some interviews (n=13) were undertaken after treatment had commenced. Trial inclusion/exclusion criteria are published.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</p><p>The a priori total sample size was a minimum of 50, stratified by cancer site (25 lung and 25 colorectal patients). There was flexibility to recruit beyond this number to achieve saturation, that&#x000a0;is, the point beyond which further interviews contribute little new information, although this was not needed. The first 123 trial patients were approached and 91 (74%) agreed to be interviewed. Of the 91 who agreed, 51 patients (56%) participated; we believed we had reached saturation by 50 patients and ceased interviews; however, one additional interview was subsequently completed as a patient (from the original 91 consenting patients) expressed a strong wish to share their views. Reasons patients were not interviewed included consent retracted (n=8), participation in a related questionnaire study (n=14), withdrawal from the main trial (n=12) and interview quota reached before completion of all staging imaging tests (n=6).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Conducting the interview</title><p>Interviews were conducted from March 2013 to July 2014 by two female psychology researchers (RE and AM), independent of the clinical trial team, with prior training and experience of conducting in-depth interviews with patients with cancer.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> The researchers introduced themselves as working with the doctors at the patient&#x02019;s hospital and explained that the interview was an opportunity to provide feedback about the WB-MRI and other tests the patient had had. A topic guide was developed (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>) to encourage discussion of key aspects of the staging experience, including comparisons between WB-MRI and standard investigations. This guide was reviewed after completion of the first two interviews to assess whether it needed to be modified. Topic ordering and emphasis varied depending on relevance to each patient. Open-ended questions were followed by verbal probing to elicit further clarification. Interviews lasted between 12 and 86&#x02009;min (mean 48&#x02009;min), and were recorded digitally. Participating patients were paid &#x000a3;20 plus travel expenses.<boxed-text id="B1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>Key interview topics</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>

Patients recruited to &#x02018;Streamline-L&#x02019; underwent at least a CT and PET-CT, with a proportion undergoing bronchoscopy for tissue sampling.</p><p>WB-MRI was perceived to be more challenging than standard scans : <italic>&#x0201c;I would say the most challenging of the MRI scans was the body scan&#x0201d;&#x000a0;</italic>s56 (60&#x02013;69, male, colorectal &#x02014; &#x02018;C&#x02019;), like &#x0201c;<italic>torture - medieval torture&#x0201d;&#x000a0;</italic>s12 (50&#x02013;59, male, C), while CT was described as <italic>&#x0201c;a walk in the park&#x0201d;&#x000a0;</italic>s42 (60&#x02013;69, male, C) and <italic>&#x0201c;very simple&#x0201d;&#x000a0;</italic>s35 (50&#x02013;59, female, lung &#x02014; &#x02018;L&#x02019;).

However the CT and PET-CT were not without challenges: for example some commented on the intravenous contrast administered during the CT scan, <italic>&#x0201c;you feel a bit, you know, woozy, funny, &#x02026;and it did make me feel slightly off&#x0201d;</italic> s63 (&#x0003c;50, male, C), and the perceived &#x02018;invasiveness&#x02019; of the radiation exposure associated with CT and PET-CT, &#x0201c;<italic>all that radiation dye in my system and everything&#x02026;And it just disturbed me.

<italic>&#x0201c;I was going to have a sort of panic attack and have to be taken out of the machine</italic>&#x02026;<italic>this claustrophobia, the feeling of being&#x02026;trapped, really&#x0201d;</italic> s12&#x000a0;(50&#x02013;59, male, C). Worry and fear were also prompted by the novelty of the experience: <italic>&#x0201c;the oppression comes from the unknown&#x0201d;&#x000a0;</italic>s45 (70&#x02013;79, male, C). Dealing with feelings of panic and fear was a challenge in itself and needed effort to overcome: &#x0201c;<italic>when I first laid down in the scan I was frightened<italic>&#x02026;</italic>I was trying to put it [fear] out of my head and think positively&#x0201d;</italic> s79 (60&#x02013;69, female, C). In comparison, &#x0201c;<italic>they [CT and PET-CT] were slightly more easier to relax in that environment, not that I didn&#x02019;t relax in the MRI scan too, it&#x02019;s just that it took a bit more sort of power, more energy if you like, to relax&#x0201d;</italic> s41 (60&#x02013;69, male, L).</p></sec><sec id="s3b5"><title>Cancer context</title><p>The WB-MRI was perceived to have the potential to either suggest a cancer diagnosis or reveal additional findings associated with a poorer prognosis and treatment implications: <italic>&#x0201c;I was lying in there and I was thinking, what if they say it&#x02019;s cancer? Then, what?&#x0201d;</italic> s54 (&#x0003c;50, female, L) and <italic>&#x0201c;whether they&#x02019;d find <italic>&#x02026;</italic> it has gone everywhere and you know nothing you can do, I suppose that was the main worry&#x0201d;</italic> s60 (60&#x02013;69, female, L). One patient had a dilemma whether to go ahead with the scan because of the possibility that its findings might mean he was&#x000a0;not offered treatment: &#x0201c;<italic>I was of two minds about the trial scan because I didn&#x02019;t want the trial scan to say the cancer&#x02019;s spread and they wouldn&#x02019;t operate.&#x0201d;</italic> s30 (50&#x02013;59, male, L). However another patient reported relief when the scan confirmed that initial tumours were localised: &#x0201c;<italic>my biggest fear, I know I&#x02019;ve got the cancer in the bowels. I&#x02019;ve seen it myself on the colonoscopy. And I was worried that they might, it might just disguise I&#x02019;ve got other cancers. So when he said straight away, there was nothing else and I feel relieved&#x0201d;</italic> s45 (70&#x02013;79, male, C). There was also appreciation of having the WB-MRI because it did reveal spread: &#x0201c;<italic>The MRI actually showed up even more of what&#x02019;s going on with me and I think if I hadn&#x02019;t had it, they would<italic>&#x02026;</italic>we still wouldn&#x02019;t know.

The existential threat posed by a cancer diagnosis may have influenced how physical characteristics of the scan were&#x000a0;interpreted; one patient described the enclosed experience as <italic>&#x0201c;It's like being in a coffin. You know, I did think that. It&#x02019;s like being in a coffin. But I wasn&#x02019;t. You just have to think that<italic>&#x02026;</italic> Because if you&#x02019;ve got something really, really bad, it would be like being in a coffin. Just like thinking, &#x02018;my God.

And I would have thought that could be quite scary&#x0201d;</italic> s16 (60&#x02013;69, male, C); at this point the patient, recently diagnosed with colorectal cancer, became tearful. Another patient interpreted MRI sounds to indicate the presence of pathology: <italic>&#x0201c;And then you&#x02019;ll hear all these noises coming through you, so you wonder<italic>&#x02026;</italic>, I thought, if the machine is clicking on, maybe something is wrong there with me&#x0201d;</italic> s13 (60&#x02013;69, female, C).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Explaining differences in experiences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>)</title><sec id="s3c1"><title>Cancer type</title><p>Physical symptoms reported more frequently by those recruited to &#x02018;Streamline-L&#x02019; were associated with discomfort&#x000a0;&#x02014; &#x0201c;<italic>I found lying flat on my back, yes, very uncomfortable<italic>&#x02026;</italic> I was coping okay for about 20, 25&#x02009;min and then that&#x02019;s when this pressure or aching or uncomfortable feeling on my chest began to kick in&#x0201d;&#x000a0;</italic>s30 (50&#x02013;59, male, L)&#x000a0;&#x02014; and difficulty with breath holding, &#x0201c;<italic>they had to make me do it a few times because I couldn&#x02019;t hold it for the length of time they wanted me to <italic>&#x02026;</italic> I&#x02019;ve got COPD, whether that made it worse, I don&#x02019;t know&#x0201d;</italic> s58 (60&#x02013;69, male, L).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A model illustrating the factors that influence a patient&#x02019;s whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) experience.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016391f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3c2"><title>Existing musculoskeletal problems</title><p>Sometimes these made the WB-MRI more uncomfortable, but not for all: <italic>&#x0201c;I do suffer a bit from back pain<italic>&#x02026;</italic> My back started to sort of be pretty uncomfortable&#x0201d;</italic> s42 (60&#x02013;69, male, C), and <italic>&#x0201c;I was worried about my neck being uncomfortable <italic>&#x02026;</italic> because of arthritis but they managed to sort me out and then I managed to last the hour&#x0201d;</italic>&#x000a0;s18 (60&#x02013;69, male, C).</p></sec><sec id="s3c3"><title>Mental health comorbidities</title><p>One patient with prior anxiety found the scan difficult, describing their anxiety as causing feelings of claustrophobia: &#x0201c;<italic>I'm not claustrophobic.

In contrast, another participant (s8: 60&#x02013;69, male, C) who knew he suffered from severe claustrophobia requested a sedative and completed the scan with relative ease. Work experiences meant some patients were used to confined spaces and/or loud noises: <italic>&#x0201c;it doesn&#x02019;t bother me.

Vicarious experiences were sources of knowledge for patients without prior personal experience, and influenced expectations, sometimes reassuring: &#x0201c;<italic>I have a few friends and relatives<italic>&#x02026;</italic> they have already done MRI, so I had something from them, this [is not] painful or anything like that.&#x0201d;</italic> s19 (60&#x02013;69, male, C); sometimes contrary to their own eventual experience, <italic>&#x0201c;it was not as intimidating as I thought<italic>&#x02026;</italic> I had heard people talking about going in to an MRI scanner, and they were telling me how nervous they were, and how they hated it<italic>&#x02026;</italic> And when I saw it, I thought, &#x02018;That's okay&#x02019;&#x0201d;</italic> s18 (60&#x02013;69, male, C).</p></sec><sec id="s3c5"><title>Staff contact</title><p>Staff supported patients with verbal reassurance, information provision, as well as making them physically comfortable.

Patients recognised that WB-MRI was different from other scans, although the extent of the challenge varied considerably. The majority completed WB-MRI with just four patients requesting premature termination; all were prepared to attempt future WB-MRI. Patients adopted a variety of coping strategies,&#x000a0;and these centred on the physical and emotional responses experienced during scanning, as well as focusing on beliefs that bolstered motivation to complete the scan.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are only two other comparable qualitative studies of patients&#x02019; experiences of MRI.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> In common with our study the enclosed space, noise, physical discomfort and duration were identified as challenging, and the need for staff support was also highlighted. The importance of a &#x02018;trustful dialogue&#x02019; between radiographer and patients, to facilitate coping strategies,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> resonates with comments made by patients in our study.</p><p>Noise and confinement are the most frequently cited negative aspects of MRI in quantitative work published over the last 20 years.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 12</xref> Other studies identify additional factors increasing the likelihood of premature scan termination, including acquisition position (head first, and/or prone); age and gender (middle age or female); prior experience (first scan or prior negative experience); and comorbidity (pain, anxiety).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 13 26 27</xref> Our results concur with some of these findings; we found some evidence that comorbidity (eg, anxiety and physical symptoms) increased scan challenge, although there were contrary examples where musculoskeletal patients did not experience anticipated discomfort after adjustments were made by staff. Unlike others studies (eg,&#x000a0;refs&#x000a0;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 14</xref>) prior experience (positive or negative) generally increased coping ability.</p><p>Our study adds to the existing literature. Our patient cohort was highly suspected or just diagnosed with cancer, and we were able to elicit influences of this on their experience of MRI. Furthermore the specific scan type under investigation (WB-MRI) differs from simpler MRI scans such as knees and spine, based on its longer duration and need for receiver coils to cover the whole body. Patients described how the WB-MRI had the potential to reveal a cancer diagnosis or additional metastatic disease, with treatment implications. This caused anxiety and a dilemma as to whether to have the scan. However some patients also described relief and gratitude for having the scan either when it found no additional cancer or indeed when it diagnosed additional metastatic disease. The perceived length of the scan, together with its title of &#x02018;whole body&#x02019;, may have added to patients perceptions about its ability to influence their treatment and prognosis. The WB-MRI scanner was likened to a coffin or sarcophagus, and it is possible that these observations were more emotive because the patients were contemplating a life-threatening diagnosis. Carlsson and Carlsson<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reported greater fear when MRI was used to confirm serious illness. WB-MRI for cancer staging comes at a point when patients are likely to be emotionally vulnerable, stretching coping resources for challenging medical procedures. However, while the implications of scanning patients with comorbidities and emotional vulnerability should be acknowledged, it is important to note that most completed the WB-MRI.</p><p>Our study suggests that good staff communication could reduce anxiety and boost coping strategies by acting as a source of distraction, motivation and emotional reassurance. The varied experiences encountered underline the need for staff interaction to be tailored. Advanced staff training to build rapport can reduce MRI non-completion rates and increase patient satisfaction.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> A recent UK survey suggests that while strategies are in place to help reduce MRI-related anxiety (commonly written leaflets, verbal prescan information, music during scanning, dedicated staff support), these are not optimised yet, with resource restrictions a potential barrier to implementation.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The generalisability of our results may be limited. WB-MRI was performed within the context of a research trial and some patients declined participation citing claustrophobia. Acceptability of WB-MRI may be lower than our study suggests. However the patients were from a wide age range and deprivation levels, and were interviewed from a number of different hospitals. As a result, a diverse spread of experiences were documented and included some who ultimately were unable to tolerate scanning.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Our study confirms that WB-MRI can be a challenging experience and that staff support is important in modifying scan-related stress. Our study also highlights that patient experience is varied, and for the most part the scan was tolerated, suggesting WB-MRI could potentially replace existing modalities, assuming adequate diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness. Experience of WB-MRI reflects the success of coping strategies adopted by patients and the quality of support they receive. Further research would facilitate understanding of the interrelationship between patients&#x02019; experiences, the effectiveness of their coping strategies and of the support received from staff, such that patients and clinicians can benefit maximally from the diagnostic potential of WB-MRI.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e299" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016391.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e301" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016391.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of the Cancer Research UK and UCL Clinical Trials Centre.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> ST, SJ, SH, AMM, NN, AO, AR and AM designed the clinical trial protocol, which includes this study.
