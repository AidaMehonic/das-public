The purpose of this study was to assess the current practice patterns of FBs and to focus on the use of propofol, the education of the proceduralist, and the involvement of anaesthesiologists during FB.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 299 pulmonologists. Only respondents who were active physicians in adult respiratory medicine performing FB were subsequently analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The response rate was 78&#x000a0;% and 27,149 FB in the previous 12&#x000a0;months were analysed. The overall sedation-related morbidity rate was 0.02&#x000a0;% and mortality was 7/100&#x02019;000 FB. Sedation was used in 95&#x000a0;% of bronchoscopies. The main drugs used for PSA were propofol (77&#x000a0;%) and midazolam (46&#x000a0;%). In 84&#x000a0;% of PSAs propofol was used without the attendance of an anaesthesiologist.

Sedatives or anaesthetics are a prerequisite for procedural tolerance and patient satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and thus they are widely used during the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In general they are considered safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and in the absence of contraindications expert panels explicitly recommend the use of moderate sedation in patients undergoing FB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>FB is now increasingly performed outside the operating theatre and outside high output tertiary care centres, which has gone hand in hand with a shift in procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Historically, anesthesiologists have been predominantly in charge of PSA, but a growing number of proceduralists are managing sedation and anesthesia during FB. This has created debate about bronchoscopist-administered vs. anesthesiologist-administered sedation during bronchoscopy.</p><p>Because common complications during FB (e.g. respiratory depression, cardiovascular instability) and one-half of deaths reported during FB are related to sedation, the quality of education, experience and skills of members of the bronchoscopy team are instrumental in maintaining a good safety profile for FB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There is now emerging evidence that proceduralist-administered sedation is feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and cost effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, it is unclear to what extent pulmonologists are now in charge of PSA, what their educational background is, and what the current sedation practice entails.</p><p>More than 10&#x000a0;years ago, studies suggested the practice of PSA during FB varied greatly for each physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite the wide use of FB among pulmonologists there is little standardisation in practice and the choice of sedative agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. An increasing body of evidence suggests that propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is an eligible anaesthetic agent of choice for PSA during FB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Propofol is a potent hypnotic used for sedation in FB with a fast onset and high degree of controllability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It provokes at least similar sedation, amnesia, and patient tolerance compared with a combination of benzodiazepines and opiates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, there is no antagonist available and the therapeutic window is narrow. Therefore, the use of non-anaesthesiologist administered propofol (NAAP) remains controversial in several countries due to safety concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In Switzerland, propofol is approved for use without the strict legal restrictions applying in some other countries enabling pulmonologists to use it under the umbrella of local guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In contrast to other procedures e.g. gastroenterological endoscopy it is unclear to what extent and under which circumstances propofol is used in PSA during FB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was: (i) to survey a representative sample of Swiss pulmonologists; (ii) to assess the current practice patterns of FBs; (iii) to focus on the use of propofol and monitoring techniques.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>A structured anonymous and standardised questionnaire was sent to all members of the Swiss Society of Pulmonology (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;299) in their local language using the publicly available database.

Non-responders were sent a paper-version of the questionnaire. The year of board certification as specialist/consultant was used as a surrogate for length of experience with FB. FB performed by a fellow under direct supervision of a specialist/consultant were not included. The questionnaire addressed the following areas: number of procedures performed during the previous 12&#x000a0;months; sedation rates; frequently used drugs for PSA; personnel involved in PSA and route of drug delivery; use of supplemental oxygen and pharyngeal anaesthesia; frequency and type of monitoring; availability of emergency resuscitative measures; training of personnel involved in PSA; and the incidence of complications attributed to sedation during the previous 12&#x000a0;months. The following questions were conditional on the use of propofol (either regularly or occasionally): usage pattern for propofol (administration or combination scheme); cumulative number of PSA carried out with propofol; and the self-reported number of adverse incidents necessitating emergency intervention during sedation with propofol. In addition, responders were asked to provide detailed qualitative feedback. Replies were anonymous and non-traceable and IP addresses (i.e. computer-numbers) were recorded to identify and delete duplicate records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous data were summarised as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD or median (25<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;75<sup>th</sup> percentiles) and categorical data summarized using percentages.

However, the results may also have important clinical implications with regard to future education and bronchoscopists in other countries who would like to change their PSA patterns (e.g. towards the usage of propofol).</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Safety results</title><p>The reported mortality and complication rate during FB is generally low but comparable to other studies in this field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The data suggests that FB is generally a safe procedure associated with only few complications and, surprisingly, the reported incidence of apnoeas in our study was lower compared to gastro-intestinal endoscopies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A possible explanation for the diverging complication rates to other specialities lies in the fact that pulmonologists tend to have more knowledge about airway management and breathing problems. Perhaps, this could also be due to the fact that (compared to Swiss gastroenterologists) the pulmonologists were faced for the first time with a survey of this kind.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>The use of propofol</title><p>The results confirm a trend towards propofol as an agent of choice. In 1989 propofol was approved in Switzerland and initially used around 2000 by non-anaesthesiologists for gastro-intestinal endoscopy and FB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Propofol has emerged as an appealing agent of choice: it is better tolerated by patients with a faster recovery time and a quicker return to baseline mental status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The novelty of the drug and individual familiarity with pre-existing regimens are also most likely to be the reasons for a lower proportion of late-career pulmonologists using propofol. Thus, the use of propofol is predicted to rise in the future (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). It is important to keep in mind that in Switzerland, propofol is approved for use without the strict legal limitations that exist in some other countries. In particular, non-anaesthesiologists are allowed to use propofol provided they have had an adequate training for its use. For example at the University Hospital Zurich in agreement with the Institute of Anaesthesiology the following recommendations are given: First, the proceduralist should not be the same person who is administering the drug. Second, the patient should be adequately monitored (at least oxygen saturation and blood pressure). Lastly, the proceduralist and the drug administering person should be capable of airway management and emergency ventilation. The rate of proceduralist-administered propofol sedation of 84&#x000a0;% was also very high and, to our knowledge, the highest reported rate so far. However, worldwide the use of NAAP remains controversial since propofol lacks an available antagonist and its narrow therapeutic window between no sedation and deep sedation with apnoea warrants a formally trained physician. Gastroenterologists in Switzerland have shown that NAAP is safe, especially for gastro-intestinal endoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition, other studies have shown that nurse-administered propofol is a feasible and safe sedative during FB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, the cooperation between anaesthesiologists and bronchoscopists remains crucial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Of those physicians who used propofol, 43&#x000a0;% reported that they were actively supported or trained by an anaesthesiologist at the time of the introduction of the drug. This is a very similar rate to Swiss gastroenterologists performing endoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In general, our data suggest that propofol administration represents a safe sedation technique that can be performed by a non-anaesthesiologist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This aspect is particularly relevant since the advantages of propofol e.g. fast onset and high degree of controllability makes it a drug of choice for PSA during FB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>The study has some significant clinical implications. First, the data gives insight into a health-care system where the majority of pulmonologists are using propofol for PSA during FB. It shows that NAAP is feasible and can work on a large scale without an increased rate of serious adverse events. Second, the study raises awareness that these practice patterns clearly result in augmented educational demands for pulmonologists (specifically, training in NAAP) which should be taken into account. It is vital that a bronchoscopist can facilitate every aspect of PSA during FB, especially adequate and efficient therapy of complications.</p><p>The overwhelming part of qualitative feedback provided in this study concerned the education of pulmonologists in PSA and uncertainties regarding the competences of proceduralists. Only 50&#x000a0;% of the respondents stated that &#x0201c;systematic basic education&#x0201d; in the field of PSA was part of their education. This is in line with other countries (e.g. Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]) and provides evidence for professional societies and certifying agencies to move from a volume-based certification system (which often implies &#x0201c;learning by doing&#x0201d; [Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>]) to a standardised skill acquisition and knowledge-based competency assessment, as already recommended by expert panels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Currently, the European guidelines state minimum numbers of supervised procedures required for a trainee to be deemed competent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A meta-analysis has shown that systematic FB-training programs (ideally before exposure to patients) are effective in terms of skills and behaviours in comparison with no intervention and they can also be used to harmonise PSA in the field of FB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The skillset of future interventional pulmonologists comprises the independent performance of PSA during FB. This skill should not depend on potential rotations e.g. former rotations in the intensive care unit but rather should be systematically trained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Limitations and future studies</title><p>A limitation of this study is that the data are self-reported and do not originate from registers. However, by anonymising the questionnaire we sought to minimise the underestimation of &#x0201c;unpleasant&#x0201d; data and encourage participants to accurately state their complication numbers. On the other hand, because of the anonymity, no further data beyond our questionnaire (e.g. circumstances of the two reported deaths, FB indications, patient data etc.) could be retrieved. The fact that the response rate of this study (78&#x000a0;%) is higher than comparable studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and that answers were retrieved from all 15 major hospitals (five university hospitals and ten cantonal hospitals) in Switzerland the authors feel confident that the presented data are reliable and represent current clinical practice. Additionally, the observed mortality rates are comparable to those from other countries, a fact which promotes confidence in the report of yet &#x0201c;unpleasant data&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Under the assumption that sedation practice does not differ among pulmonologists in each centre the &#x0201c;unknown&#x0201d; sedation practice of the 22&#x000a0;% non-responders is likely to have a negligible effect on the presented data. Finally, the study represents only cross-sectional PSA practice patterns. Experience in gastroenterological studies has also taught us that sedation practice is constantly evolving and that the picture of current sedation patterns can change drastically within a relatively short time period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although we have tried to anticipate the future usage patterns of propofol (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), there is a need for further evaluations (including electronic databases) in this field to accurately assess shifts in PSA practice patterns. Since the data is representative for Switzerland only, further surveys in other countries are needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This representative survey of Swiss pulmonologists demonstrates that the majority of Swiss pulmonologists are in charge of PSA of their patients and describes in detail the current sedation and monitoring practice. Propofol was by far the most commonly administered drug during FB in adults and the dominance in PSA of this drug is likely to increase in the future. This study highlights the need of education and systematic training of pulmonologists for PSA during FB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>FB, flexible bronchoscopies; IQR, interquartile range; NAAP, non-anaesthesiologist administered propofol; PSA, procedural sedation and analgesia; SD, standard deviation</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The contribution of the members of the Swiss Society for Pulmonology who responded to the questionnaires is highly appreciated.
