Meanwhile, microbes resistant to these antibiotics continuously emerge over time and spread all over the world. This situation motivated scientists to search for new naturally occurring bacterial agents that may be potential antibiotics. Reptiles including alligators and crocodiles were subjected to an exploration of the antibiotic properties from their body.</p><p>Bacteria and fungi coexist with other living organisms. Despite such an ecological phenomenon, pathogenic microbial invasion into hosts does not normally take place, as the host has the defense mechanisms that counteract infection. One of such systems is based on non-specific immunity, which comprises a wide variety of peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] with potent antimicrobial properties.</p><p>A kind of crocodiles (<italic>Crocodylus siamensis</italic>), the Siamese crocodile is a critically endangered species of freshwater crocodiles, originally distributed in most of South East Asia. Crocodilians live with opportunistic bacterial infection but normally suffer no adverse effects. They are not totally immune to microbial infection, but their resistance thereto is remarkably effective. The immune system of crocodilians has not been well characterized, but there are several reports that describe the antimicrobial efficacy of alligator serum towards bacteria, viruses, and amoeba [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Merchant <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] recently proposed that the complement systems of alligators are effective in killing bacteria. More recently, leukocyte extract of the American alligator (<italic>Alligator mississippiensis</italic>) showed a broad spectrum of antibiotic properties on bacteria, fungi, and viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide on peripheral leukocytes were also investigated in the American alligator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we have examined the crude and purified plasma obtained from the Siamese crocodile for the antibacterial activity against clinically isolated, human pathogenic bacterial strains and the related reference strains, which will be of great importance in medical industry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasma samples</title><p>Crocodiles (<italic>Crocodylus siamensis</italic>) were captured and housed at the local Sriracha Moda Farm, Chon Buri, Thailand.

However, only a few reports were found in one of the freshwater Siamese crocodiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the present study, the Siamese crocodile plasma was effective as an antibacterial agent against the following six reference strains and the four pathogens both Gram-negative and Gram-positive species: <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> ATCC 11778, <italic>Ecsherichia coli. coli</italic> O157:H7, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> non01, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853, <italic>Streptococcus epidermidis</italic> ATCC 12228, <italic>Streptococcus epidermidis</italic> clinical isolate 1, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> clinical isolate 1, <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> clinical isolate 1, and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> clinical isolate 1. All the bacterial species used in this study are known to be human pathogens. It is obvious that the Siamese crocodile plasma has a broad band of spectrum in antibacterial activities. The results demonstrated that the antibacterial activities were highly effective as an antibacterial agent against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, consistent with the study in American alligator serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Antimicrobial peptides have been isolated from a broad variety of phylogenetically diverse organisms and separated into a variety of classes based on their chemical structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The classes of the peptides showed different kinds of mechanisms on antimicrobial action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the present study, the antibacterial mechanism of the crude Siamese crocodile plasma on the cell surface, including cell walls and membranes, of <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> ATCC 11778, a reference strain was studied by SEM. The results obtained suggested that an antibacterial compound probably penetrates progressively into the cytoplasmic space, perturbing and damaging bacterial cell surface, as found in the previous report of Preecharram <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], who isolated an antibacterial compound called crocosin from the <italic>Crocodylus siamensis</italic> plasma using RP-HPLC and found that the compound exhibited an antibacterial activity toward <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. These results in the actions of the antimicrobial compounds correspond with the actions of the antimicrobial peptides such as bactenecin 5, bactenecin 7, poly-L-lysine, cecropin B, LL-37 PGYa, melittin, Hecate-1 and SMAP-29 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Most antibacterial peptides found thus far, such as those from amphibian skin, magaingnin and dermaseptin are known to exert their antimicrobial activity by permeabilizing the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The antibacterial compound isolated by Preecharram <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] has a similar mechanism on action to those of the antibacterial peptides reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] in disrupting the cell surface. However, all antimicrobial peptides have several factors, in common, which are able to interact with the negatively charged phospholipids in the membranes of microbes and are also amphipathic, so that the compounds interact with the interior hydrophobic portions of the membranes and form pores in the membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>However, there was no report about the cytotoxicity of the compound administered to cells of a macrophage-like cell, RAW 264.7. The present data is the first report. The MTT assay, to assess the cytotoxicity of the Siamese crocodile plasma administered to cells of macrophage RAW 264.7, is an assay of metabolic competence based on assessment of mitochondrial performance by colorimetrical measuring of the conversion of yellow tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to the purple formazan derivative by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase in viable cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the present study, the wells incubated with the crocodile plasma showed light yellow color, whereas the wells incubated as negative controls showed deep purple. From the MTT assay mentioned above, the Siamese crocodile plasma was not cytotoxic to the cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the crude and purified plasma from <italic>Crocodylus siamensis</italic> showed significantly antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria and reference strains by damage cell membrane of target bacterial. From the MTT assay, the Siamese crocodile plasma was not cytotoxic to the cells. On the basis of the results obtained above, the plasma extracted from <italic>Crocodylus siamensis</italic> was known to have a significant use as a clinical antimicrobial agent. So the subsequent studies are required to focus on the purification and characterization of the agent responsible for the antimicrobial activities including the anti-inflammatory activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JK and SP carried out the study and wrote the manuscript.
