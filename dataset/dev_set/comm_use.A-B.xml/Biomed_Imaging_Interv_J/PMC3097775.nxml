The median time to progression was 11.5 months. The median overall survival was 27 months. The most severe hematologic toxicity occurred during IC was grade3-4 neutropenia (40%).

Surgery and/or radiotherapy is the main definitive of therapy in patients with locally advanced SCCHN. Induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy is a promising treatment in this group of patients.</p><p>Up to 30-50% of chemonaive locally advanced SCCHN patients treated with cisplatin-5FU (PF) have been reported to achieve a complete response rate at primary sites, with an overall response rate of 70-88%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] The main toxicities associated with PF-induction therapy are hematological, digestive and mucositis with the majority of events being grade 1 or 2.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] Despite the high overall response rates, the low CR rates at primary sites and the high rate of locoregional recurrence in patients with extensive lymph node disease have been disappointing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]</p><p>The results of many phase III trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] show that adding taxane (T) to the standard cisplatin and 5-FU regimen improved the overall survival rate and led to better organ preservation over a PF regimen. A phase II study combining paclitaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin (TIP) to treat recurrent and metastatic SCCHN produced a high overall response rates (54%) including prolonged duration of CR and encouraging one-and two-year median survival rates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]</p><p>As an induction chemotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer, a phase II study combining paclitaxel, ifosfamide and carboplatin resulted in a high overall response rate of approximately 80%.

This single-center, open-label, non-randomized phase II study evaluated tumor response of induction chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin for locally advanced head and neck cancer, as well as the therapeutic efficacy on overall survival and time to disease progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>Patients were eligible if they had histologically confirmed SCCHN, at least one bidimensionally measurable lesion, aged 18-70 years, stage III or IV (AJCC staging 2002) disease without distant metastases, an ECOG performance status of 0 to1, and adequate bone marrow/hepatic/and renal function. Patients with primary sites in the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, nasal cavity and paranasal sinus were eligible. Patients were excluded from the study if they had primary sites of the nasopharynx or salivary glands. Patients who had been treated for a previous SCCHN, had severe intercurrent medical illness, or known peripheral neuropathy were also excluded from the study.

Patients then received further treatment with only local therapy, and 4 of 10 (40%) still had no evidence of disease at the time of their analysis. One factor that contributed to the poorer outcome than prior induction studies was the tumor subsite. In our study, the primary site of the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity were much more prevalent than in the other studies (40% versus 0-1%). We knew that the nature of this disease was disappointing, especially in advanced stages, and all 40% of our patients with paranasal sinus cancer were in stage IV of the disease.</p><p>There were no therapy-related deaths. Administration of induction TIP regimen was associated with grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in only 3% and 1%, respectively. The administration of subsequent concurrent chemoradiotherapy was not compromised. We found only a 1% instance of grade 4 neutropenia during CCRT. Radiation induced mucositis and pharyngitis were common side effects but no one delayed the schedule of radiotherapy.</p><p>In summary, we observed a 63% overall response rate of two cycles of induction chemotherapy and as high as 90% after CCRT, and the 27-month median survival with TIP regimen, establishing it as an effective regimen with high but manageable toxicities for locally advanced head and neck cancer. However, the inferior survival outcome to prior studies emphasizes the importance of patient selection according to performance status and primary tumor site to achieve a favorable outcome. Aggressive nutritional support should be considered in patients receiving this regimen, to improve acute palliation and to maximize the delivery of combined-modality therapy. Patients with poor performance status or primary tumors involving the paranasal sinus/nasal cavity may not be good candidates.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
