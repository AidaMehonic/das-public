The molecular dynamics that occur at the NSD boundary relative to adjacent OV cells is not well defined. The <italic>Tbx1</italic> transcription factor gene expression pattern is complementary to the NSD, and inactivation results in expansion of the NSD and expression of the Notch ligand, Jag1 mapping, in part of the NSD. To shed light on the role of <italic>Jag1</italic> in NSD development, as well as to test whether <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> might genetically interact to regulate this process, we inactivated <italic>Jag1</italic> within the <italic>Tbx1</italic> expression domain using a knock-in <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele. We observed an enlarged neurogenic domain marked by a synergistic increase in expression of <italic>NeuroD</italic> and other proneural transcription factor genes in double <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> conditional loss-of-function embryos. We noted that neuroblasts preferentially expanded across the medial-lateral axis and that an increase in cell proliferation could not account for this expansion, suggesting that there was a change in cell fate. We also found that inactivation of <italic>Jag1</italic> with <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> resulted in failed development of the cristae and semicircular canals, as well as notably fewer hair cells in the ventral epithelium of the inner ear rudiment when inactivated on a <italic>Tbx1</italic> null background, compared to <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mutant embryos. We propose that loss of expression of <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> within the <italic>Tbx1</italic> expression domain tips the balance of cell fates in the NSD, resulting in an overproduction of neuroblasts at the expense of non-neural cells within the OV.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="precis"><p><bold>Summary:</bold> Normal dosages of <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> are required to maintain a proper balance of cell types within the neurosensory domain of the otic vesicle to form the inner ear.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>Otic vesicle</kwd><kwd>Inner ear</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>Tbx1</kwd><kwd>Jag1</kwd><kwd>Neurosensory</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC05186</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The inner ear forms from the otic vesicle (OV), which is a closed, continuous epithelium consisting of cells that will differentiate to form specialized cell types (<xref rid="BIO027359C3" ref-type="bibr">Bok et al., 2007</xref>). The T-box transcription factor gene, <italic>Tbx1</italic>, plays a major role in the OV for inner ear morphogenesis. <italic>Tbx1</italic> is expressed in the posterior-lateral OV, mostly complementary to the region that forms the cochleovestibular ganglion (CVG) (<xref rid="BIO027359C16" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C25" ref-type="bibr">Raft et al., 2004</xref>). When <italic>Tbx1</italic> is inactivated in the mouse, the CVG is duplicated in size, marked by an expansion in expression of <italic>Atonal</italic>-related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proneural transcription factors <italic>Neurogenin1</italic> (<italic>Ngn1</italic>; also known as <italic>Neurog1</italic>) and <italic>NeuroD</italic> (<italic>Neurod1</italic>), in the neurogenic domain (<xref rid="BIO027359C25" ref-type="bibr">Raft et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the cochlea and vestibular system do not develop (<xref rid="BIO027359C28" ref-type="bibr">Vitelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C25" ref-type="bibr">Raft et al., 2004</xref>). However, failure of otic epithelial cells to proliferate normally in <italic>Tbx1</italic> null mice may render it difficult to identify the range of its specific requirements (<xref rid="BIO027359C29" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Overexpression (<xref rid="BIO027359C11" ref-type="bibr">Funke et al., 2001</xref>) or constitutive expression of <italic>Tbx1</italic> (<xref rid="BIO027359C9" ref-type="bibr">Freyer et al., 2013</xref>), on the other hand, has the opposite effect for neurogenesis, meaning that the neurogenic domain is reduced in area (<xref rid="BIO027359C9" ref-type="bibr">Freyer et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to this defect, the utricle and the saccule, containing hair cells derived from prosensory patches during early development, do not form. This suggests that <italic>Tbx1</italic> may restrict neurogenesis and sensorigenesis. We are interested in understanding the mechanism for this, so we considered other genes that are required for these processes.</p><p>The Notch ligand, Jagged1 (Jag1), and group B Sox SRY-related HMG box transcription factor (Sox2) are broadly co-expressed in the ventral region of the OV. Within these expression domains, exists a subdomain known as the neurosensory domain (NSD), the cells of which have the potential to differentiate into neurons, hair cells or support cells (<xref rid="BIO027359C1" ref-type="bibr">Adam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C5" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C6" ref-type="bibr">Daudet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C7" ref-type="bibr">Fekete and Wu, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C14" ref-type="bibr">Kiernan et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="BIO027359C13" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C17" ref-type="bibr">Morsli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C19" ref-type="bibr">Neves et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C24" ref-type="bibr">Raft and Groves, 2014</xref>). Mouse genetic studies show that inactivation of <italic>Jag1</italic> results in failed development of prosensory patches early in development, and a reduction in the size of the neurogenic zone of the CVG (<xref rid="BIO027359C14" ref-type="bibr">Kiernan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that it may be required for neurosensory competence or maintenance. Sox2 expression is maintained by <italic>Jag1</italic> and is also required for neurosensory specification (<xref rid="BIO027359C14" ref-type="bibr">Kiernan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C19" ref-type="bibr">Neves et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>). Tbx1 appears to function in a complementary manner to Jag1.</p><p>Little is known about the cellular and molecular dynamic requirements of cells in the NSD for proper inner ear development. Notch pathway genes have been implicated in tissue boundary formation during development in various contexts. Since loss of <italic>Tbx1</italic> results in an expansion of the CVG and inactivation of <italic>Jag1</italic> results in a somewhat smaller CVG (<xref rid="BIO027359C14" ref-type="bibr">Kiernan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>), we wanted to test whether the two genes might act antagonistically in the NSD for inner ear development. In this study, we utilized <italic>Tbx1</italic> (<xref rid="BIO027359C33" ref-type="bibr">Huynh et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>Jag1</italic> (<xref rid="BIO027359C14" ref-type="bibr">Kiernan et al., 2006</xref>) conditional loss-of-function mouse mutants to evaluate their functions in the NSD, and found a surprising novel function in neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression of Tbx1 and Jag1 around the NSD</title><p>Both <italic>Jag1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> are markers of the NSD-containing cells required for neurogenesis and sensorigenesis (<xref rid="BIO027359C24" ref-type="bibr">Raft and Groves, 2014</xref>). We performed immunofluorescence studies to determine where and when Tbx1, Jag1 and Sox2 are expressed with respect to each other and to the NSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). At embryonic day (E) 9.5, Tbx1 was broadly expressed in the posterolateral wall of the OV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A, b-c&#x02032;; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.027359.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>). As expected, Jag1and Sox2 proteins were expressed in a similar pattern to one another. Expression of the two was complementary to Tbx1 in the anterior domain, while there was some overlap in expression with Tbx1 in the posterior lateral OV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A, a-c&#x02032;). By E10.5, expression of all three genes became more restricted within their respective complementary domains, such that Jag1 and Sox2 had less overlap in expression with Tbx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A, d-f; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.027359.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>). The complementary expression patterns between Tbx1 and Sox2/Jag1 and known loss-of-function phenotypes (<xref rid="BIO027359C25" ref-type="bibr">Raft et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C23" ref-type="bibr">Puligilla et al., 2010</xref>) suggest that there might be an antagonistic relationship between them. We decided to focus on evaluating the relationship between Tbx1 and Jag1 in more detail, since there appeared to be a sharper border between Jag1 and Tbx1, than Sox2 and Tbx1, expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A), suggesting that the two may interact genetically to form an important boundary within the OV. Another reason to focus our study on <italic>Jag1</italic> is that <italic>Jag1</italic> has been shown to function upstream of <italic>Sox2</italic> during inner ear development (<xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C19" ref-type="bibr">Neves et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, <italic>Notch1</italic> has been shown to function downstream of <italic>Tbx1</italic> during neurogenesis in the OV (<xref rid="BIO027359C29" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2007</xref>), providing additional rationale to further study its ligand, <italic>Jag1</italic>, which had never been linked to <italic>Tbx1</italic> up until this point.
<fig id="BIO027359F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p><bold>NSD gene expression in wild-type and <italic>Tbx1</italic> null embryos.</bold> (A) Immunofluorescence was performed using antibodies to Jag1, Tbx1 and Sox2 on tissue sections from mouse embryos at E9.5 (a-c&#x02032;) and E10.5 (d-f&#x02032;). Jag1 and Sox2 are expressed broadly in the otic epithelium at E9.5, overlapping with Tbx1 expression in the PVL OV, but are largely complementary. By E10.5, Jag1 and Sox2 expression is mainly restricted to the anterior ventral lateral and posterior medial OV, with less overlap with Tbx1 expression, which is restricted to the posterior dorsal lateral OV. (B) Immunofluorescence was performed using antibodies to Jag1, Tbx1, Isl1 and NeuroD, as indicated (g-i&#x02032;). Jag1 is expressed in the NSD, where neuroblasts expressing both Isl1 (g) and NeuroD (h) are derived. Tbx1 is expressed complementary to Jag1 (i,i&#x02032;), as well as NeuroD (h), at the same border. The diagram below depicts the planes of sections used. (C) Schematic summarizing the wild-type expression of the genes examined in B, with respect to domains. (D) Immunofluorescence for Jag1 (red) on transverse sections in embryos at E9.5 and E10.5 was performed. The sections progress from the anterior to posterior domains of the OV. At E9.5, Jag1 expression expands in both the medial and lateral domain (white brackets), while at E10.5, Jag1 expression expands in the lateral domain (white brackets). (E) Immunofluorescence for Jag1 in <italic>Tbx1 GOF</italic> and littermate control embryos showing a shift in the expression from lateral (white arrow) to medial (yellow arrow) in anterior sections (p&#x02032;,q&#x02032;).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="biolopen-6-027359-g1"/></fig>
</p><p>At this point, in order to evaluate Tbx1 and Jag1 expression with respect to regions of neurogenesis, the expression of Jag1, Tbx1, Isl1, and NeuroD were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B). Jag1 was expressed in the region where neuroblasts expressing both Isl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B, g) and NeuroD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B, h) are derived, while Tbx1 was expressed in a largely complementary manner to these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B, i,i&#x02032;). This indicates that Tbx1 is excluded from the neurogenic domain within the NSD, marked by overlapping expression of Jag1 and NeuroD. A schematic of expression patterns is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>C, showing the expression patterns of these genes, with respect to one another and the NSD border.</p><p>We also wanted to determine what effect loss or gain of <italic>Tbx1</italic> would have on Jag1 expression and, indirectly, the NSD. At E9.5, <italic>Jag1</italic> expression expanded anteriorly and posteriorly on the medial and lateral walls of the OV when <italic>Tbx1</italic> was globally inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D, j&#x02032;,k&#x02032;,l&#x02032;). By E10.5, <italic>Jag1</italic> expression in wild-type embryos became restricted mostly to the posteromedial OV, with small regions of expression in the anterolateral wall of the OV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D, m,n,o). When <italic>Tbx1</italic> was inactivated, <italic>Jag1</italic> expression again expanded across the medial-lateral axis of the posterior OV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D, m&#x02032;,n&#x02032;,o&#x02032;). The expansion in <italic>Jag1</italic> expression into the posterior OV correlated with the region of ectopic neurogenesis in <italic>Tbx1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> OVs that has been previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B) (<xref rid="BIO027359C25" ref-type="bibr">Raft et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C29" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). We also examined the expression of <italic>Jag1</italic> in <italic>Tbx1 GOF</italic> (<italic>Pax2-Cre/+; Tbx1-GFP/+</italic>) (<xref rid="BIO027359C9" ref-type="bibr">Freyer et al., 2013</xref>) embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>E), and found that the expression domain shifted from the anteroventral lateral to anteroventral medial OV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>E, p,p&#x02032;). In control embryos, Jag1 is expressed in the medial OV in more posterior sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>E, q,r), whereas in in anterior sections, Jag1 expression is exclusively lateral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>E, p). In contrast, in <italic>Tbx1 GOF</italic> embryos, Jag1 expression is almost exclusively medial throughout the OV, with significantly more coverage of the medial wall of the OV compared to controls, particularly in anterior sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>E, p&#x02032;,q&#x02032;,r&#x02032;). These findings indicate a change in the position of the medial-lateral border and shift of the NSD. Of note, cells within the anteroventral lateral region of the OV contribute to the CVG and utricle (<xref rid="BIO027359C7" ref-type="bibr">Fekete and Wu, 2002</xref>), the cells of which are derived from a shared lineage within the NSD (<xref rid="BIO027359C26" ref-type="bibr">Raft et al., 2007</xref>) We further asked whether there was mutual antagonism between <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic>, by examining Tbx1 expression in <italic>Jag1</italic> null mice in the OV. There was some decrease in the area of Tbx1 expression, although this loss is likely secondary to the reduction in size of the OV (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.027359.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</uri>). The position of the expression domain with respect to the OV appeared unaltered. These findings suggest that there is a unidirectional pathway by which <italic>Tbx1</italic> restricts the Jag1 expression and the size and location of the NSD.</p><p>Next, we performed cell lineage tracing of <italic>Tbx1</italic> using a <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mouse line (<xref rid="BIO027359C33" ref-type="bibr">Huynh et al., 2007</xref>) crossed with a GFP reporter line (Batista-Brito et al., 2009) in order to map the overlap between the <italic>Tbx1</italic> lineage and Jag1 expression to know where <italic>Jag1</italic> might be getting inactivated. We found that Jag1 partially colocalized with the <italic>Tbx1</italic> cell lineage, marked by GFP in mostly the posterior ventral lateral (PVL) OV at E10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A), but broadened to include the posterior medial domain at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B). There was less overlap in the anteroventral region, adjacent to the CVG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A-C). On a separate note, there is another distinct <italic>Tbx1</italic> lineage within the mesoderm surrounding the OV as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B). The OV from the E10.5 embryo shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B was used for serial section 3D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>C). The purpose was to better visualize the areas of overlap between Jag1 and the <italic>Tbx1</italic> cell lineage. This clarified that Jag1 expression occurred mostly at the border of the <italic>Tbx1</italic> lineage, with overlap occurring primarily in the PVL and posterior ventral medial (PVM) domains, which contribute to the lateral SCC and, in part, the saccule and cochlea, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>C) (<xref rid="BIO027359C7" ref-type="bibr">Fekete and Wu, 2002</xref>). A very clear border between the <italic>Tbx1</italic> lineage and <italic>Jag1</italic> expression can been seen at the dorsal-ventral (white arrow) and medial-lateral (black arrow) axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>C). We also performed <italic>Tbx1</italic> lineage tracing when <italic>Tbx1</italic> was homozygously inactivated, in conjunction with antibody staining for NeuroD. Interestingly, this revealed that while the ectopic CVG that forms in <italic>Tbx1</italic> null embryos is composed largely of cells derived from the <italic>Tbx1</italic> cell lineage, a number of neuroblasts positive for NeuroD are GFP-negative (GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), suggesting they are not derived from the <italic>Tbx1</italic> lineage and could indicate nonautonomous roles (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.027359.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S3</uri>). Previous findings that Jag1-Notch1 signaling plays a role in CVG formation (<xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>) and loss of <italic>Tbx1</italic> affects aNotch expression (<xref rid="BIO027359C29" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2007</xref>), provide a reasonable basis for speculating that <italic>Tbx1</italic> may regulate CVG formation nonautonomously by affecting this cell signaling pathway. Another point worth noting is that it has been previously shown (and confirmed in this report) that the CVG and distal ganglia fuse in <italic>Tbx1</italic> null embryos (<xref rid="BIO027359C29" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2007</xref>).

Thus, some GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in this experiment may also derive from epibranchial ganglia.

Note that <italic>Jag1</italic> expression was also reduced in the pharyngeal apparatus, where the two genes also overlap in expression, but not in regions where they are not co-expressed, such as the forelimb (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.027359.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S4</uri>). It is also important to note that resulting <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Jag1<sup>flox/+</sup></italic> conditional double heterozygous embryos also have reduced dosage of <italic>Tbx1</italic> since the <italic>Cre</italic> is knocked into the endogenous <italic>Tbx1</italic> locus, producing a functionally null allele (<xref rid="BIO027359C33" ref-type="bibr">Huynh et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To test whether CVG development would be affected in resulting double mutants, RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was performed for <italic>NeuroD</italic> at E10 and E10.5. At E10, <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> embryos exhibited a small, but visible, increase in <italic>NeuroD</italic> expression along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the ventral OV, compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A). Double heterozygous <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Jag1<sup>flox/+</sup></italic> embryos at E10, compared to <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> embryos, exhibited a greater expansion in <italic>NeuroD</italic> expression. This expansion was along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the anterior OV, with the CVG rudiment appearing larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A). We then inactivated both alleles of <italic>Jag1</italic> by generating <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Jag1<sup>flox/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos. These embryos exhibited an even greater expansion in <italic>NeuroD</italic> expression along the D-V axis and posterior ventral domain of the OV. A large increase of <italic>NeuroD</italic> expression occurred in <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos. In these embryos, an ectopic ganglion formed in the posterior domain of the OV, at the same stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A,B). Further, the anterior and posterior ectopic CVG became fused, along with cranial ganglia VII and IX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A,B). This phenotype has previously been described (<xref rid="BIO027359C25" ref-type="bibr">Raft et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C29" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2007</xref>) and is shown for the sake of comparison. When one or both copies of <italic>Jag1</italic> were inactivated on a <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup></italic> background, <italic>NeuroD</italic> expression expanded to an even greater degree than in <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos at both E10 and E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A,B).

The histological sections further illustrated the expansion of the <italic>NeuroD</italic> domain, as well as expansion of distal IXth and Xth ganglia, and fusion of these three ganglia with the Vth ganglion, in the case of the double homozygous mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B, yellow arrow). Further, the area of NeuroD expression was quantified in tissue sections for both E10 and E10.5 mutant embryos (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.027359.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S6A</uri>). Indeed, we found that the area of expression was significantly greater in double mutant embryos in than in <italic>Tbx1</italic> single mutant embryos at both stages. This expansion appeared to be dose-dependent, as decreasing dosage of <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> correlated with increasing expression levels of <italic>NeuroD</italic>.

</p><p>Because whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization is somewhat limited in the resolution of expression it provides, we also performed immunofluorescence studies on tissue sections using an antibody to NeuroD on double conditional null mutant embryos (<italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup>;Jag1<sup>flox/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup>;Jag1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>) and <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>C). We used this to quantify the number of NeuroD positive (NeuroD<sup>+</sup>) cells within the OV epithelium alone, as well as the total number of NeuroD<sup>+</sup> cells within the epithelium, plus cells that have delaminated to form the CVG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>D,E) at E9.5. Because the epibranchial ganglia appear to fuse with the CVG in these mutants, it is important that we quantify cells within the OV epithelium alone, in order to isolate the otic epithelial-specific function of Jag1 and Tbx1 from potential function in other cranial placodes or ganglia. More distal ganglia can be easily distinguished as discrete patches of cells in many of the transverse sections; therefore, we are confident that a majority of the cells present in the VIIIth ganglion/CVG region are composed of otic epithelial cells. However, a fraction of those ventral-most cells may likely originate from the epibranchial ganglia, and so, two distinct quantifications are needed. The mean total number of NeuroD<sup>+</sup> cells from both analyses were significantly greater in double mutant OVs as compared to <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup></italic> OVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>D). We additionally quantified neuroblast numbers in the CVG in double conditional null mutant embryos (<italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup>;Jag1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>) and <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos using an antibody to Isl1 on serial sections at E10.5 (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.027359.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S6B</uri>). Similarly, we found that the mean total number of Isl1<sup>+</sup> cells from both analyses were significantly greater in double mutants as compared to <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mutants (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.027359.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S6B</uri>). Interestingly, we noticed from both NeuroD and Isl1 immunofluorescence experiments that neuroblasts preferentially expanded into the lateral domain of the CVG in double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>C; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.027359.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S6B</uri>).</p><p>One explanation for the expansion of the NSD region in <italic>Tbx1;Jag1</italic> double conditional null mutant embryos, is that there is an increase in cell proliferation of neural progenitor cells. To address this, we performed immunofluorescence on tissue sections at E9.5 using antibodies to phospho-Histone H3 (pHH3) to mark proliferating cells, and NeuroD to mark the neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>D). We calculated the mitotic index of proliferating neuroblasts from the OV by dividing the total number of proliferating cells (pHH3<sup>+</sup>) that colocalized with NeuroD by the total number of NeuroD<sup>+</sup> cells, and these numbers were averaged per OV. We found that the mitotic indices were not higher, but in fact they were lower in both <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup>;Jag1<sup>flox/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup>;Jag1<sup>floxflox</sup></italic> embryos compared to <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>A,B). These differences were statistically significant: <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 for both. We also compared the average number of pHH3<sup>+</sup> cells that colocalized with NeuroD per ear and found consistent results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>B). Thus, proliferation alone cannot account for the changes in neural precursor expression observed. We also noted that the OV was noticeably smaller in <italic>Tbx1;Jag1</italic> double conditional null mutant embryos compared to <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos, and wondered if this could be due to a reduction in the number of non-neural proliferating cells. Indeed, we found that there was a significant reduction (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 for both double mutants) in the average number of proliferating cells that were negative for NeuroD expression within the OV at E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>C). One possibility is that the smaller OV arises due to a change in cell fate from non-neural to neural and, subsequently, cells delaminated from the OV to form the CVG. These findings were somewhat surprising since inactivation of <italic>Jag1</italic> is associated with a decrease in CVG size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>) (<xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, our findings show that the expansion of the neurogenic region observed in <italic>Tbx1</italic>;<italic>Jag1</italic> double mutant embryos is not merely additive, nor synthetic, but rather it is due to a synergistic expansion of neuroblasts when both genes are lost at the NSD border. Taken together, these findings suggest that <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> genetically interact at the NSD border to regulate neurosensory patterning across the medial-lateral axis of the OV, and that loss of both genes brings about an overproduction of neuroblasts contributing to the CVG that is not caused by increased cell proliferation.

This co-occurred with increased proneural gene expression in the OV, unaccompanied by changes in cell proliferation. Based upon all this, we created a model that summarizes our findings, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F7">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>. Despite the fact that loss of <italic>Jag1</italic> alone resulted in a smaller CVG than in wild-type embryos, when one or both alleles of <italic>Jag1</italic> was inactivated with <italic>Tbx1</italic>, more neuroblasts were present than in global <italic>Tbx1</italic> null mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F7">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>). This revealed that <italic>Jag1</italic> plays a complex role in neural development that is unmasked when inactivated within the <italic>Tbx1</italic> expression domain together with <italic>Tbx1</italic>, and that <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> may genetically interact in this process.

In wild-type embryos at E10-10.5, Tbx1 is expressed at the NSD border marked by overlapping expression of neurogenic genes (grey stripes) and Jag1/Sox2 (red) in the anteroventral OV. This NSD is positioned adjacent to the developing CVG, marked by NeuroD and Isl1 expression (grey), and contributes to it some of its progenitor cells fated to become neurons. When <italic>Tbx1</italic> is homozygously inactivated (Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup>), Jag1 expression is expanded throughout the OV, disrupting the NSD border. The CVG also expands into the posterior and lateral domain in <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (or <italic>Tbx1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) OVs. When <italic>Jag1</italic> is inactivated (<italic>Jag1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>), the Tbx1 expression domain is unchanged, and the CVG is significantly smaller in size.

</p><p>In this work, we found that inactivation of <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> within the <italic>Tbx1</italic> expression domain particularly affected the M-L boundary, in addition to the already disrupted A-P boundary seen in <italic>Tbx1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> OVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO027359F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>) (<xref rid="BIO027359C25" ref-type="bibr">Raft et al., 2004</xref>). Relevant to these findings, <xref rid="BIO027359C27" ref-type="bibr">Sapede et al. (2012)</xref> performed cell lineage analysis in zebrafish that identified a population of common progenitors that can give rise to neurons and hair cells that reside in the posteromedial part of the OV. In this study, we found <italic>Jag1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic>, required for sensorigenesis and neurogenesis, to be expressed in the posteromedial region of the OV, forming a border with lateral-expressed <italic>Tbx1</italic> at the NSD border. One interpretation of these data is that regulation of the M-L boundary is important for the maintenance of this domain and <italic>Jag1</italic>, along with <italic>Sox2</italic>, serves as marker of this common pool of cells, the fate of which is restricted by <italic>Tbx1</italic>.</p><p><italic>Tbx1</italic> fate mapping in <italic>Tbx1</italic> null mutant embryos also provided evidence suggesting that <italic>Tbx1</italic> may regulate CVG formation in a cell-nonautonomous (as well as cell-autonomous) manner. Based upon these findings, we further speculate that there might be an intermediate gene or genes between <italic>Tbx1</italic> and master proneural transcription factors <italic>NeuroD</italic> and <italic>Ngn1</italic>, one of which may be <italic>Jag1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The role of <italic>Jag1</italic> in NSD development</title><p>Our data suggest that <italic>Tbx1</italic> restricts neurosensory cell formation by acting at the NSD border of the OV either directly or indirectly, restricting <italic>Jag1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> expression. Previous findings in chick show that overexpression of human <italic>JAG1</italic> in the OV induces expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> in a Notch-dependent manner (<xref rid="BIO027359C19" ref-type="bibr">Neves et al., 2011</xref>), but that this only occurs for specification of the sensory patches. This study concluded that Sox2 establishes early neurosensory competence<italic>,</italic> which is independent of <italic>Jag1</italic> (<xref rid="BIO027359C19" ref-type="bibr">Neves et al., 2011</xref>). While this is the situation in chick, we speculate that in mouse, <italic>Jag1</italic> plays a role in the specification or maintenance of the fate of cell subtypes within the NSD and not just the sensory patches. Mouse studies showed that <italic>Jag1</italic> is required for the specification of sensory precursors and a subset of neural precursors (<xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>). This supports the hypothesis that <italic>Jag1</italic> plays a role in NSD (<xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings with respect to <italic>Tbx1</italic> also support a new possible role of <italic>Jag1</italic> in the NSD. Furthermore, our studies show that <italic>Jag1</italic> expression may be broader in the mouse OV than in chick and more closely resemble <italic>Sox2</italic> expression (<xref rid="BIO027359C19" ref-type="bibr">Neves et al., 2011</xref>). If the expression of <italic>Jag1</italic> in mouse more closely follows that of <italic>Sox2</italic>, this could indicate that, like <italic>Sox2</italic>, it plays a role in the development of the NSD. Finally, studies in mouse also suggest that the clonal population of progenitors that can give rise to neurons and hair cells may consist of a larger pool of cells than in chick (<xref rid="BIO027359C10" ref-type="bibr">Fritzsch et al., 2006</xref>). If this is the case, regulation of this cell population may necessitate a larger network of genes, such as <italic>Tbx1</italic>. While these are all plausible hypotheses, it is also possible that the differences we see in mouse and chick are due to differences in experimental strategy. Since <italic>Jag1</italic> was overexpressed in chick studies and inactivated in mouse studies, it is possible that <italic>Jag1</italic> is required, but not sufficient, for the development of the NSD.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title><italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> may be required to maintain a balance of cell types within the NSD</title><p>Loss of <italic>Tbx1</italic> may affect neurosensory precursor cell fate via <italic>Jag1</italic>, as evidenced by the further expansion of proneural gene expression when <italic>Jag1</italic> is concomitantly inactivated.

Additional inactivation of <italic>Jag1</italic> may enhance this switch, based on our findings of a synergistic expansion in proneural gene expression in the OV, as well as failure of cristae and some hair cells to form properly at later stages, in <italic>Tbx1;Jag1</italic> compound mutants. We cannot exclude the possibility that nonsensory cells may also change their fate to form neuroblasts, as the semicircular canals and ampullae also do not fully form in <italic>Tbx1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Jag1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mutant inner ears.</p><p>Expansion in the neuroblast population observed in the compound mutant embryos appears contradictory to the perceived role of <italic>Jag1</italic> in neurosensory development; however, Notch1 is known to have contrasting roles during neurogenesis and sensorigenesis (<xref rid="BIO027359C1" ref-type="bibr">Adam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C6" ref-type="bibr">Daudet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="BIO027359C22" ref-type="bibr">Petrovic et al., 2014</xref>), making the interpretation of such experiments complex. One potential explanation for our findings is that <italic>Jag1</italic> may define which cells within the NSD become sensory or neural by repressing neural fate within the boundary cells where it is co-expressed with <italic>Tbx1</italic>. Outside this domain and perhaps earlier in development, <italic>Jag1</italic> may play a role in neurosensory competence together with <italic>Sox2.</italic> This may explain why both the CVG and sensory organs are hypoplastic when <italic>Jag1</italic> is globally inactivated (<xref rid="BIO027359C21" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we suggest that <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> function in opposing pathways during NSD development, but we speculate that they can also repress neural differentiation within the otic epithelium by acting similarly on common downstream factors.</p><p>One of the main strengths of this study is that we had optimal <italic>Cre</italic> alleles to inactivate <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> in the same expression domains. This allowed us to discover an interaction between the two genes in neurosensory patterning in which loss of <italic>Jag1</italic> enhances the effect of loss of <italic>Tbx1</italic> in restricting neurogenesis. We performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of many molecular markers but could not observe a difference in the pattern of expression between the <italic>Tbx1</italic> loss-of-function mutant and the double <italic>Tbx1;Jag1</italic> loss-of-function mutant embryos. This is one of the limitations in the study, and we believe this is due to the choice of genes evaluated or lack of resolution of <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization methods we used. To determine the mechanism for the <italic>Tbx1;Jag1</italic> interaction and to gain further insights into cell fate changes in the NSD, we suggest that unbiased genome wide expression profiling approaches are required.
