Excess light can lead to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can damage cellular components such as lipids, proteins and DNA. Mainly at photosystem (PS) I but also at PSII, electron transfer reactions to molecular oxygen causes the production of superoxide anion radicals (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and hydroxyl radicals (OH<sup>.</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. At PSII, triplet chlorophyll formation and the interaction with molecular oxygen stimulates the formation of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Singlet oxygen was shown to contribute significantly to the ROS-induced cellular damage during high light stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and consequently plant and algae have evolved efficient protection mechanisms to prevent the formation of this ROS. Some of these protection mechanisms can be detected as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of maximal chlorophyll fluorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Short and long term acclimation processes like state transition (qT) or adjustment of PS stoichiometry help to prevent overreduction of the photosynthetic electron transport chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The energy-dependent quenching (qE) of excess light involves a &#x00394;pH-induced activation of the xanthophyll cycle in which a violaxanthin de-epoxidase converts violaxanthin (V) into antheraxanthin (A) and zeaxanthin (Z) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Increased levels of these xanthophylls together with the protonation of specific pigment-binding antenna proteins cause a conformational change of PSII into a high quenching state where excess light energy is dissipated as heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Additionally, zeaxanthin is an efficient <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>quencher and increased levels of this xanthophyll after exposure to high light conditions might reduce damage to membrane lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recently, two LHCSR3 genes have been found to be involved in NPQ in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii </italic>indicating that other unidentified components might function in photoprotection and prevention of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>formation in photosynthetic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Singlet oxygen can damage the cell but it has also been found to play an important role in retrograde signaling through the specific activation of nuclear genes by plastid signals. Singlet oxygen produced in the chloroplast of the conditional <italic>fluorescent </italic>(<italic>flu</italic>) mutant was shown to stimulate the expression of a set of genes which was different from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>induced genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, O<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>exhibited an antagonizing effect on <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-induced gene expression in <italic>flu </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In a suppressor screen for the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-induced programmed cell death response in <italic>flu </italic>mutants, two thylakoid-localized proteins, EXECUTER1 (EX1) and EXECUTER2 (EX2), were identified which are involved in the regulation of the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated genetic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, the response to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>has been studied using either specific exogenous photosensitizers like rose bengal (RB) or neutral red (NR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or in strains lacking some <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>protective mechanisms like the xanthophyll-deficient mutant <italic>npq1 lor1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As found in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the response of the Chlamydomonas <italic>HSP70A </italic>gene to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>could be distinguished from the response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>by different reporter constructs and was attributed to separate promoter regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the glutathione peroxidase homologous gene <italic>GPXH/GPX5 </italic>of <italic>C. reinhardtii </italic>was strongly induced by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>but to a much lower extent by other ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. During high light stress, <italic>GPXH </italic>expression is strongly induced by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>by transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and various regulatory elements in the promoter were required for induction by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The GPXH protein is predicted to be dual-targeted to the cytoplasm and the chloroplast, and its peroxidase activity with plastidial thioredoxin indicates a role in oxidative stress response of the chloroplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Even though <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>can function as a signal to activate nuclear gene expression, our knowledge of how the formation of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>is controlled in photosynthetic organisms and which components are involved in the signal transduction from the plastid to the nucleus is still far from complete. Membrane lipids are primary targets of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, and oxidized fatty acids could function as signaling intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, experiments with carotenoid-depleted cultures indicated that in <italic>C. reinhardtii </italic>the sensor for <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>is not a lipophilic compound in the thylakoid membrane but probably is located in the aqueous phase of the chloroplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In an effort to identify components that affect the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>induced genetic response in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, we performed a mutant screen using a <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-specific <italic>GPXH </italic>reporter construct. Mutants with altered <italic>GPXH </italic>expression were isolated and characterized genetically and physiologically.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of mutants with altered <italic>GPXH </italic>expression</title><p>The expression of the <italic>GPXH </italic>gene is strongly induced by the increased production of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>in the chloroplast.

To identify the first class of mutants, the induction of the endogenous <italic>GPXH </italic>gene was measured in the six <italic>gid </italic>mutants exposed to NR. Unfortunately, all <italic>gid </italic>mutants retained full induction of the <italic>GPXH </italic>wild-type gene (data not shown). For the 32 <italic>gox </italic>mutants, a secondary screen was performed to reduce the number of strains for <italic>GPXH </italic>expression analysis. Based on the knowledge that <italic>GPXH </italic>overexpression increases the resistance of <italic>C. reinhardtii </italic>to chemicals enhancing ROS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the mutants were exposed to the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-producing photosensitizers RB and NR at ML conditions or the O<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup>-producing chemicals metronidazole (MZ) and methyl viologen (MV) and the organic tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH) under low light intensity (LL, 15 &#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). One group of mutants with 13 members was more resistant to t-BOOH compared to wild-type, and many but not all of these mutants were also resistant to NR and RB (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Furthermore, all strains were tested for their tolerance to high light intensities (HL, 500 &#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) resulting in the identification of 11 HL-sensitive clones. This phenotype was often combined with sensitivity to RB, NR, MZ or MV. A third group of mutants (12 clones) showed no or only very weak changes in tolerance to oxidative stress.

Indeed, a much stronger stimulation of <italic>GPXH </italic>expression compared to wild-type could be detected in more than half of the mutants, resulting in a stronger correlation (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.48) between <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>formation and <italic>GPXH </italic>expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>Increased levels of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>in <italic>gox </italic>mutants are a consequence of either increased generation or lowered detoxification of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>.

Pigment analysis of the 20 <italic>gox </italic>mutants acclimated to the same LL or HL intensity as for NPQ measurements revealed only small changes in pigment contents of few strains. Lutein was not altered in LL and only slightly higher in three mutants in HL conditions compared to the wild-type strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Similarly, &#x003b1;-tocopherol was not strongly affected in LL condition, except for 14H8, but was significantly reduced in 7 mutants after exposure to HL for 24 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). For only one strain, 18F6, higher levels of &#x003b1;-tocopherol than in wild-type were detected under HL conditions, and this correlated with increased lutein and zeaxanthin levels in this mutant. Despite the important role of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin in photoprotection and prevention of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>generation, only moderate changes of these xanthophylls were detected in the mutants compared to the wild-type. Only one mutant (18G9) had a significantly reduced de-epoxidation of xanthophylls during HL exposure showing that this process seems still to be functional in all mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Nevertheless, when grown in LL, five mutants had significantly reduced de-epoxidation states whereas other mutants had rather increased levels of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>GPXH </italic>expression and singlet oxygen production negatively correlate with the xanthophyll de-epoxidation state</title><p>In order to analyze the relationship of all the parameters measured in the 20 <italic>gox </italic>mutants, linear correlation factors were calculated for every possible combination of parameters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

Both parameters also negatively correlated with antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin levels, especially in LL-grown cultures. Thus, when comparing <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production at HL and xanthophyll levels at LL it was striking that all the mutants but one (14C11) had a high de-epoxidation state of xanthophylls or increased <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production compared to wild-type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This effect was less pronounced when <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production was compared with de-epoxidation at HL because strongly stimulated de-epoxidation reduced the relative differences between the clones.

These analyses revealed that one mutant (14H8) behaved differently from all other mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Even though 14H8 was originally screened for high <italic>GPXH</italic>-<italic>ARS </italic>expression and was found to be HL sensitive, it did not show any stimulated <italic>GPXH </italic>expression or <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production at HL intensities. All other mutants were divided into two major groups (I and II) mainly based on the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll pool. Group I had lower levels of antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin at LL than wild-type and most of these mutants showed high <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production and increased <italic>GPXH </italic>expression. They could be further subdivided into two groups, where strain 18F6 and 18G9 belonged to one group (IB) with stimulated NPQ in LL conditions and no changes in &#x003b1;-tocopherol levels under any light intensity.

In the other subgroup (IIB) only two mutants (35H11 and 15B10) had significant <italic>GPXH </italic>overexpression and higher <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production and except for lower &#x003b1;-tocopherol levels in HL for some mutants, little differences compared to wild-type were detected for most parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>No mutants with deficient <italic>GPXH </italic>induction</title><p>Screening for mutants with altered <italic>GPXH </italic>expression resulted in the isolation of several high <italic>GPXH </italic>expression mutants but no strain with deficient or strongly reduced <italic>GPXH </italic>induction by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>could be isolated. With a total number of 5500 UV-mutagenized clones tested we assume that the coverage of mutations in the genome should be high enough to hit at least one component of a putative <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>signaling cascade with a loss-of-function mutation. The relatively high UV dose resulting in the survival of only 0.4 to 2% of the cells and the fact that during segregation analyses at least two out of five <italic>gox </italic>mutants contained two mutations affecting the phenotype suggested a high mutation density in the screened population. Still, a second mutant screen for suppressor mutants of <italic>GPXH </italic>overexpression in strain 21B4 was performed using an additional plasmid containing the <italic>GPXH </italic>promoter in front of the nitrate reductase gene (data not shown). This enabled a direct selection for reduced expression under low light conditions by selecting for chlorate-sensitive clones. Out of a total number of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells surviving UV mutagenesis, 1060 clones were chlorate resistant, and of those, 15 clones also had low induction (&#x0003c; 2 fold) of the <italic>GPXH</italic>-<italic>ARS </italic>reporter construct by NR. However, all of these clones showed normal induction of the wild-type <italic>GPXH </italic>gene, indicating that under these screening conditions no <italic>gid </italic>mutants can be isolated. The conclusion that in strain 21B4 a constant increased <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production is responsible for high <italic>GPXH </italic>expression might explain why no <italic>GPXH </italic>induction deficient mutants could be isolated, because <italic>GPXH </italic>might be essential for defense against <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage. This can be excluded for the original mutant screen because selection against light-sensitive mutants during the recovery phase after mutagenesis was prevented by growing the 5500 clones in the dark. Furthermore, none of the clones was light sensitive under ML conditions during the induction tests. Thus, even though steps were taken to minimize a negative selection against <italic>gid </italic>mutants, we cannot exclude that a functional <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>response of the <italic>GPXH </italic>and maybe other genes is essential for <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. On the other hand, it is also possible that several redundant signaling pathways form a complex network to activate <italic>GPXH </italic>expression, thereby hampering the isolation of <italic>gid </italic>mutants. Finally, it still might be that more dark-grown mutagenized clones had to be tested to find the desired mutants. A similar screen to isolate <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>responsive mutants in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>resulted in the identification of at least three mutants deficient in the upregulation of different <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-induced genes in the conditional <italic>flu </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-signaling seems to have different cellular functions in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, at least in seedlings, where it is part of a programmed cell death response and in <italic>C. reinhardtii </italic>where it seems to be involved in response to cytotoxic environmental stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>GPXH </italic>overexpression and correlation with singlet oxygen production, NPQ and pigment levels</title><p>In contrast to the lack of <italic>gid </italic>mutants, many <italic>gox </italic>mutants with a stimulated expression of the <italic>GPXH </italic>wild-type gene, especially under HL intensities, could be isolated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The light intensity-dependent increase of <italic>GPXH </italic>overexpression and the sensitivity to HL conditions indicated that in several mutants <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>formation might be enhanced and cause a photooxidative stress. Indeed, increased <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>formation was measured in all but one HL-sensitive as well as many HL-resistant <italic>gox </italic>mutants (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), which nicely correlated with <italic>GPXH </italic>expression under HL conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This indicates that in most or even all <italic>gox </italic>mutants, <italic>GPXH </italic>overexpression seems not to be caused by a constitutively active signal transduction pathway but by the increased production of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>under the light conditions tested. The poor correlation between <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production and <italic>GPXH </italic>expression under ML (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), the clustering in at least five phenotypic distinct groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) and the fact that three of the mutants (18F6, 21B4 and 35H11) have been mapped to different linkage groups (data not shown) indicates that mutations in different nuclear genes are responsible for the increased <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production in the various mutants.</p><p>Singlet oxygen formation in photosynthetic organisms is caused by the conversion of excited chlorophylls into the triplet state and the reaction with molecular oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The organisms try to minimize this process by regulating the excitation pressure on the PSII reaction center chlorophylls, optimizing the electron flow in the photosynthetic electron transport chain and quenching chlorophyll triplet states and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Thus, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>accumulation can result from either stimulated production, e.g. due to enhanced triplet chlorophyll formation, or lowered detoxification of the ROS due to defects in some light-induced protection mechanisms. Such a defect in protection mechanisms could be the reason for high <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>formation in most of the group I mutants of cluster analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) having reduced zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin levels which correlates with high <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). A well characterized mutants with reduced xanthophyll levels and defects in photoprotection is the <italic>npq1 lor1 </italic>double mutant lacking the carotenoids zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin and lutein. Similar to many mutants of group I, this mutant exhibits increased ROS production, <italic>GPXH </italic>expression and sensitivity upon HL but not LL illumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, comparison of <italic>npq1 </italic>and <italic>npq1 lor1 </italic>showed that reduced levels of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin but normal levels of other carotenoids like lutein would probably not cause a very strong phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, reduced efficiency of more than one protection mechanism might be required to achieve increased <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>accumulation. Indeed, five of the group I mutants with reduced xanthophyll levels (13H11, 14B5, 14C11, 21E2, 22D1) also showed lowered &#x003b1;-tocopherol levels under LL and/or HL conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, group IA). Furthermore, levels of other components of the thylakoid membrane with <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-quenching capacity like plastoquinone and &#x003b1;-tocopherolquinone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] were not quantified but might also be affected in some of the mutants. Thus, reduced photoprotection by the combination of lower xanthophylls, &#x003b1;-tocopherol and maybe other deficiencies might be the cause for increased <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production and <italic>GPXH </italic>expression in these mutants. This could either result from mutations in multiple loci, as found for clone 22D1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), or caused by mutations in a single gene encoding for a global regulator of cellular photoprotection mechanisms.</p><p>Even though deepoxidation of xanthophylls is involved in NPQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], these parameters did not correlate in our mutants (R<sup>2 </sup>&#x0003c; 0.01) indicating that other factors also play an important role for NPQ. For example, two strains of group I (18F6 and 18G9) showed rather increased NPQ levels under LL conditions even though their xanthophyll levels were reduced, clustering them in a separate subgroup (IB) of group I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Very high <italic>GPXH </italic>expression in 18F6 and 18G9 under ML conditions indicates stimulated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>generation already at LL. We speculate that these mutants might have increased <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production due to an enhanced energy transfer from the PSII reaction center to molecular oxygen. By this, quenching of excitation energy by molecular oxygen would increase NPQ but reduce the photosynthetic electron transport rate required for building up the proton gradient and activating the xanthophyll cycle. Thus, reduced xanthophylls would not be the cause but the consequence of increased <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production. However, other effects of the mutations cannot be excluded which might also explain these phenotypes.</p><p>Contrary to 18F6 and 18G9, two mutants (14A9 and 21B4 in group IIA) had strongly reduced NPQ both under LL and HL conditions but similar or rather increased xanthophyll levels compared to wild-type showing that defects in qE-independent mechanisms seem to affect NPQ in these mutants. Photoinhibition (qI) stimulated by excess light should not be relevant under LL conditions, and a deficiency in state transition (qT) should not strongly affect NPQ at HL intensities. On the other hand, a qE-independent effect was also found in a <italic>C. reinhardtii </italic>mutant defective in two linked <italic>LHCSR3 </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, segregation analysis of backcrosses of 14A9 and 21B4 with a wild-type strain revealed that both mutants have probably mutations in two different genes affecting <italic>GPXH </italic>expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) indicating that the phenotypes of these mutants could be caused by the combination of different defects.</p><p>In mutants with functional detoxification mechanisms, strong <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>accumulation after stimulated production of the ROS might be prevented by the induction of these detoxification mechanisms. This is supported by the negative correlation of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>formation and deepoxidation of xanthophylls, where increased levels of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin correlate with a low stimulation of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Mutants with increased xanthophyll levels are mainly represented in the group IIB mutants of cluster analysis with rather few and weak phenotypic changes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). A general increase in antioxidant levels including zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin, lutein and &#x003b1;-tocopherol and a significant rise in NPQ was detected in strain 14H8, where no stimulated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production and <italic>GPXH </italic>expression could be measured any more. This shows that the various protection mechanisms can compensate each other and thus control the production of deleterious ROS. This is in agreement with data of various mutants lacking specific antioxidants: &#x003b1;-tocopherol-deficient strains of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, <italic>Synechocystis sp</italic>. PCC6803 and <italic>A. thaliana </italic>all were very tolerant to photooxidative stress during HL conditions, and only under extreme conditions such as a combination of very HL and low temperature or chemical treatment a phenotype became visible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It was suggested that the presence of other antioxidants such as zeaxanthin or increased levels of &#x003b2;-tocopherol can compensate for &#x003b1;-tocopherol deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Conversely, the <italic>A. thaliana npq1 </italic>mutant, lacking zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin, accumulates higher amounts of &#x003b1;-tocopherol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, zeaxanthin, &#x003b1;-tocopherol and plastoquinol have overlapping functions in photoprotection and together prevent the formation of deleterious <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>under natural conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, when these protection mechanisms are overwhelmed, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>starts to accumulate and damage cellular components. This is when defense genes like <italic>GPXH</italic>, which repair and remove damaged biomolecules, are required to survive the oxidative stress. Activation of genetic stress response without altering antioxidant levels by an acclimation to increased <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production or the direct overexpression of the <italic>GPXH </italic>gene in <italic>C. reinhardtii </italic>were shown to increased resistance to oxidative stress by RB, NR and t-BOOH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Increased tolerance against t-BOOH was also found for 13 of the 32 <italic>gox </italic>mutants tested including all the group IIB mutants as well as strains 14B5, 14C11 and 35H11 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Thus, increased expression of stress response genes like <italic>GPXH </italic>might explain the HL resistance of these mutants and shows the important role of <italic>GPXH </italic>and other defense genes in the photooxidative stress response of photosynthetic organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The failure to isolate <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>signal transduction mutants indicates that several redundant signaling pathways might be involved in the <italic>GPXH </italic>response.

Singlet oxygen generation, on the other hand, was altered in several mutants resulting in higher expression of the <italic>GPXH </italic>gene. Increased oxidative stress resistance of many of these mutants confirms the importance of the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-induced genetic response in the defense against ROS-induced damage. Furthermore, isolation of phenotypic different groups of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-overproducing mutants indicates that mutations in different photoprotective mechanisms might be responsible for higher <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>levels in various <italic>gox </italic>mutants which most seem to be, based on pigment analysis, different from known photoprotective mutants like <italic>npq1 lor1</italic>. The comparison of their phenotypes suggests that in several <italic>gox </italic>mutants multiple defense processes might be affected what might be due to, among other things, mutations in a global regulator of cellular photoprotection mechanisms.

In parallel, absorbance at 750 nm was measured to determine cell density and normalized ARS activity was calculated with the following equation:</p><p><disp-formula><mml:math id="M1" name="1471-2229-10-279-i1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ARS</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>&#x02009;</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>activity</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>slope</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>OD</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>410</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>OD</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>750</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>t</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>OD</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>750</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Relative <italic>GPXH-ARS </italic>expression was then calculated for each clone by dividing its ARS activity by the average control ARS activity.

Then 5 &#x003bc;l of each cultures was spotted on TAP plates containing the following chemicals: tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH: 100, 150, 200 and 250 &#x003bc;M), neutral red (NR: 4, 5, 8, 12 and 18 &#x003bc;M), rose bengal (RB: 2, 2.5, 3, 4 and 5 &#x003bc;M), metronidazole (MZ: 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 mM), methyl viologen (MV: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 &#x003bc;M). The plates were incubated at either LL (t-BOOH, MZ and MV) or ML (NR and RB), together with a control plate without any chemical for 3 to 4 days depending on the light intensity. High light resistance was tested by exposing 5 &#x003bc;l of cultures on a TAP plate to 500 &#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2 </sup>s<sup>-1 </sup>(HL) for 3 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Segregation analysis</title><p>Six mutants (14A9, 18F6, 18G9, 21B4, 22D1 and 35H11) were analyzed genetically for segregation of their phenotypes by crossing them to strain 4A<sup>- </sup>pYS1. The resulting zygospores were harvested and dissected as described in Harris (1989). For each mutant a total of twelve tetrads with four surviving cells each were analyzed for their <italic>GPXH-ARS </italic>expression pattern except for 18G9, which did not result in any viable progenies. <italic>GPXH-ARS </italic>expression analysis was performed as described above in three replicates per clone.</p></sec><sec><title>Singlet oxygen formation</title><p>Cultures grown under LL to 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>were adjusted to 3 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>-1 </sup>chlorophyll content, and 0.5 ml samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen to lyse the cells. After thawing, 100 &#x003bc;l of cell suspension were transferred to a black 96-well plate. To all the samples including two medium-only controls for background correction, 1 &#x003bc;l of a 1 mM Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green (SOSG) (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) solution was added. Fluorescence levels were measured as peak height at 530 nm (excitation 480 nm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] after 0 and 15 min of exposure to HL conditions (500 &#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) in a Tecan infinite<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>200 fluorescence plate reader. To confirm <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>detection by SOSG, fluorescence spectra of cultures exposed to the same light conditions in the presence of either 10 mM of the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>quencher 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) or in medium containing 50% deuterium oxide (D<sub>2</sub>O) were measured representatively for strain 22D1 in three independent replicates (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). As expected, DABCO reduced the fluorescence signal of SOSG by quenching <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>whereas D<sub>2</sub>O stimulated the signal because D<sub>2</sub>O increases the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>lifetime. Furthermore, no increased SOSG fluorescence could be measured in dark incubated algal samples compared to medium-only controls (background) confirming the detection of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>by SOSG. Singlet oxygen production for each strain was determined by calculating the slope of the increase in background-corrected SOSG fluorescent signals during the 15 min of exposure, and relative values were calculated for each mutant by dividing its levels by the levels of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>production in the wild-type strain.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)</title><p>Cells of 5 ml cultures grown to 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>at the light condition indicated were harvested by centrifugation. Total RNA was isolated by the Trizol method as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. For qPCR experiments, 200 ng of individual total RNA was used in each 10 &#x003bc;l reverse transcription reaction with a reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instruction.</p><p>Sequences of primers for qPCR were designed with the Primer Express&#x02122;software (Applied Biosystems). qPCR reactions were performed on the ABI Prism<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>7000 or 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Threshold cycle (C<sub>t</sub>) values were determined for all reactions in the logarithmic amplification phase, and the average C<sub>t </sub>value was calculated for each sample out of three technical replicates. Each reaction was confirmed to contain a single amplicon by gel electrophoresis and melting curves. Genomic DNA contamination in RNA samples was assessed by qPCR using RNA without reverse transcription as templates, and in all cases had at least six C<sub>t</sub>-values higher than that of respective cDNAs. The efficiency for the amplification of each product was determined by serial dilutions of template cDNA and used to correct C<sub>t </sub>values for variable amplification efficiencies. The C<sub>t </sub>values of the <italic>CBLP </italic>gene were used as the internal references. Relative expression was calculated for each mutant compared to 4A<sup>+ </sup>pYS1 under the same growth conditions as an average with standard error out of three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Pigment analyses</title><p>For tocopherol and pigment analysis, cells from 1 ml samples were harvested by centrifugation and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pigments and &#x003b1;-tocopherol were extracted by vortexing in 300 &#x003bc;l of acetone for 1 min, and the extracts were filtered through 2 &#x003bc;m nylon filters. Pigments were fractionated and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of NPQ</title><p>Chlorophyll fluorescence was determined with an imaging pulse amplitude modulated (IPAM) chlorophyll fluorescence system (IMAG-MAX/l, Walz, Germany). Mutants were grown under LL (15 &#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) or 250 &#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2 </sup>s<sup>-1 </sup>for 2 days up to a density of 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>before the cells of 200 &#x003bc;l of culture were collected on a glass microfiber filter (Whatman, UK) by vacuum filtration. To keep filters moist they were transferred on a wet paper towel and cells were dark adapted for 20 min before maximal chlorophyll fluorescence level <italic>F<sub>m </sub></italic>was determined. Then actinic light of the same intensity as growth light was turned on for 15 min before <italic>F<sub>m</sub>' </italic>was measured to calculate average NPQ as (<italic>F<sub>m</sub>-F<sub>m</sub>'</italic>)/<italic>F<sub>m</sub>' </italic>of five independent replicates.</p></sec><sec><title>Cluster analysis</title><p>Hierarchical gene clustering was performed using the Cluster 3.0 software. Data were first log transformed and normalized by multiplying all values of a parameter with a constant scale factor so that the sum of the squares of the values for each parameter was 1.0. This resulted in a scale factor for <italic>GPXH </italic>expression and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>formation of 7.1. For NPQ and pigment contents, which had similar maximal levels, a single scale factor (3.5) was calculated based on the parameter with the highest sum of squares (deepoxidation at LL). Clustering was performed based on average linkage and the results were visualized in a color-based expression pattern using the TreeView 1.60 software designed by the Eisen Lab <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rana.lbl.gov/">http://rana.lbl.gov/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Different parameters determined for individual mutant were analyzed for their significant differences to the same parameters measured in the wild-type strain using a paired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.
