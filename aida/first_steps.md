# Summary

In this project, my goal is to reproduce the entire repo: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/das-public

Here, I will try to explain in detail everything I have had to do.

1. First, you need to install Python, R and the required packages. 
* The list of required Python packages is found here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/das-public/blob/master/requirements.txt
* The list of required R packages is found here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/das-public/blob/master/install.R

I used to have Anaconda on my laptop, but I decided I wanted to use plan Python for this project. 
I uninstalled Anaconda, and then installed the most recent Python version.
