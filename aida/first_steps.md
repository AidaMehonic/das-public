# Summary

In this project, my goal is to reproduce the entire repo: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/das-public

Here, I will try to explain in detail everything I have had to do.

1. First, I needed to install Python, R and the required packages. 
* The list of Python packages is found here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/das-public/blob/master/requirements.txt
* The list of R packages is found here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/das-public/blob/master/install.R

I decided to install Anaconda first. 
Through Anaconda, I installed: 
* Qt Console, 
* RStudio and 
* CMD.exe Prompt.
