# Summary

In this project, my goal is to reproduce the entire repo: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/das-public

Here, I will try to explain in detail everything I have had to do.

1. First, I needed to install Python, R and the required packages. 
* The list of Python packages is found here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/das-public/blob/master/requirements.txt
* The list of R packages is found here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/das-public/blob/master/install.R

I had an old version of Anaconda and Python already installed on my laptop. 
I updated Anaconda to the newest version. Then I needed to also update Python to the newer version.
I did this by running the following terminal command: conda install python=3.6.
