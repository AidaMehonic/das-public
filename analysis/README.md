# Analysis

This folder contains R code to replicate all analyses done in the paper. It further contains a copy of the dataset we analysed in the paper, thus analyses can be reproduced independently from the creation of the dataset from scratch.

* [R models](r_models.R): code to replicate all analyses.
* [dataset/export_full.csv.zip](dataset/export_full.csv.zip): compressed copy of the analysed dataset.
